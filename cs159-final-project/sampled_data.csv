In my experience, the teen years were quite difficult, so I would say yes, that it did get better. Until it got worse again. Then better. Then worse. Then better. Many many wonderful things have happened during the good times. And I've survived 100% of my bad times. What I mostly have learned over these decades of illness, is that things always shift, eventually. I rely on docs, meds, therapy, and my spouse in bad times, and basically just ride it out.",0,

I've matured enough to manage my own personality (as in, not being one of those if you can't handle me at my worst, you don't deserve me at my best people).  Stick with what makes logical sense (you don't need to be successful in the graduating and having a high-paying job sense), not what people will validate, because they won't collectively validate everything that makes sense (namely, the idea in parentheses above: the same idea that you don't need to be successful; most people aren't going to validate that, so fuck them).

I ask because every single job (since graduating college) I've ever had has been a job where the company required a degree, but the job itself didn't necessary need the skills provided by a degree. They used the degree as a way to weed people out. I have a BA as well, and student debt, but I don't feel like it wasn't worth anything. Even though I took a pay cut with my new job (for better benefits), my income is still more than the average income for a family where I live. I say this because, at this point, you can't change that you got a BA. You just gotta accept it and don't dwell on the I should have dones because if you do, you'll just fuck yourself over and the negativity will eat you alive. Now, you just gotta make a plan - what can you do with your degree? What are some skills you learned from your degree and previous jobs that can transfer over to something else?

I hardly know them if I know them at all and I'm afraid to actually know them since they'll hate me or I'll drag them down.,"Yep. In conversations with my therapist, we have discussed me having some kind of attachment disorder around this. I am constantly seeking and craving connection with others. I can be at an airport and be thinking about connecting with other people. We traced it to childhood stuff (no surprise there) of abandonment and alienation, unmet emotional needs.  Then when and if I do connect, my expectations are pretty high since I am willing to do whatever to reach out to the other person and increase the connection. When that is not reciprocated to the expectations that I have (because they are not trying to fill the massive hole that I am), I feel rejected and then shut down. I internalize this sense as a rejection of me as a person (they don't like me, I'm not worth liking, they got to know and discovered i'm no good). Rinse. Repeat. That's my pattern at least. Knowing the pattern helps, but it doesn't mean I can always identify it and stop it. Thanks for letting me share.",0,

Ugh...,"I looked at your post history(sorry, I'm nosy) and what caught my eye was that you were upset that you feel girls don't find you attractive. The key there was you said you don't even bother talking to them. A fear of rejection is what keeps most people single, I think. Even just smiling at a girl when she walks by might make you feel better. If she gives you that, What do you want, weirdo? look, that's her insecurity, and those aren't the kind of people you want in your life anyways. Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. My problem is the opposite, I'm skinny as a rail and short. Upon putting myself out there, I found that some people actually think I'm attractive. You're your own worst critic, so I sincerely doubt your just un-lovably ugly. And about your weight, treat it like an RPG, make a game of losing weight. You'll start to feel better about yourself the more you lose. It can be kind of fun to work on yourself, especially when you start to see results.

dczav1d,"First time using anti depressant pills and feel really energized, hyped and my whole body is shaking is this normal?. I use 100 mg Sertalin and I am 17 yo","Yup. In my experience sertraline was more intense than (es)citalopram the first few days and I started slow at like 12.5mg.  It's really the first week - actually about the first 4 days - effect. The thing that requires the black box warning because it's a surprise if no one tells you to expect it (and not everyone gets it so powerfully).  If it's too intense talk to your doctor about cutting back and moving up slower (I've settled on 50mg and that was after titrating up). Try splitting it up into at least two doses so it doesn't all hit you at once - sertraline's got a relatively short serum life and I'm preferring a morning and afternoon dose.  ... and during this 'jittery' period try to take it at least 4 hours before bed so you'll have a shot at getting some proper sleep.  It gets a *lot* more boring (but still potentially helpful) once your body adapts! Right now all sorts of stuff is going on with your serotonin and it's pretty much the 'psychedelic' part. Once your system adjusts the idea is that the drug is holding a 'buffer' of serotonin in the synapses so it's there when you need it for more even moods and less discomfort, but until that settles down it can be pretty trippy and stimulating (especially with sertraline that has a nice extra dopamine stimulatory effect, which is pretty helpful offsetting some of the more annoying SSRI side effects in the longer term).  So if you feel like you're going to jump out of your skin now - yeah, that's normal, and it passes in about those 4-7 days (for me, anyway). Also heads-up that.. yeah, with sertraline, those days included a lot of nausea and (ahem) intense GI effects for me too - that passes too.",0,

df6xvka,Fuck. When you try to relate but you'd rather kill yourself.,"hi there, forgive me if I'm wrong with regards to what you are referring to. How I understand your statement is that you try to relate to others but rather do the latter. If this is the case, I want to let you know that even though sometimes you feel you are compelled to relate to other because of societal pressures, you really don't and it depends to what extent. It's important to be who you are and be with people where you can be who you are. But that doesn't mean your depressed you is who you are as a person. Your depression is only a part of who you are, not your defining being. Don't define yourself as 'a depressed person' but more so 'a person that has depression right now at this stage of my life.' Because depression goes away or can be managed very well where it doesn't intrude on your life in a daily or constant basis. You are much more than your depression. Try to take smell steps that you are comfortable with and learn some coping strategies in managing depressed feelings. Ideally it'll be great if you can see a therapist but I understand that has it's own restrains. The key thing is to never give up on yourself because when you believe, there will be a way out of this. I always tell others that healing isn't easy but it's worth it because you are worth it, whether you feel it right now or not.",0,

duy7ld1,What is it like to seek help as a minor. 14 years old and am depressed and have issues with anxiety and self harm. If i tried to seek help with a doctor what process would I go through and what would most likely happen. in the U.S. if it makes a difference,"it *probably* depends on the state (edit: what state in the US). being 14, you are going to be tethered to your parent/guardian legally. the therapist/counselor/psychologist will be legally required to tell your guardians of anything that serves of specific risk. for example, i told my therapist that i was suicidal and he had to contact my mother and explain the basics of the situation. for self harm, im not sure exactly how/if the information would be disclosed by the therapist/counselor/psychologist to your parents.. but im assuming if you are physically hurting yourself to a GREAT EXTENT then yes, it would most likely be disclosed.  im 18 now, and started seeing my on-campus(university) therapist and psychiatrist at the beginning of the school year, where i was 17. it sucks not being in control of your life, but what can you do, you know?  if getting to see a therapist is an issue, i would recommend asking to talk to your doctor/pediatrician in private (during a normal check-up) and say tht youve had symptoms of depression/anxiety and you'd like to have some help talking to your parent about getting help. if it's not an issue of talking to your parent/guardian, then what's the worry? if you cant see a doctor, a school counselor could help you have this conversation with your parent! or even a supportive teacher that you trust.  i went through a very similar situation when i was younger, and very much regret not being more persistent about getting help when i needed it. it mght not go away, and with school only getting harder and more stressful as you age, it's *really hard* to deal with all this emotional baggage. everyone deserves to feel the best that they can.  you dont want to suffer anymore and someday you wont! feel free to pm me, i'd be happy to be your pen-pal through all this &lt;3",0,

cyn6pwj,I want to die. That's all I have to say,"Most of us on this subreddit have been/are there. I know i have. I tend to dwell on the past far too often and besides it's obvious drawbacks it does have one advantage. Remembering the time i did want to die and how I thought there was no other way out. But I decided to live and I haven't actually wanted to die since. Sure things suck, most of the time for longer than we'd like but there are alot of things that make life on this planet right now worth living. I personally am not religious. I think once your dead it's lights out and I very much enjoy consciousness. I only felt what it was like living without it once or twice and those were not pleasant experiences. I'm still technically Depressed, I have been most of my life and likely will be until it's over or I find what it is i need to do with myself to get there. What helped me go from uber frustrated to content is to continue to evolve. I cut off everyone i knew and reevaluated what I want in life... Apparently it's living in a van and not staying anywhere long enough to feel stagnant. I'm not at all a people person and i have a family full of happy go lucky dimwits who talk nonsense and gossip repeating the same routine like that i what life is. That's not what i want. To be happy you need to forget about everyone and their bullshit, and be who you are where you are. Experience what life is, don't waste it and don't throw it away before you've lived it fully. I'm stuck right now, been hibernating as my little brothers personal housekeeper because my anxiety drives me to near agoraphobia. But once i get out of here I'll take all the lessons I've learned on /r/vandwellers and start my life as i know it should be and hopefully that brings me piece of mind for once. That's what works for me, but if your not an antisocial INTP then you might not want to live in a van lol. But I'm sure there is some way you see life should be... There's an entire world out there, look at the room around you and remember that's less than a microbe in the grand scheme of things. Do what what want do what drives you, not what you think is expected of you. It's your life, you are the one setting the standards and accepting them. Fuck everyone else.",0,

du2oncc,"Post-suicide Questions I Wanted to Ask. I started writing my letters today and I wondered how people would receive them if they were electronic. These letters arent really something I can handwrite in a timely manner without having the courage to keep writing.  Do the police access the computer and shift through the belongings to find the letters or wouls I have to send them out myself to have them delivered? What happens to my belongings? If I lock myself in a nonshared dorm room and kill myself, how long would it take to find my body and who would be responsible for cleaning it up? Would it leave my family in debt? Would blowing my head off or hanging myself leave my body in a state where it's unusable for a funeral?  I'm turning 20 in 2 months and I'm just too tired. Id like to finally be able to rest and not have to live a conitant life of fear and sadness. As much as I do not want to keep living this kind of life, I am too tired to keep pushing through any longer and I'd just like for my death to be somewhat feasible for my mom and sibling.","the thing, though, your death be feasible. Your mom and sibling would spend the rest of their lives wondering if it was something they did or said that pushed you over the edge, or thinking about what they could have done differently to be there for you. One of both of them would likely spiral into a depression of their own. I used to think that no one would miss me much if I killed myself, but always remember the sound of my brothers voice when he found me with blood pouring from my arm. That something that you can just get over. Even leaving notes really help the pain for your family. Also consider the suffering of the people who found you. It could be an RA or a dorm mate. They would be traumatized for life, with severe PTSD from seeing a dead, decomposing body. That point would be too late for you to do anything, so we try not to let it go that far. get me wrong, I know where coming from, and not trying to make you feel bad for would be wrong. And clear from the fact that even thinking about these things that you have some reservations, so build on that. Take every little good thing that happens to you and imagine never feeling that way again, and imagine robbing the people you love of those feelings as well. Forgive me for being brash, but there is absolutely nothing delicate or glorious about suicide. The people who experience it secondhand go through ten times the suffering of the people who commit it.

It's like a curse of chance your either lucky enough to not have it come down on your or your one of the unfortunate ones to have it happen.,"I think it's a matter of perspective. Bad things happen to everyone, but how you react makes a difference. I don't see the point of complaining. If I'm upset or feel like I've been dealt a bad hand, I look for a solution. In the past, I used to beat myself up over all my screw ups or when I felt I wasn't treated right. I realize now that everyone goes through the same type of things and you can't fight them. Adults have the same issues with heartbreak and money trouble as teens, the only difference is they think they're experienced. No one is experienced. Everything that happens to you is the first time that unique situation happened to your unique person. Your reaction is the only thing that changes how these events affect you. I know it's generalizing a bit, but if only good things happen to happy people, it's because those people tend to focus on the good things that happen to them and view the bad things that happen as an obstacle that they need to overcome. They don't wallow. Having confidence that you will overcome these negative events helps portray the happy personality.",0,

Because without it, we will be too dependent on others and that becomes burdensome because no one's life is perfect and they all have their own issues to deal with. Even though other people wants to love you and support you, they can only do it to a certain extent. The rest of the void that you have inside of you can only be filled by yourself. I know you don't feel it but being able to learn to self love is the key to happiness because that is when you feel like your life is in your control again, not on others.

The worst part is that you can't exactly warn them about how you're really feeling and the reason why you're pushing them away because it's hard for them to understand, potentially making everything way more complicated. I don't know enough about you but I know that my heart is fragile so I put up a wall around me to protect it.

egv3ma1,What do you do every day when you're suffering depression?. I really wanna know how other people live their life. I know myself too much but have no clue what depression is like to others.  Thanks.,"I tend to go back to sleep over and over, and I eat at dinner time. spend the nights playing video games and then I oversleep. I need a balance of alone time and time with friends to start feeling like myself again, and if I get that balance wrong I can meltdown. I tend to downplay my problems to the people around me and upplay them to strangers. For example, inflate things for the sake of a conversation with some crisis volunteer or something, just to get some free sympathy and support that I have to feel weird about later because I see that person again. But, if a friend asks me how doing, my first reaction is to reply I have good friends so they call me out on this.  I self sabotage by missing appointments or shutting out natural light. If cold, thirsty, hungry or uncomfortable, I ignore it and let myself suffer. I know getting better when I start doing certain things for myself. If I make myself some tea or get more blankets or sit somewhere other than my bed, I tell myself because I care about myself and want to feel better. I have physical pain associated with depression, usually I feel an ache in my arms and legs. When I have the energy I stretch to alleviate it. This also helps me feel better.  I have to be conscious of whether I have the energy to do something, because if I force myself I could get overwhelmed and just sink further down. had to learn to say no to people when what they ask of me is more than I can provide without suffering later. But, for the most part, learned my depression will leave when good and ready. been going downhill for two months and had a meltdown a few nights ago so been thinking a lot about what I really need to get through these times. These depressed phases tend to last 4-6 months for me so still got a long way to go. This my first rodeo, though, prepared. learned that there are plenty of little things I can do that feel like self care. Self care is not always an elaborate bath with essential oils and red wine. To me self care is getting up to make a cup of tea, spending a couple minutes stretching, or ordering food when hungry instead of waiting until everything is closed and starving. It have to make you feel better all at once, but all those little things add up, and it means more when you put conscious value on it. will stretch so my body hurt so much, and I do this because I care about feeling I say to myself. I meant for this to be short...... and then it Hang in there.",0,

ds58dos,one question. I'll keep it simple. Can there be happiness in despair? Because I think I felt it and I want to kill off any hope that's left for me.,"That's a pretty profound question, but I think happiness is something that a lot of people don't understand. In a period or prolonged period of despair, I don't believe there can be happiness at all, and it's only after that period has been solved, over, attacked enough by effort and time, that you can start experiencing happiness. I don't think happiness and gratitude should be forced, or you should try to feel happy when you truly cannot feel happy. I'm still going through that period, and there might be rivets or jewels of happiness along the way, but they are fleeting and leave very quickly.  The whole reason why people despair is because they are tied so strongly to negative emotional memories that they outweigh any trivial positive emotional memories. Think about it, which memories are the quickest, strongest, and most easily able to be remembered for you? The most emotional ones.  If your most emotional memories are negative, you will be in despair. On the converse, if one's most emotional memories are positive, you will be in a state of happiness.  There is a way to end your despair, you just have to face it head on and let go of everything, and keep trying to let go and accept. Very few people have any science on this and might be the thing we need to explore the most as a society as a whole.",0,

dlzesc7,Laziness or lack of motivation.. How have some of you battled depression related laziness?,"Hi Talk2muchaa,  Lik onus111 suggested, 'feeling like doing something' just does not happen. If you're deeply unhappy with a lack of activity in your life, you just need to force yourself to do it - That's the sad reality of it. HOWEVER, that doesn't mean that there aren't ways to make FORCING yourself 'easier' on your mind and less stressful. If you want to build a house consisting of a 1000 bricks, take 30 seconds a day to lay 3 bricks and in one year, you will have a house.  You can't punish yourself for not building Rome in a day. You will go on Twitch and see streamers who are making millions... YouTubers who are making millions. I mean fuck, PewDiePie has 56 million subscribers.  But that shit didn't happen in just one day. You need to break shit up into increments. Perhaps others don't have to do this. But it's the only way I've found to get anything done. If you want to learn a language, go on Duolingo. Set a '10 points per day' challenge. Yes, it's jack-shit in terms of work. It takes literally 2 minutes a day, BUT- it's something.  Try and ignore your brain saying Increase the goal to 50 a day, we're getting fuck-all done because this will break your discipline and you'll go back to 0 a day.  Consistently doing 10 a day for 11 days, is better than doing 50 a day for 2 days, burning out and stopping altogether. The key to beating depression-induced laziness is TINY, incremental steps. For example, I'm learning Calculus on Khan Academy. One. Lesson. A Day.  That's right- the average Khan video is around 10 minutes. I do one video a day. I am slowly, but consistently learning. Each day I go over the notes from the previous day. The problem isn't volume- it's consistency.",0,

One time I was gone for a couple of months. I only went back when I became physically ill and couldn't afford meds. I begged my parents to let me come home and buy my prescriptions. I had a terrible UTI and bladder infection. Going back home was terrible and good at the same time. I was sad to be home, my parents were angry with me and told me all the terrible things they believed about me while I was gone. Things they heard from other people and things I think they imagined. About 80% were completely untrue. I was a disappointment and a sinner. I was sad to be away from my boyfriend and glad to be away from him at the same time. He was considerably older than I and of course I had envisioned our life together as different. The second time I ran away I had a better plan partly. I took my clothes and anything else I could throw in my friends car and went to her house where she lived with her grandparents. The next morning I woke up to my Step Mom standing at my feet telling me to get up and come with her and Dad. I grew up very depressed, my Mother passed away when I was 2 1/2 years old, then my older sister passed away few years later. Every day I was sad. I didn't understand what happened, I didn't understand how something so terrible could happen and life changed drastically and in a flash. No one talked to me about any of it and I was broken. Walking to school in the morning, thru classes all day, walking home in the afternoon, having dinner, staring into the void during homework time, staring at the ceiling at night trying to go to sleep, I had a huge pain in my chest and I was alone.",0,

Or, feel lonely and haven't got anybody; need to find somebody to stop feeling like that; need to know best places to find somebody; research ways to meet people and put self into that situation. Or feel worthless; being of use to someone or something would make me feel less worthless; dedicate myself to making myself of use to someone who needs somebody; use free time aiding charity or institution where people need you, and you can feel needed.  Honestly, I know it's not that easy a fix, and there will be more bumps to overcome. One of my larger problems is isolation and loneliness, and even having looked at places to go, I still haven't found the courage to put myself into a situation to meet people. But generating a simple starting point where you can do something easily achievable, even just through reading online about how to get started, can make you feel proactive and start to get you into a more productive feeling that maybe it won't be like that forever, and that there is a physical, tangible, mortal way to deal with the situation. So, I would recommend pick a small goal that CAN lead to some form of happiness and work towards that, rather than try to envision this great milestone of achieving happiness in one big leap. Helps you take it day by day a little easier, and I hope that would make each new day, if not better, at least consistent for you. Feel better soon, bud.",0,

There is use for these medications but should be far more proper professional analysis before determining the correct meds, and monitoring. Lack of health care support means throwing the most widely used ones at a patient, refer a psych and hope for the best.  They are not terrible, can help in many people but take so long to be effective and are hit and miss so its a tough solution when in a present difficult crisis.

With very few exceptions, the only people I know who consider HS the best years are people who are completely and totally miserable adults who are looking back with rose-colored glasses at a time when their parents paid for everything. College is better for most people, but the partying and crap is highly overrated once you're old enough to look back a bit. I don't know anyone who misses that stuff. But what are the best years? I think once you hit your mid-20s things really start to look up. Odds are, your career is at least starting to actually materialize, you aren't as emotionally immature anymore and things don't bother you like they used to, and generally speaking the odds are that things are more stable overall.

It actually isn't really much worse than it has always been. I read a certain amount of history and have come to realize this.

Living is not that easy :( I think I kinda wanna die ...,"Hi friend! :) I'm really sorry you're in such pain :( sometimes the people we have around us can't see the pain we're in because they don't want to (they may see it, not know how to help us, and are afraid to because it may cause them pain).  This may seem like useless advice, but it can greatly help if you tell the other people exactly how you're feeling and ask them to try and help you. Nobody will ever be inside your head and able to experience exactly what you are feeling, but by talking to them and letting them know, you can help them to understand you. Sometimes we have to do the hardest part of reaching out ourselves. I had to tell my best friend I was feeling suicidal, but by telling her she helped me turn my life around. She just didn't realise. It's never easy to do, but I can promise you that you are so much stronger than you know, and there are always people willing to listen and to try to understand what you're going through.  Lastly, I hope you don't die. Not until you've been able to live the life that you want, the life that you deserve to have. I'm sending you love and luck.",0,

Find any average girl in her late twenties or older, and they'll likely be able to tell you some things they did to dudes they weren't proud of after the fact, but at the time, seemed like the most sane and logical thing, something they needed to do. Guys do the same, just in a different manner. On both sides, it hurts like hell, and is something everyone goes through.  Focus on yourself. Not the Tony Robbins rah-rah go you!

You pour your heart and soul out and do everything you can in order to make that special person happy. But keep in mind that they ask you to go above and beyond. That was a choice you made. not fair to expect them to reciprocate when the one who wanted to pamper them... I think that instead of trying to you should voice your thoughts to her. You can explain how you feel. That you hope they can try to be more ... affectionate, attentive, appreciative, etc. This is a relationship. Communication is so important but more importantly is respect for each other. If u care about her try and make her sad because hurt. And sometimes it takes time for a relationship to build trust and affection. Some people as good at dating as others. I hope doing okay whether you stay with her or not.",0,
dcu0s45,Can someone who has been through depression describe what it is like to be done with it?. I just want to know what awaits us one day.,"I saw your post several hours ago and I've been thinking all afternoon about what you asked. I'm not sure if I can fully explain the shift I made from being depressed and suicidal to the generally happy person I am now. There was a whole series of decisions and lessons and realizations I've made over a period of several years which probably merits its own post (or series of them). I joined this subreddit a short time ago and have been sort of lurking, trying to understand this community and seeing if I have anything to contribute, and your post makes me realize that maybe just telling my story will help others make their own way on their journey.  To answer your specific question, the one thing I have come to understand is that there really isn't going to be a time when you are entirely done with it. There will always be a chance, however small, that you can fall back into it. However the longer you go without falling back in, the easier it gets. I tend to think of it in terms of black holes and orbital bodies. I'm going to have to create a post on that.  The truths I've found is that recovery and freedom from depression is about breaking habitual negative lines of thought by replacing it with more positive ones. It's about learning how to recognize when you are falling back into the pit of depression, and being able to pull yourself back out. It's about accepting and finding value in yourself, and finding many many reasons to continue to be alive, to contribute and interact with the rest of the world. Coming from the other side, I understand so many things that I used to see as negative really don't have any sort of positive or negative connotation. That was all in my head. Often those negative connotations were put there by others, sometimes inadvertently, sometimes deliberately. I had to learn how to strip those ideas off and choose a new set of ideas to assign. I learned how to identify what kind of ideas were worth keeping and using, and which ones were not and discard them.  I know this doesn't really explain much how I see things now, and how I no longer feel depressed all the time, but I promise to share my story in the hopes of helping you understand how I got where I am, and maybe help you make a similar journey.",0,

You may not know what the fuck that is yet, 'cause I sure as fuck didn't, but with time you really will. It may be to keep watch over delicate friends. It may be to provide entertainment by being a funny motherfucker, it might be there because you're a genius that doesn't know how to communicate with the rest of us idiots. My point is, you're clearly an intelligent person that struggles with emotional bombardment, and treat it like that. Suicide isn't as easy as people say.

People would call you or I selfish, but who are they to assign life or the absence thereof. Many people can't relate to such feelings of loneliness and unworth. But for those who can, being called selfish for suicidal thoughts, makes it all the more confusing of a situation. It also shows you who really cares, cause calling you selfish is just choosing the victim route, for themselves, which is fucked. While some may call it manipulation. Whatever the name, it's hardly sympathetic, and isnt even close to empathetic. Which, empathy, is what this world is lacking. A partnership society would support each other regardless of their stance or tradition. But, we live in a male dominated, monotheistic world. People suck. The only thing we can do is help them.

e5bqhow,How do you feel. What is life with depression? Tell me your story,"To answer your question, I'm actually feeling alright today. Had an existential crisis last night and probably would have ended up killing myself or at the very least cutting myself if it wasn't for my dog licking my hand as I layed in bed crying myself to sleep (she's NEVER an affectionate dog, it took me a minute to even realise that she was actually licking my hand and I wasn't imagining shit). Thanks, Charlie.  Anyways, for me depression is like absolute insanity. It's not just sadness or feeling like killing myself every other week. Just pure insanity. The best example I can give is probably two years ago, seventh grade. That was probably the lowest I had ever been. Every night when I went to sleep, I'd stay up on my phone. Not because I wanted to be, because it kept me from going to sleep and having the same nightmares I had every night. And then I'd look at the time, which by now was probably about 12 AM, realise how absolutely sad and pathetic I was and turn on some emo music, usually being something like Set it Off's I'll Sleep When I'm Dead and listen to that as I (literally) sadistically laugh and cry myself to sleep. Some nights, that kind of stuff never happened. I'd have a peaceful sleep. Some nights I'd stay up all night debating whether I should text the suicide hotline, doing so, and it being no help whatsoever.  So I'd get, maybe six hours of sleep at most. Before I'm woken up and have to get ready for school. How am I woken up? By my parents during the best part of my dream or the most peaceful part of my nightmare. Which already started my day off terribly. Then for an hour I'd be in the bathroom once again listening to emo music as I let the shower water run. My favourite songs to listen to were usually just about anything by Hollywood Undead. Not something a twelve year old should be listening to, sure. But it was a way to cope with my depression. As I listen to those songs, once again sadistically laughing at my own pain and often times end up cutting myself. I never cut myself deep, I was far to afraid of doing that. But... I enjoyed seeing the blood come out. I didn't cut for any sort of high or release of pain. It was sort of hard to explain. I was never addicted to cutting, I could stop or start whenever I wanted. Sometimes stopping for months at a time, but seeing the blood, made me feel happy. If you could have seen my eyes, especially when I cut myself, you wouldn't have seen any traces of a twelve year old. You'd see an insane person desperately trying to grasp on to the last straw of sanity, but nothing else. Some days I'd debate whether I should do a sort of murder-suicide thing. Or at the very least murder those who have caused me pain and suffering. Sometimes I'd have very and scarily elaborate plans on how I'd trick, kidnap, or kill my family. Things that you'd never expect from a twelve year old. But quite frankly, I might have physically been twelve, but my depression had probably aged and matured me way faster. The ride to school was probably the most traumatic for me. The ride was only about ten minutes (five minutes to school, five minutes in the carpool line). But those ten minutes were full of tests streaming down my face, me punching myself or ripping my hair out, or destroying my notebooks or pencils. Sometimes because I just really didn't want to go to school. Sometimes because my social anxiety got the best of me. Sometimes for reasons I don't even know. Me and my grandma would usually sit at the front of the school for about an hour or two, I'm sitting there trying to find a way to hurt myself because I'm angry, but don't want to let my anger out on her, and she's crying because she's absolutely lost on how to help me. I'd usually end up getting to school about a good three hours late.  In school, I don't remember anything. Maybe it's because I was just walking around the school like a robot. Class for an hour, find your next class, repeat. In class, I'd have my head down in a book (not paying attention to the teacher whatsoever), I'd be mindlessly reciting the emo songs I listen to in my head, or I'd be talking to my friend AIDEN. (Yes, his name is in all caps). What I do definitely remember is hating all of my peers. Hell, I still hate them. It's not my hatred for them itself. It's just I can't stand how immature, idiotic, and stupid they were. Like who the hell goes around sticking Tide pods in their mouths for views on social media? Or who thinks it's funny to go around telling people to kill themselves because you heard your favourite edgy YouTuber say it and now you think it's hilarious to do so. Or why do you think it's cool and okay to curse every five seconds and use the N-word? Or why do you think that because you saw Kim Kardashian half naked in some photo shoot that you can show up to school with hardly any clothes on or sag and talk about fucking whores because your favourite rapper said it in their newest song? Act your own god damn age, quit trying to act like someone three times your age while being as immature as a kindergartener.  More on AIDEN: AIDEN sort of just appeared out of nowhere. I don't know when or why I came up with him, I just sort of did. I'm not schizophrenic, he was 100% my own voice talking back to me in my head, but I enjoyed pretending to have someone to talk to. Someone who walked around with me everyday, knew exactly what I was thinking, and could relate to me all the time. Someone who (though was just my own voice), talked me out of suicide many times back in 7th grade. But slowly I started treating AIDEN a lot more like a real person. To the point where I could have easily been mistaken as someone with schizophrenia.  At home I'd just go into my room and basically lock myself in. My door was never locked, my parents could come in and out as they pleased, but I would just hand out under the covers all day. I didn't want to see light, light didn't want to see me. I didn't bother with homework. I figured, I fail, I fail. I really had just given up with life at that point. The only reason why I hadn't killed myself was probably because I was too sad and lazy to bother trying. Occasionally I'd talk to AIDEN or watch YouTube or something, but most times I ended up listening to hypnosis. Hypnosis for me was like a way to escape real life. Like meditation, but instead of being left alone with my sad and depressing thoughts, I could listen to someone else. At first it was a nice little escape, but then it more or less because an addiction. An odd strange one that I'd never be able to explain to anyone, but an addiction none the less. I'd try to listen to hypnosis any time I could even if that meant going into my room away from family to listen to it. It kind of gave me the same high that cutting, smoking, drugs, or porn give other people. Even though it was just hypnosis, it really did become unhealthy. Before I knew it, it was time for me to go to bed. And then the whole cycle would repeat itself over and over and over and over and over again. It was the same routine, same schedule, same insanity over and over again. This sounds like more is going on than just depression, right? Like some other underlying mental illness. But this is all depression and a bit of social anxiety. No MPD, no schizophrenia, no bipolar disorder, I'm not a psychopath or sociopath. This was all thanks to my depression.  No one actually knew how bad my mental state was. I never told anyone. I was diagnosed with depression and put on meds, but if anyone really knew how bad it was, I likely truly would have been put in a mental health hospital. This is where the most insane part was, since being on my meds, I'm a lot more stable. But I miss being the way I was. Even though they were supposed to, my meds didn't help my depression. It really just made me more stable. Now without AIDEN or cutting myself or the enjoyment of listening to emo music as I sadistically laugh and cry at the same time, I just feel empty. Though I was completely fucked up, it was still fun a times to laugh at how much I hate myself and my life. Now I can't do those things anymore. It's like being insane was a big part of me and my depression. The insanity itself was taken away, but the depression was still left. Now there's just a big, empty, dark hole.",0,

I'm just asking I guess if you want to explain why you're stuck living for other people rather than yourself.",2,"If the life you're living isn't making you happy, it's not what you want, why don't you change it?|"
djzoxjg,Getting a crush while depressed is terrible. You know nothing will happen and you can't get them out your head. At least it rivals suicidal thoughts in frequency though i guess.,"Yeah I have a crush on a girl who lives in my same city, she's just perfect, I'd like to talk to her often and to smile when she is near me but I'm just thinking if she would miss me if I die, I was also used to write her but then I stopped thinking that I was annoying her, now I hardly think she is just laughing about me with her friends but I can't get angry with her for that, she's too beautiful.",0,
dog300t,"Depressed for no reason.. Title says it all. Do you guys have any advice? I can't really do homework or sport in this state and I'm bored all day long, despite having lots of stuff to do that I previously enjoyed. Thanks.",You do not need a reason to be depressed and there is no reason to feel guilty for being depressed for no reason.,0,
e1ruepi,"I seem to always be the first to try and help someone else with their problems, yet when I need help nobody seems to be around to be an open ear for me, I wish I had someone in real life who cared enough to listen to me and just let me spill everything out. Anyone else feel this way?","I'm not entirely certain what reaction you're getting, but I hope you'll give those around you a little slack if they can't be as openly receptive and caring as you need at first. I'm sort of the designated problem solver in my circle, so quite a few of my friends come to me for advice and sympathy. It's never, never a burden. Instead, it's an honor. They trust me with their secrets, their problems, and value my opinion enough to ask for it. Reverse the situation. Aren't you glad when someone comes to you? The thing is, not everyone is built for that. Especially, I have found, it can sort of weird people out when the Rock, the Stable One, the One Person In This Messed Up World Who Has Their Stuff Together needs help. I mean, here's the person they go to and they rely on when they need support... and that person needs support. Suddenly you're not Superman anymore and it can be a bit disconcerting. Perhaps try introducing A problem at a time, slowly, and seeing if they can get used to you also being a normal human with issues. Good luck!!",0,

eflfjyl,Does it ever freak you out to realize that you’ll never be stable enough for a healthy relationship?. I see me having any romantic relationship &amp; getting married in the future. Been depressed and emotional my since my teen years. Medication doing me any miracles. Getting into a relationship is just a recipe for disaster at this point. Proven with my last failed 8 year relationship,"It's something that I've had to think long and hard about. I think I reached the conclusion that I simply wasn't good enough for a romantic relationship all the way back when I was twelve yeas old though, so I guess it really isn't something new. I'm in my early 20s. I think the fact that people my age are getting married left and right just kind of brings the issue to the forefront of my mind, but it doesn't really matter. Relationships and love are all bullshit anyways, just like pretty much everything in life. Maybe I just see things that way because I have had to experience life as myself. It's unfortunate, really.",0,
dgldm2v,why do i constantly cry for help and turn it down when i ACTUALLY get help. i feel like such an attention whore,"When I felt this way, I came to the conclusion that I didn't know who I was without these feelings. I didn't know what I liked anymore, would I be empty without this sadness? That sort of thought process, it was a lot of fear that drove me away from help. It's natural to be afraid of things changing. But when you feel ready to, these changes are for the better.",0,

Last week I only had 2 hours where the sun was up and I did what I wanted, and Im not a bloody owl, Im being a prisoner in this endless cycle of bullshit.",High school is incredibly strict. I suggest dropping out of any AP courses you may be in and taking early -college courses instead. They're much easier and by FAR more worthy of your time.,0,
dcdx1kl,How do you know if you have depression?. I think I have clinical depression and social anxiety. I really don't want to see a therapist until I have things mostly confirmed.,"If you think you have it, you probably do. If you see a therapist they'll give you pretty much the same questionnaire that you can find online. I recommend seeing a therapist soon. The diagnosis isn't really important, if your mental health is affecting your ability to live a normal, happy life, then you need to see someone. Good luck.",0,
