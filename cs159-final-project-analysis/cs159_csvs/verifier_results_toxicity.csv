251263251.32055.32055,"On behalf of federal web managers, I would like to get some clarification and guidance and maybe start a discussion regarding employees of the federal government editing Wikipedia articles. I primarily mean civil servants rather than political appointees and specifically as part of our responsibility to provide accurate information to the public. We recognize that Wikipedia is a frequent resource for many Internet users, including us. Our log files show that federal websites receive many referrals from Wikipedia. And many of us support and respect the work that the Wikipedia community does to create quality articles. We understand and have studied policies and guidelines, and more than one of us have edited a page or two. I am reaching out to the Wikipedia community to help us develop appropriate guidelines and policies for external_link and our participation. COI guidelines seem to discourage employees from editing on behalf of employers, but we frequently see information that is unclear or sometimes wrong. While we know we can just edit, we want to do so transparently and acceptably. There is concern that we will offend the Wikipedia community and encourage negative attention if we get this wrong. On the other hand, there are great resources in the federal (and state and local) space that would be valuable to Wikipedia users, and we know about them, and can cite them, too. So, what are the best ways for federal employees to contribute to this project? For example, some federal editors will only edit in their official capacity from a government computer with a government IP and from a Wikipedia account. Should that account indicate the name of the agency? Whether it is a communications or a program office? I don't think there would be any controversy on editing dates that are incorrect or improving a reference or correcting an error (like which agency has jurisdiction over an area). Are there things that we ''shouldn't'' edit? For substantive changes, should we be explicit about our roles on talk pages? If we don't get any feedback on proposed changes, how long should we wait until we make the change ourselves? Other ideas/areas/pitfalls? The goal is to create guidelines and best practices for the federal web community. We will publish on external_link. I am happy to move this to another area if that makes more sense, and if you want to post comments and discussion on my page, please do. Thanks for your help.

I realise, accept and understand that 'credit crunch' is a much-used term over recent months, much as is its counterpart (?) 'wiki_link'. However, I observe that both articles were created circa mid- to late- 2007 ie. in recent months. Taking this article, it has the approach of a theoretical treatise on what a 'credit crunch' is and why one may occur. It does not back this up to an acceptable degree with academic or other economically-authoritative sources. The best it's got is an FT article. This is because there are no text books, no journal papers, no lecture notes or anything of that sort available to help write an encyclopedic article at present. It is an original synthesis of observed effects in the media, a couple of which have citation to newspaper stories. Things like diagnosing that they often follow a period of loose credit is to reverse engineer the current situation to produce a novel, if predictable, notion. There are other examples, too. This kind of original synthesis is exactly what wiki_link forbids, unfortunately. I see two routes out of the conundrum of wanting an article on ''the'' credit crunch whilst trying to write about ' ''all'' ' credit-crunches (of which I speculate there have been no other events so named): Somebody proves me comprehensively wrong and finds authoritative, academic, or otherwise peer-reviewed sources we can cite in this tertiary source. (My preferred route). This is rewritten to discuss the proceedings of the present financial turmoil, and is mercilessly stripped of the imputations, interpolations and extrapolations it currently possesses.

Knowing that you have been a significant contributor to the article wiki_link, perhaps you could provide an alternate opinion. Even though it wasn't the first or deadliest school shooting, I still believe it was a very notable event that affected the nation and world in many ways in the year 2008 (gun politics, higher education, mental health, journalism ethics, video game politics, emergency preparedness, etc.). I even backed it up with three international sources (from Australia and the U.K.), which I felt demonstrated the event's global importance. Unfortunately, people disagreed with that. Mind you, the event had been listed in that article all year, and only did it become a problem when I tried to add an image on the article recently. I stopped trying to put the image on there, but then they outright deleted the text entry about the event, which I thought was very uncalled for, and utterly ridiculous, considering it was perhaps one of the biggest media events of the year. Perhaps you could help revert this senseless deletion of a notable entry and provide some input on the wiki_link. Thanks for your help!
Regrettably, I feel that this simply demonstrates how inane it is to have articles on years and decades.  I agree with you that it was a noteworthy event, but such things are infinitely subjective, and (I feel) not worth the effort needed to wage the battle.  I would rather be Don Quixote and take on the ''existence of the article wiki_link''.  I mean, what makes ''this'' year particularly noteworthy?  I think that 1989, 1848, and 1776 are all exceptional years, and more worthy of an article than, say, 1922.  We don't provide every author an article just because he wrote a book, and we don't give every American mayor an article, even if he is re-elected three times.  We are supposed to touch upon the ''noteworthy''.  The NIU shooting is more notable than many events in wiki_link, but wiki_link is not worth the time of day to me (at least, not yet.

Greetings.

513868198.3527.3527,"Hello, I have observed that since this century turned, new cars have had headlamp lenses made out of plastic. Before headlamp lenses were made out of thick glass that reminded me of wiki_link cooking vessels intended for use inside an oven. Is it true that it was in fact heat-resistant borosilicate glass? What is the plastic in use nowadays? I suppose it is wiki_link plastic, but is it regular or somehow treated/coated? I would want answers to these questions in the article. Also, were the transition to plastic lenses possible only after halogen lamps became history? I believe that halogen lamps emitted so much heat that polycarbonate would have melted. So, if the transition was only possible because of technological development in lamps, and a consequence of this (better efficiency, less heat), please point it out in the article. Also, I suppose the use of plastic resulted in weight savings, but is there some drawbacks in plastic? I found some info about high heat polycarbonate. [EXTERNA_LINK: http://www.omnexus.com/sds/headlight-appearance-performance/index.aspx]
This  says that US makers started using plastic headlamps in the 1980's to save weight. The polycarbonate plastic is less dense than glass, adn the whole reflector/lens assembly can be made with fewer metal parts, further reducing weight. Google Books says Popular Mechanics was writing about plastic lenss in cars in 1991 (comparing their high replacement cost with the cheap sealed beam bulbs). I don't think old-time glass lenses were anything special but maybe I can find a reference as to the kind of glass used; recall that an old-time ""sealed beam"" used to sell for a coupe of bucks, so I doubt the glass was anything otehr than good old soda-lime ( or maybe with some lead oxide?). So, I don't think it was tied to halogen lamps as much as to the push to save weight in the days of ever-decreasing CAFE standards. Original research: my 1973 Meteor, 1981 K-Car and 1986 VW Jetta all had glass headlamp lenses (and every one of them had a hole in a lens and a burnt bulb as a result), my '94 Passat had plastic (I think...don't recall), and my curent 7-year-old car has plastic lenses, which have yet to develop a hole (but which are getting yellow).",0,0,0,"The conversation primarily involves a user expressing interest in expanding an article with more information about headlamp materials and transitions.

500740708.19926.19926,"What level of ""Proof"" are various editors looking for? In my case, I knew my long deceased grandfather was on the Dawes Rolls taken of the Cherokee in the early 1900s. However, it took almost 40 years (no exaggeration) to find enough ""proof"" to meet BIA standards to get a Certified Degree of Indian Blood (CDIB) card. After that, getting Cherokee Nation citizenship was easy.
Years ago, I recall the State of California telling me I could not claim to be of Cherokee ancestry on official forms because I was not a citizen at the time. That was extremely frustrating. Five years later when I was a citizen, the state no longer had that section on their forms.
I can see omitting people who have made a claim of ancestry, but documentation shows they are not. I have come across many people who ""feel"" they are American Indian, but have no specific details.
Perhaps the editors who wish to delete some questionable people could contact those people directly to see if they want to be on the list; and if so, could they provide some proof of their claim or the basis of their claim. Then the editors could at least have something to go on.
FYI, while the Cherokee Nation has approximately 300,000 enrolled citizens, over 750,000 people self-claimed Cherokee ancestry during the most recent census. Many people are familiar with the part of Cherokee history called the Trail of Tears which moved the Cherokees to Indian Territory (Oklahoma) in the 1830s. However, many Cherokees left our ancestral lands decades before the removal. Many settled in what now is Arkansas and Missouri. After the ""Trail,"" The US government took numerous rolls of tribal members. If you did not live in the ""official"" Cherokee lands in Indian Territory, you were not included in those rolls. All of those Cherokees in Arkansas and Missouri (just to name a few, others went to Mexico/Texas, etc.) were not included in most rolls. Presently, the Cherokee Nation's primary requirement to become a citizen is being able to trace your blood ancestry back to anyone listed as Cherokee on the Dawes rolls. It does not matter what your blood-quantum is, just verifiable Cherokee blood. So, if your full-blooded Cherokee grandfather and your full-blooded Cherokee grandmother were not on the rolls, you will not be able to become a citizen of the Cherokee Nation, even if you are full-blooded Cherokee.
This all just goes to show that ""proof"" can be hard to come by, and varies from person to person.
For disclosure purposes, I am on the list of people being discussed here. Phil Konstantin

They implemented a so-called ""local rule"" for AKB48-related articles that prohibits adding member lists for B-sides into articles about AKB48's singles. It also says to order the remaining list alphabetically and not by teams. IP editors have tried to put the lists back, but they are being reverted. I personally think that the articles are ruined and that the Japanese Wikipedia has became absolutely useless for anyone who wants to browse through AKB48's releases.
The proposal that resulted in the rule had remained practically unnoticed or ignored. I wonder why. There were just 2–3 editors, and they decided everything for everyone. I didn't notice it too.

The official name of the country as per United Nations is ""Former Yugoslavic Republic of Macedonia"".
How can Wikipedia override United Nations' Decisions and Conventions? On which grounds?
This country was recognized as ""Republic of Macedonia"" by GW Bush administration, possibly the worst US President the world has ever known. In my opinion the latter says it all.
Inhabitants of this country don't know what the term ""Macedonia"" means, whereas in Greek,the term Macedons mean either those
who are tall, either those who come from up (the north), this deriving from the root ""mak"" (makrys/macrys meaning long/tall.

3. Rough Tower is actually two towers joined by a platform above the surface and below the surface the two towers form the superstructure of HMS Roughs, a WWII Royal Navy barge sunk on Rough Sands.
4. Rough Tower is not an island but the superstructure of a former Royal Navy boat.

320251126.19814.19814,"Dear Rivertorch,
As a hobby botanist I have a lot of Crocus species in my garden, including several autumn-flowering ones. I have also put several pictures of them on Commons, including one of the rare Crocus matthewii.
The classification proposed by B. Matthew, the guru of crocusses,I have implemented on 14 October 2009, 20:16, although not ideal, is the one which is generally accepted, and books and other websites are referring to it.
I find the changes made by  premature since they are based on recent (March 2009) phylogenic work, which have to be confirmed by ""further studies"" to consider a new hierachical system of classification. Futhermore the changes made by  are not user-friendly (strikethrough words, paragraph in parentheses) and are even source of confusion, because not in full accordance with the text he has added.
As I did in wiki_link I have retained B. Matthew's classification as such. I have added a paragraph with the results of the recent (March 2009) phylogenic work, waiting for the results of ""further studies"" before changing accepted B. Matthew's classification.

Excessive commentary disrupts the flow of the track listing, which should be easily scannable."" (emphasis mine).

If it continues in the vein I have seen, I will likley seek to have you barred from further participation on the article. Here are some notes on things you could do to improve your editing.
1. You need to seek consensus for changes that may be controvercial, as opposed to merely making those changes and hoping that they are either missed or that they are protected by the 1rr probation the article is under. There are a number of ways you could do this - you could propose your changes on the talk page and then wait for many comments, specifically looking for comments from people that have problems with your edits, correcting the problems they have, and then resoliciting their opinion. Another option is to make the changes you would like to the article, but expressly state that any editor may revert them, or that you would revert them on demand.
2. Blogs are never acceptable sources. If the only source you can find for something is a blog, it should never be included in an article. If you are sure something is true - it's not. You need a source for all information you intend to put in the article.
3. You should ""write for the enemy"" - when you are making an edit, be sure you know what the response from people who are traditionally on the other side of the debate from you would think of it, and make specific consessions to what problems you would expect them to have with it.
4. Edit summaries should be accurate. If you are reverting, note that. If you are making multiple changes, don't just mention one change and hope the rest go under the radar.
If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

:I was trying to point out that the Article did not reflect the increasing controversy that this federal education program is gaining in, especially, Bible Belt states.  There are many criticisms of this program aside from educational ones.  There are a number of concerns among Christians that this program not only takes control of local schools' curriculum away from the local school boards and puts it entirely in the US Dept of Education's hands, but that it will also take away parental oversight of children.  For example, there is a concern that a school principal and/or nurse may have the right to send a child to a hospital or doctor w/out the parent's/s' consent.  What if the family happens to be members of the The First Church of Christ, Scientist Small text,and does not believe in treatment by Medical Doctors??? This is just one criticism.

However, he then goes on to show how both Buber and Levinas fall short of patristic thinking on personhood. He clearly sees Levinas as coming closest to the patristic understanding, but he points out how, e.g., Dionysius the Areopagite and St Maximus Confessor are superior to Levinas. The same is true of Macmurray, whom Zizioulas credits as having made an insightful critique of other Western views on personhood; he does not, however, base his own thinking of that of Macmurray. Interacting with non-Orthodox philosophers, and acknowledging what is worthwhile and what is deficient in their thinking when compared to the Church Fathers, is not a reason to criticize Zizioulas.
