[Arsenikk]: Hi. You may have missed it, but I had a follow-up question under the first point at [[Wikipedia:Featured list candidates\/List of Sacramento Regional Transit light rail stations\/archive1]]. <font face=\""serif\"">
[Arsenikk]: Hey! Did you finish fixing up everything at [[Talk:Hobart International Airport\/GA1]]? Nice if you could leave a note there when you're done so I know when to come back and looks things over. <font face=\""serif\"">
[Arsenikk]: Remember that at GA, an article does not need to be longer than what can be found in reliable sources; i.e. if there are no RS around from which to write the history, it cannot be required. On the other hand, news archives (at least online ones) can often provide some RS. For instance, in my recent GA [[V\xe6r\xf8y Airport]] (which was a strip with two daily services) I used a combination of an archaic book from the library about the airline for the pre-airport history, and a closed news search engine (which I only have access to because I'm a university student) to find news reports from back then. Most of the history actually dates from an \""convenient\"" accident report which would close the article. These are some possible RS; there may be others, or there may be very little. In a way, it is often up to the discretion of the author of smaller articles to determine when there is no more to say. <font face=\""serif\"">
[Arsenikk]: Hi. I notice you have spent the morning [at least in my timezone] moving masses of articles, such [[Greece\u2013Norway relations]] to [[Greece \u2013 Norway relations]]. Why? The [[WP:MOS|Manual of Style]] is very clear on this issue: \""Disjunctive en dashes are unspaced, except when there is a space within either one or both of the items ({{xt|the New York&nbsp;\u2013 Sydney flight}}; {{xt|the New Zealand&nbsp;\u2013 South Africa grand final}}; {{xt|June 3, 1888&nbsp;\u2013 August 18, 1940}}, but {{xt|June\u2013August 1940}}).\"" As for instance both 'Norway' and 'Greece' consist of a single world, there is no room for interpretation and the articles should have remaind where they were. I have also failed to find any kind of discussion about the issue before you went around with such a massive move. <font face=\""serif\"">
[Arsenikk]: The MOS says that by default en dashes [in this use] are not spaced. However, if one of the two \""items\"" has two or more words, then the en dash is spaced. For instance, [[Norway \u2013 United States relations]] is correctly spaced, because 'United States' consists of two or more worlds. On the other hand [[Norway\u2013Sweden relations]] is not to have such a space, because both 'Norway' and 'Sweden' only consist of a single word. I would strongly recommend you move back all the moves where both countries are single-worded, and in the future please make sure you understand the naming conventions and Manual of Style before doing massive moves to articles. <font face=\""serif\"">
[Arsenikk]: I notice you reverted [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Vehicle&action=historysubmit&diff=403523377&oldid=403460215 my edits] of [[vehicle]], stating \""restore lost references\"". This is an counterproductive revert. The article is in dire need of a clean-up, for which my edit was a small step. It is hard to me to believe you even looked at my edit, which contains removal of inappropriate legal definitions in a single province (which had a different scope than the article), merging of several small and trivial sections, copyediting, removal of out-of-scope content, formatting, and removal of out-of-scope external links. The one reference that was removed, was done so of a good reason, because a legal definition from that province directly contradicts the definition of a vehicle on Wikipedia. Please be more careful with reverts in the future. Just because references are being removed, does not mean the edits are disruptive. Thank you for your understanding, <font face=\""serif\"">

[Arsenikk]: To follow up on the non-article comments from the Kristins Hall review: I have been doing some work with the [[1994 Winter Olympics]]; the article needs a decent copyedit (I just have to get around to it) and it should slide through GA. At the moment the article has some shortcomings that I am very aware of, and currently there is little use in anyone else fixing much to it. Once past GA, I'll need some help to get it up to FA standards, if you are interested in collaborating about that. I've brought or nominated seven 1994 venues for GA, in addition to having brought [[venues of the 1994 Winter Olympics]] to FL. On slightly more long term plans, I might do the same with the 1952 Games. I tend to switch a bit around topics, right now I'm doing some stuff on football, so I don't know when I'll be back to Olympics articles. <font face=\""serif\"">
[Arsenikk]: Is there anything more to say about [[Superfinalen]]? I was thinking of GA nominating it, but it seems a bit short. On the other hand, I don't know what else to write about it. <font face=\""serif\"">

[Arsenikk]: Details about the ski jump are at [[Holmenkollbakken]] (fully referenced). I find the Olympics article a bit unclear in that the hill had been rebuilt many times between 1892 and 1952, see for instance the difference between [[:File:Holmenkollbakken 1904.jpg|1904]] and [[:File:Holmenkollbakken 1934.jpg|1934]] (both images). In the 1952 article, it gives the impression that the hill had remained constant since 1892, which is not the case. The bit about the wooden superstructure being replaced with concrete is accurate, though, as this was done for the Olympics. <font face=\""serif\"">

[Matt Yeager]: I don't really want to do this, but I'm wondering if you would please reconsider. The \""[[e (number)|e]]\"" issue occured about three months ago. That's what I meant when I said that \""I learned a lot\"" from it; I did learn an awful lot about [[WP:CIVIL]], etc. . I know I DID make mistakes on the page in multiple facets, but I'm wondering if you could point out any time where I really \""lost my head\"". I don't personally believe that I ever acted ''too far'' out of line; I'd really appreciate knowing where I went so wrong (if in fact I did), since once a source emerged for the claim, I did back off. I haven't asked any of the other \""oppose\"" voters to reconsider (though I might), but you seemed to have a very positive opinion of my adminship potential, except for one (admittedly bad) mistake I made. I really do believe that I've learned from that mistake, and hope that you reconsider (though of course I understand why you wouldn't).
[Matt Yeager]: That's one example. I don't have all that many others, because I don't do the \""talk page of contentious article\"" thing so much anymore. That's why, actually, my little musical note redirects to [[Special:Random]]... because that's how I've made so many of my worthwhile edits (like the ones to [[Chris Vance]], [[Dedan Kimathi]], etc... some totally random dudes that I just stumbled across in a state of total disrepair). I've tried to put the encylcopedia first, especially since the '''e''' debacle... I've come to realize that there are vastly more important (and vastly more easily changed) things than one sentence on a certain number's importance. Really, that's the most important thing I've learned from the arguments I've had on Wikipedia, and I hope that the scope of my edits proves how thoroughly I've taken it to heart. If the reasons I've presented seem compelling enough, then I would like to ask you to please change your vote on my RFA. Thanks for listening in any case.

I can't imagine what would be properly named [[Template:Funky]], can you? So, if you don't mind too awful much, I'd really just rather have it be a redirect. You can always nominate it yourself at RFD if it's that big of a deal to you, but I don't think that I'm going to myself. Cheers,
[Matt Yeager]: Actually, scratch that... I just re-created the \""funky\"" template, because I want to have the word \""please\"" in there--just to be politeand all--and other editors are against that.

It's a bad idea to have parenthenses in the name of any article unless they're needed for disambiguation, but there don't seem to be any other Richland High's. Are you about to make a disambiguation page with some names, or did I miss something?
[Matt Yeager]: Oh, I'm not faulting you at all... I'm just worried that we're only just starting to air out our arguments, and suddenly there's this 5-days-left time bomb. And I know it's just an informal survey to see where everyone stands, but I'm concerned we might have people on either side say \""Oh, my side won 8-6, we're totally moving it to Matchbox Twenty (or keeping it at matchbox twenty)\"". But I appreciate the idea, I'd just personally have wanted a bit of a longer wait.

[discospinster]: Now that the external links are removed, it's not an obvious candidate for CSD.  If you feel that the article warrants a discussion deletion, you can nominate it at AfD.  There are quite a few Google results, for what it's worth.  I've put an {{tl|unreferenced}} tag on it and will add it to my watchlist to keep an eye out for spammers. <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: Did you want the talk page redirect to be deleted as well?  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: I have deleted the talk page per your request.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: Hi.  I misread the article and thought that the movie was released on-line, so I deleted it as non-notable web content.  Unfortunately the AfD discussion was under a different name so it wasn't obvious that it really was a G4.  Well, it's deleted anyway and I'll protect it as you suggested.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: Well, glad that's cleared up!  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: I've restored that one version where you took out the copyvio.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: Well, it's been deleted again.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: Unfortunately none of the claims of his death were accompanied by a source, and the vast majority were made by anonymous users, which is why I protected the page under the \""vandalism\"" banner (nothing personal).  If someone can direct me to a reliable source that confirms his death, I will unprotect the page.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: No problems.  If true (which I hope it is not) it will be in the news soon, and then the appropriate changes can be made.  Right now all I can find is an announcement on \""Metal Underground\"" but I can't seem to access the page.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>

[discospinster]: No, it's the post that was made at the same time you were posting your warning (as you can see the time stamps are the same), while I was looking for the article [[Rock nest monster]].  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: Hi, yes that was me who moved the image, and I also made a few minor formatting changes (de-capitalizing headings, removing some bolding where it didn't need to be).  I will have a look at [[CamGSM]].  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: Yes, it's better.  Although I took out the section \""Products & Services\"" because EM7 was already discussed in some detail in the intro, so having another section about it is unnecessary.  If readers want to know more about what it does, they could click the reference link to go to ScienceLogic's webpage.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: The '''CamGSM''' article is much improved; thank you for your work on it.  It still needs some more incoming links, but that's a relatively minor issue.  I've removed most of the maintenance tags.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: As for the corporate logo, the guidelines can be found at [[WP:LOGOS]].  Generally the use of the corporate logo on the Wikipedia page for that corporation would be considered \""fair use\"" under U.S. copyright law, because it's used to illustrate the company.  It must be low resolution so that it would not be useful for any other purpose (i.e. so someone won't want to take it and use it elsewhere).  You wouldn't have to ask permission of the company to do this.  However, when you upload it you have to explain precisely how the use of the image in the article is \""fair use\"".  An example of such an explanation is the [[Apple Inc.]] logo [[:File:Apple-logo.png]].  If you need help with it let me know.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: In order to indicate the significance of a subject, the article must state how the company is notable.  Wikipedia has a certain definition of \""notability\""; the general guidelines can be found at [[WP:N]] and the specific guidelines for companies are at [[WP:CORP]].  You would need to show that the company has received significant coverage in [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] that are [[WP:IND|independent]] of the subject (e.g. newspaper articles or editorial reviews in well-known consumer web pages).  If you'd like to start a draft of an article to work on, you could do it in your userspace, at [[User:Jaydeeself\/My Infant Needs Inc]].  I've moved the original article there.  You should also read the page [[WP:Your first article]]; it will give you some tips on how to write the article.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: I was using templates to format the references.  There is a list of them at [[WP:CT]].  It doesn't matter which order you put in the fields, the template will always format them in a specific order.  I used {{tlx|cite news}} for both, so I'm not sure why they came out slightly different.  For the purpose of the template, Reuters is not considered an author but a news agency, so it would go in the field <code>|agency=<\/code> rather than <code>|author=<\/code>.  Apparently this makes a difference.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: Hi.  I'm not exactly sure what it is you want to do.  Where are you trying to insert this image?  In the [[Stueng Hav District]] article?  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: Hi there.  Yes, it has been much improved by the addition of these [[WP:RS|reliable sources]], you did a good job.  I have recommended to keep the page in the deletion discussion.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: You're quite welcome.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: Well there's not much for me to go on since, as you say, there are no specifics about the accusation.  I see that you left a message for [[User:Urbanrenewal]], and [[User:Sphilbrick]] has also asked for clarification, so hopefully there will be some more information one way or the other.  From a quick look at the original SP investigation I'm not seeing anything that would implicate you, so I don't think you have to worry too much.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: If you are referring to [[Health Fidelity]], it's not currently flagged for deletion.  The previous version was deleted because it did not indicate how the company is notable per [[WP:CORP]].  The current version has a lot of references, but few of them are actually about the company itself.  You need to find and add [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] that directly talk about the company.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: There's nothing in the article that indicates he is well-known.  You need to add [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] that show he meets [[WP:BIO]].  On the [[Talk:John J. Powers (actor, comedian)|article's talk page]] you bring up significant roles in TV or films, a large fan base, and unique contributions in entertainment, but there's no specifics as to what they are.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: Seven days.  An alternative is to move it to your article space (say, at [[User:Jkinzler777\/John J. Powers (actor, comedian)]]) where you can work on it as a [[WP:DRAFT]] until it's ready to go back into article space.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: I've moved it for you since I'm not sure if you're autoconfirmed yet.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: Because you did not supply a source?  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: Yeah, I wasn't sure because the books were written by authors with WP articles, and the notability guidelines for lists tend to be somewhat more relaxed.  But if a broader consensus would help, then I agree it should go to AfD.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: I would suggest that you work on the article in your name space; that way it's not likely to be deleted.  For example, you could start an article [[WP:DRAFT|draft]] at [[User:Nutty48\/The White Cross (Gaming Clan)]], and ask other editors for their opinion at [[WP:FEEDBACK]].  I hope this helps.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: Hi Dan.  I can't delete the image myself, since it's in Wikimedia Commons and I don't have privileges there.  Eventually someone that can delete it will come by and do so.  I'll try nominating it again and we'll see if it makes any difference.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: I think what happened was you (I assume it was you) placed the deletion tag on the page, but since you were editing as an IP and not logged in, you weren't able to create the deletion request page.  The request was thus not technically complete.  I've created the deletion request page so it should proceed normally from there.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: Hi there.  Since you are the only author of the [[Geraldine Jones]] page, you don't have to do anything fancy to merge it.  Just copy the text from the article and paste it in an appropriate place in [[The Flip Wilson Show]] article with an edit summary like ''merging info from <nowiki>[[Geraldine Jones]]<\/nowiki>''.  Then replace the text of the Geraldine Jones article with <code><nowiki>#REDIRECT [[The Flip Wilson Show]]<\/nowiki><\/code>, put in an edit summary like ''info merged; redirecting'' and save it.  Let me know if you have any troubles with it.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: Preferably it would have its own article, but there should at least be a link to a [[WP:RS|reliable source]] discussing the micronation (like a newspaper article, but not the micronation's own web page).  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: I'm not 100% sure myself, but I saw that there are other articles on French schools similarly named ([[List of schools in France]]).  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: Since [[WP:CSD#A7]] does not define \""important\"" or \""significant\"" it is difficult for me to respond to an editor who asks me what it means, since I don't know (other than \""lower standard than notability\"").  Until I can get an idea of what it's referring to I might as well use the term \""notability\"" for articles that are certain to be deleted, since it's the only term that is given any explanation.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: Since it's a contentious issue, I don't want to summarily delete the article.  However, since I can't find any verification either, I've [[WP:PROD|proposed]] that it be deleted.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: It's no trouble; I'm glad you brought it up because I do think there needs to be some kind of guideline as to what \""important or significant\"" means.  It's very vague, so I don't think that helps potential editors either.  I didn't realize it was such an issue for admin candidates.  I probably should spend some time at RFA. :-)  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: It should have been deleted by now.  There might still be something wrong with the nomination, so I've reverted all that and started again.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: I don't think it's ready quite yet.  The language comes across as unencyclopedic and promotional (e.g. ''His comedy is infectious -- you will find it nearly impossible to stop laughing!!'').  Some of the text is copied directly from the PRweb article, which is a violation of copyright.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: Sorry about overwriting the changes you had made.  I had to move the history over but I figured you would go back and make the corrections again. :-)  As for the typo redirect, I have deleted it as an unlikely redirect.  Thanks for letting me know.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: The link from PRWeb is not independent, as it is a press release.  Gig Masters and the New York Hysterical Society are also not independent since he works for them.  The Comedy Point and Funny or Die links only demonstrate that he contributes to those sites, not that he meets one of the points on the list above.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: While all of the above might be true, there needs to be more [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] in the article verifying it.  I did a search for \""Girlsounds\"" and I couldn't really find anything that discussed it as a musical style.  As for the references in the article, two of them just indicate that the records exist, and the other one is unclear (is it a book?).  The maintenance tags are there so that other editors will notice and maybe have a go at adding references and cleaning up the article.  I'm sorry that you feel \""demeaned and abused\"" but this is very much the process that new articles go through, as they are always \""under construction\"".  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: If he did play for Chelsea, then there would be some argument for notability.  But there is nothing that verifies it.  People often try to create articles that are untrue (many times relating to football; I have deleted more than a few of those), and one way to check is to search for references.  If none can be found then it will likely be labelled a hoax.  I will restore it and change the deletion reason.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: You need to be more cynical. :)  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: The [[WP:PAGE|history]] of the article does matter because it shows who has edited it.  If an article is the wrong name, or another name would be better, it could be [[WP:MOVE|moved]] to the new name, which moves all of the history with it.  It is not correct procedure to redirect an existing article just because the name has to change.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: Oh I see.  I knew something was dodgy but I don't have enough experience with Commons to figure it out.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: Hi Douglas.  Please see [[Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials]] for instructions on how to allow the material to be used on Wikipedia (via the terms of the [[WP:CC-BY-SA|CC-BY-SA]] and [[GFDL]]).  Basically you would need to grant Wikipedia permission the text under the CC-BY-SA license, which means that anyone else would be able to use it as long as they attribute Wikipedia and offer it under the same license.  Often it's better to re-write the content in your own words, so that the tone is more [[WP:NPOV|neutral]] and less [[WP:PEACOCK|promotional]]. <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: To become an autoconfirmed user (the minimum for uploading images) you have to have made at least 10 edits to articles.  But I've gone ahead and made you a confirmed user, so you should be able to do it now.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: Hi there.  First of all there is an issue with the article name -- if it's about the Sallie Mae funding change, why should the article be named after one of the schools affected?  It also needs to be written in a more [[WP:NPOV|neutral]] tone, just stating facts and not coming down on one side or the other.  There's not really a need to list the individual schools that closed.  Also, sources should also be [[WP:RS|reliable]], like newspaper articles, and not blogs or discussion forums.  For example, the [[Tech Republic]] and [[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] articles would be reliable sources, but the sallie-mae-warning.blogspot site and \""Sallie Mae - My Story\"" would not be.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>

The definitions of [[socialism]] and [[capitalism]] that are used in wikipedia neither reflect the usage of the terms within the school of economics nor do they accurately describe the countries that are generally considered to be, or define themselves to be, [[socialist]] or [[capitalist]]. Worse yet, the definitions of the terms reflect the usage of the terms by a specific segment of the US population. That is, [[socialism]] is meant to be synonymous with a command economy, or a [[planned economy]], according to the misuse of the terms in wikipedia. And [[capitalism]] is meant to be synonymous with [[laissez-faire]] according to the misuse. For example, the US could not be considered to be capitalist by wikipedia standards, yet is is one of the most market-oriented modern democracies in the existence. In fact, by wikipedia standards, no country could be considered to be capitalist! I have both undergraduate and graduate texts that clarify the misuse of these terms, however a segment of the US population has made it especially difficult to change much of these definitions. This takes away from the more economic approach of defining a free market economy, mixed economy, and command economy as the economies with differing levels of central planning. I know that neither political economy nor economic history is your field, but I was hoping you could give me some advice as to how to properly fix these essential components of the wikipedia project. As is, the economic concepts that the general public uses most often are horribly misused and incorrectly defined in wikipedia. Can you lend some guidance as to how to fix this problem?",Not Admin,0,Not Admin,0,"[{""Suggested_Label"": ""Not Admin"", ""Justification"": ""The editor's comment displays characteristics more aligned with non-admin users.

Ericoides,False,"[Ericoides]: Hi Jim, thanks for the message; yes, it was a bit ambiguous. As was \""Royal Robbins described Frost as one of his heroes in 2002\""! But I changed that too...

See here[http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=List_of_climbers&action=historysubmit&diff=298290868&oldid=298290716]. I wonder why it was scrapped? Great article of yours anyway. Regards,
[Ericoides]: Ah, I see. Thanks for the info. No probs re the edit.
[Ericoides]: Hmm, interesting question. I'm really not sure. It would be good to have a date before it appears on the home page as a DYK. Why not have a go; there wouldn't be a way to reference it tho', but I don't see the harm in that. I can't find a date online, but I haven't looked too hard. From one of the pages linked in your article we know for a fact that he is over 60... (Added later: From this interview[http:\/\/www.climbing.com\/community\/perspective\/tom_frost_the_full_perspective_interview\/index.html] we know he is at least 72, but I'm not sure when the interview took place. Even if I did, the year might be one of two, as it were) But at present the article is like a statue missing a head.
[Ericoides]: If I might make one more remark, good idea for scrapping the infobox. I can't see the point of them for this kind of article. Cheers,
[Ericoides]: Ah. If you look at the infobox in the [[Allen Steck]] article it should be clear. Simply add info to the fields for which you have info. Details here: [[MOS:INFOBOX]].

[Ericoides]: Good work on TF; how nice to hear of someone so reclusive and publicity-shy. Thanks for the [[Mount Garmo|Garmo]] input too.
[Ericoides]: Thanks for your cleanup but now the ''Daily Mail'' reference I added today simply gives \"" .London\"" without the name of the paper in the ref, which cannot be correct. I'd amend it myself but I can't work out how to... Regards,
[Ericoides]: Ta.
[Ericoides]: If I can just chuck in my tuppence worth, you DO need to put the four tildes in your comment above. Happy Xmas!
[Ericoides]: A lifetime working in London's publishing houses and I've never heard that one before (\""British English tends not to use full stops after initials etc\"" \u2013 it seems particularly odd that you should maintain this, having started an article entitled F. G. L. Chester!). In the book world we place a period after letters if the abbreviation fails to end with the final letter of that which is being abbreviated. Hence we put a period after Rev. but not after Revd ... Unless the Hon. E. E. Villiers was actually an Hon (not an Honourable), and unless her two names were E and E (rather than Elizabeth, Emily or what-have-you), we would always style her the Hon. E. E. Villiers. If going with your style I would suggest it might be better to close up the Es so she is EE Villiers (I've done this in the piece). Even then, she should certainly be the Hon. (with, if you'll excuse the expression, a period). I consulted [[Abbreviation#Periods_.28full_stops.29_and_spaces]] and it seems to be fairly accurate, except that it uses newspapers in its examples (FT etc.). When I have time I'll expand it to cover other forms of publishing. I have the feeling that an encyclopedia should be using books rather that newspapers as its stylistic inspiration, would you not agree? Kind regards,
[Ericoides]: Ah, the onscreen experience was not something I had considered, so thanks for pointing that out. You might be right. There is, however, something about T. S. Eliot or E. P. Thompson that seems much (for want of a better word) 'classier' than TS Eliot or EP Thompson, perhaps just the old buffer in me seeing the inexorable creep of txtspk into areas where it has no business being. I can't say I care for the Guardian's style too much (don't mention their spelling), and they do seem to try to be wilfully different for the sake of it (double-quotes, no italics for book titles etc.). 'Periods' I use as it's marginally shorter than full stop, but to be precise I should have written 'full-point'.
[Ericoides]: This is all very interesting, bringing up lots of things I'd never considered (eg the screen issue), so thanks for that. I've often wondered why people used that &nb thingy rather than a straightforward en-rule (as here \u2013). Re your point concerning 'this is the way British usage is generally moving', I genuinely think that it moves because people in positions of publishing power \u2013 eg editors \u2013 let it do so, and so it behoves us \u2013 as editors \u2013 to make sure it goes where we want it to go. We are not entirely passive (this is very much the case in book publishing, where if I want something to be styled in such-and-such a way I can ensure it is, thereby creating or perpetuating a style that others might cite as a norm). OK, back to work, nice to chat.
[Ericoides]: Equally, 'furthest' is quite acceptable in [[Lenzspitze]] and all the other UK-related pages or pages where UK spelling was used from the outset that you have changed. Given the two comments above, please check UK usage and be careful re these changes to so many articles, it's a lot of work to tidy up (Cassell English Dict. \""furthest\"" a. most remote in time or place; Oxford Concise Dict. \""furthest\"" a & adv (used as superl. of FAR) 1. a. Most distant; etc). Regards,
[Ericoides]: Thanks for your message. What you say might be true for US English \u2013 indeed it's an interesting and useful distinction; sadly that is not the issue here. Re your comment about the restricted use of further\/furthest as \""Further means \""more far\/distant\"" figuratively or non-physically\"", in UK English you'll notice that the OED and the Cassell dictionary disagree with you (\""most remote in time or place\"" and \""Most distant\"" (OED gives for \""further\"" To or at more advanced point in space or time \u2013 from this one can infer that space is certainly relevant to furthest). Please give me a reference from a dictionary of UK English that supports your point. Until then please do not keep changing articles in UK English to what you mistakenly believe to be correct usage. Kind regards,
[Ericoides]: Your work on spelling is truly amazing, but may I ask you again to respect UK spelling. In [[Chessington World of Adventures]] you changed speciality to specialty. In UK English (which should be used here, as the park is in the UK) speciality is the correct word. Perhaps you might internalise [[American_and_British_English_spelling_differences|this list]] (speciality is even listed there as the correct UK spelling) and any further lists that give more examples!

[Ericoides]: Hi Wereon, thanks for your message. You say that \""it does officially have a comma\"", but looking at an official source such as www.parliament.co.uk (ie Hansard) I find that you seem to be mistaken. See these refs[http:\/\/www.parliament.uk\/search\/results\/?q=Sheffield+Hallam] [http:\/\/www.parliament.uk\/search\/results\/?q=Plymouth+Sutton+and+Devonport]. Equally, are you saying that in calling the constituency Sheffield Hallam that the Sheffield City Council is incorrect? See [http:\/\/www.sheffield.gov.uk\/your-city-council\/elections\/election-results\/general-election-2010]. These sources seem to be as official as you can get. Moreover, I am intrigued why you haven't changed the name of the [[Plymouth Sutton and Devonport]] article itself. Regards,
[Ericoides]: Thanks for that. It looks like a lot of pages need their names changing then! (Just noticed you are at Cuths. Small world; so was I (1982\u201385)).

[Ericoides]: Hi Jim, Just wondering whether you might have any info on [[James Eccles]], about whom I've just started a page. He seems to have done a fair bit in the Rockies. I don't have any books on US mountaineering, whilst I imagine that you have quite a few. Any new info gratefully received. Best wishes,
[Ericoides]: Many thanks for that wealth of info, invaluable. I'll try and fit it into the article. Regards,
[Ericoides]: Re Eckenstein, I think there's something in a Winthrop Young biography I have, as well as a Younghusband biog. Plus a passage in Eric Newby's ''A Short Walk in the Hindu Kush'' (about the Eckenstein boulder in Snowdonia). I'll have a rummage tomorrow, it's late now. Crowley biogs have more, of course.
[Ericoides]: Many of my books are still in storage but I found this (btw, JP means [[justice of the peace]]). \""Early in 1907 Geoffrey was voted on the committee of the [[Climbers' Club]], the club for Snowdonia climbers, and immediately he was in action. His Journal notes: \""Made a brilliant (!) speech at their dinner, with [[Sir Charles Trevelyan, 3rd Baronet|Charles Trevelyan]] and [[Francis Acland]] as my guests, who also spoke. Helped to settle the Eckenstein-Abraham row over the Abrahams' North Wales book.\"" Oscar Eckenstein was an impressive but odd man, one of the very few who could get along with \""the great beast\"", Aleister Crowley. A railway engineer by profession, he was a veteran climber with an original and inventive mind, a pioneer of balance climbing and a pioneer, too, of the use of crampons on snow and ice. Like many of the Snowdonia climbers, he hated publicity, believing that their sport should remain private and exclusive. The [[George and Ashley Abraham|Abraham brothers]] of [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]], George and Ashley, had grown up in a very different tradition. They were professional photographers and took the view of their [[Lake District]] mentor, [[O. G. Jones]], that climbing was such fun that everybody should be told about it and encouraged to have a go. In 1906 the brothers published a book, ''Rock Climbing in North Wales'', crammed with accounts of adventures on the cliffs of Snowdonia and illustrated by their superb photographs. This would have been enough to upset Eckenstein but, compounding the offence, one passage in the book, [94] about an early attempt on the [[Y Garn (Glyderau)|Devil's Kitchen]], vividly described his assault on the crux wall and \""pricipitate retreat\"". An incensed Eckenstein introduced a resolution at the Club's annual meeting, the exact terms of which have not been recorded. The tenor, however, is obvious. Ashley Abraham stood up to plead that he and his brother had intended no personal offence. Eckenstein was finally persuaded to withdraw his resolution.\"" Hankinson, Alan (1995). ''Geoffrey Winthrop Young: Poet, Educator, Mountaineer'', Hodder & Stoughton, 1995, pp. 93\u20134. In a later passage in the same book, Eleanor Slingsby (daughter of [[William Cecil Slingsby|Cecil Slingsby]]), gives this brief portrait of OE. \""I remember Eckenstein very well at the 1911 party, hammering things in the hall and smoking his awful pipe tobacco. He had a bushy beard at that time and was regarded as something of a prophet figure.\"" (p. 119) On p. 233 Hankinson notes that OE, together with [[John Percy Farrar|Farrar]] and [[Norman Collie|Collie]], had helped GWY with his book ''Mountain Craft''. If you have the time\/energy you could also trawl through some of [http:\/\/www.ukclimbing.com\/forums\/info\/search.php?forum=0&dates=1&name=&topic=&body=Eckenstein these threads] on UKC (eg the one entitled \""Who was the Brit mountaineer?\"").
[Ericoides]: Your work on OE is excellent, well done. If you have the time you could give more details on the OE-Abraham feud (the GWY above) after the sentence \""though their relationship was not always smooth\"". For instance, \""though their relationship was not always smooth, as may be in seen in the Eckenstein-Abraham row. This was caused by the publication of the Abrahams' North Wales guide in which Eckenstein was ... etc etc.\""; always nice to have specifics. This would then lead nicely into the North Wales material that follows. I'm afraid I don't know much about that period of the AC, although I know Whymper had trouble with the AC because he was considered a \""swell\"" (a [[Class (social)|class]] distinction, I think). There is an excellent collection of essays called ''Mirrors in the Cliffs'' (ed Perrin) which, among many other good things, describes this period; many decades later, as the [[Edward Lisle Strutt]] article says, \""... 1927\u201337, these being the years \u2013 according to Alan Hankinson \u2013 in which 'the Alpine Club [...] had declined into a stuffy, snobbish, backward-looking institution. Its dominant figure was Colonel E. L. Strutt [...] for many years the autocratic and outspoken editor of the Alpine Journal. His views were rigid and intolerant. The only decent and honourable way to climb was the way in which he had climbed as a young man. Crampons were inadmissible; pitons anathema.\""
[Ericoides]: Yes, you might be right. Perhaps he asked for a [[U and non-U English|serviette]] rather than a napkin. Most of what I know about California comes either from the Grateful Dead or ''Curb Your Enthusiasm''. The only time I visited I was 6 years old.
[Ericoides]: I'm guessing you ''must'' be in [[Dushanbe]].
[Ericoides]: Thanks Hro\xf0ulf. Gresham's eh, what a coincidence!
[Ericoides]: I'm not sure if this has already been raised at DYK in the past few days as I haven't visited it but I've put on a query on the article's [[Talk:Robert_Parker_Les_sept_p\xeach\xe9s_capiteux|talk page]]. Nice article, btw.
[Ericoides]: I've changed it now to ''Robert Parker: Les Sept P\xeach\xe9s capiteux'' so it corresponds completely with the book's cover. (It always seems to me that French use of upper-case in titles is rather haphazard, but the cover should always be followed ...)
[Ericoides]: Unless I'm misunderstanding you, have a look at the title as presented on the book's cover. Two fonts (hence, partly, colon). Then, in that extravagant script (the subtitle (hence again, partly, colon)), upper-case L, S and P and lower-case c (i.e. ''Les Sept P\xeach\xe9s capiteux''). That, aside from the imprint page, is the best authority we have for the correct spelling of the title.
[Ericoides]: Lovely article, congratulations.
[Ericoides]: Lovely article, congratulations.
[Ericoides]: No problem. I used to live in Sofia in the early 1970s (on Marshal Tolbukhin, if you know it) and your articles bring back some very happy memories.

[Ericoides]: Nice article.
[Ericoides]: As you were the creator of these pages I thought I should say that I've moved [[British Mount Everest Expedition 1922]] to [[1922 British Mount Everest Expedition]] and likewise with the 1924 one so that, eg, [[Portal:Mountains\/Alpine_history]] has a consistent list, with event following date (eg [[2008 K2 disaster]]). Unlike my misguided Base Camp suggestion above, I think this one works and I hope it's OK with you. Regards,
[Ericoides]: Hi Lihaas, I'm not sure what you are trying to say with this phrase: \""as well as a revolt from southern secessionists (where Osama Bin Laden is originally from[7])\"". How can he be \""from\"" southern secessionists? People are \""from\"" places. I am \""from\"" England, and he is \""from\"" Riyadh. If you are trying to say something different (I'm guessing you want to say that ObL's [[Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden|father]] is Yemeni, which is not the same as saying that ObL is from Yemen), please say so clearly and in English, rather than reverting perfectly reasonable changes. Thanks,
[Ericoides]: Fair enough. It was not stated clearly, that's all.
[Ericoides]: How you've rephrased it is perfect :).
[Ericoides]: I am not really sure what I think. I drafted this: Weak support for rename to Category:People educated at X. This is the clearest method. It's a great shame to ditch the idiosyncratic and charming Old Wykehamist etc, but I do like a bit of internal consistency in my categories (eg, see [[:Category:Deaths in sport]] for an awful mess). Makes them easier to work with. 'Alumni' for 'school pupils' is quite horrid and should be avoided at all costs. (Some hours later, I was disturbed to find [http:\/\/wyksoc.com\/ this].) Thanks for notifying me, tho'.
[Ericoides]: Hi Larry. Sorry, my point about the \""ridiculous title\"" referred to that unwieldly and very American construction, \""William R. Kenan, Jr., Professor of Sociology\"" at the University of Virginia. I should have been more clear. We surely don't need to say \""University Professor\"" (should be lower-case, in any case), as that is implied by the Wazza R. Kenan stuff. As an aside, I remember ''Prophesy and Progress'' very well as an undergraduate in the early 1980s, and I still have two copies, one my own, the other the library's that I carelessly forgot to return. Regards,
[Ericoides]: Ah. In which case you are right. Another US-ism, so I'll revise what I said above, and say that \""ridiculous\"" now covers both designations. I'll leave it to you whether or not it's reinstated, but personally I'd leave it out. It's no great potatoes either way.
[Ericoides]: Hi Jim, axes aside, I've just seen your comment on [[Talk:Thomas Graham Brown]]. Yes, you are correct. I've just acquired a copy of ''Brenva'' so I'll be greatly expanding the article in the next few weeks. But see my rather weary comment on the Talk page. Regards,
[Ericoides]: I've made a few minor changes to Wright, mostly closing up the refs to the text immediately preceding them. Bit busy at the moment with work but will have a better look on Wednesday. Looking good, though.
[Ericoides]: The blog that quotes the paper is not a reliable source, so we cannot trust what it claims the ''Sunday Times'' says.
[Ericoides]: Hi Epeefleche, Just wondering \u2013 if you've any spare time \u2013 if you'd have a look at [[Ntrepid]] to see whether anything can be added etc. I'd like to take it to DYK but it's a bit on the short side; there's not much info on this shadowy organisation. Thanks,
[Ericoides]: Sorry, I was pushed for time.
[Ericoides]: Please don't change hooks just because you are unfamiliar with the rules of English grammar. As someone has rightly pointed out, \""its\"" is just as correct as \""it\"". Many thanks,
[Ericoides]: Hi Benea, Sorry about my move of that sub. I realised right after I'd done it that it was a mistake but although I tried I couldn't revert my move. Thanks for doing it.
[Ericoides]: Sorry about this. It was not mean; the diff shows that his contribution was pretty much nonsensical and was so badly written that it couldn't stand as it was. I explained this on his user page; but in future I will not tamper with his credits. I've emailed you in any case.

Mike Rosoft,True,"[Mike Rosoft]: Sincerely,
[Mike Rosoft]: In fact, PipeDown is not the only user to add the material to the [[Mark Barry]] article. I have removed it from the article's history to [[Mark Barry\/hoax]]. -
[Mike Rosoft]: I'd say: no, there is no evidence that the edits have any merit. There are essentially two versions of the article: one of them is a valid stub about the musician, the other a long, barely coherent piece claiming that he was a football hooligan (probable hoax), inserted in place of the real article. -
[Mike Rosoft]: Thanks for your considerations, but \""XYZ is [position]\"" is consistently used in every Wikipedia article about people holding a particular position at the moment (see [[incumbent]] and [[Lists of office-holders]]). Or is there a consensus to change that? -
[Mike Rosoft]: If you believe the article [[Moldova]] should be moved, please list it at [[WP:RM|requested moves]]. Thank you. -
[Mike Rosoft]: The contents you have added is completely unformatted, and I am not sure that it's even encyclopedic (I guess the other editors will decide it; I have listed it at [[WP:CU]]). Please see [[Wikipedia:How to edit a page]] and [[Wikipedia:Manual of style]] for instructions on proper layout of an article. Regards,
[Mike Rosoft]: [[WP:CU]] is just a shortcut for [[Wikipedia:Cleanup]], a listing of pages in need of edits. Nothing will get fixed automatically, but chance is that another user will have a look at it. Personally, I am not even sure where to start; a part of the problem is that lines starting with a space will be displayed as unformatted, fixed-with font text. By the way, where did you get the text? Did you write it yourself, or did you happen to take it from the school website or another outside source? The latter case would be a problem, since you can't use copyrighted material on Wikipedia without a permission of the copyright holder. (See [[Wikipedia:Copyrights]] for details.) -
[Mike Rosoft]: I have attempted to clean up the format of the article; it will probably need to be radically trimmed (and rewritten into prose, not just lists). The copyright will probably note pose a problem, since a mere listing of facts can't be copyrighted. -
[Mike Rosoft]: Well, it's better than it was (at least, it's readable). It probably still needs some work, but it's not somehing I can help you with, so I'll leave it to others. -
[Mike Rosoft]: I apologize if I was too harsh to you in your self-nomination. If you want to know, I don't approve of Israli actions in Palestinian conflict; to the contrary, if I lived in Israel, I would probably be a member of the organization [[Gush Shalom]], or perhaps in jail for refusal to serve in the military. But the point is that Wikipedia has a policy of [[WP:NPOV|neutrality]], and it's not supposed to be [[WP:NOT|a soapbox]]. Regards,
[Mike Rosoft]: You have nominated several templates created by {{User|Sgeo}} for speedy deletion for misrepresenting the policy; I don't see how they meet the criterion, so I have moved them to his user space. Regards,
[Mike Rosoft]: I strongly recommend you to withdraw tour nomination for [[WP:ADMIN|adminship]], as it's <b>highly<\/b> premature. You have made very few edits, almost all of them to your user space. You should try again several months from now, after you have some experience with constructive editing of articles and the [[WP:5P|Wikipedia policies and guidelines]]. Regards,
[Mike Rosoft]: In the end, I have removed the speedy deletion notice from the article, as it makes a claim of notability per [[WP:MUSIC]] - two albums at a somewhat notable label. I recognize that the article has been speedily deleted several times, so if you believe it isn't notable enough, feel free to nominate the page for [[WP:VFD|deletion]]. -
[Mike Rosoft]: Could you please be more specific on what page\/user you talk about? -
[Mike Rosoft]: Simply said, because the article wasn't encyclopedic or even factual. If you want to create a page about your friend (or yourself), get a personal website or a blog. ([[WP:NOT|Wikipedia is not a hosting service]].) -
[Mike Rosoft]: It's not just that the article is unreferenced, but I wasn't able to find any evidence that the sitcom even exists. -
[Mike Rosoft]: Maybe, but I wanted to give it a benefit of doubt. Perhaps {{tl|hoax}}? -
[Mike Rosoft]: The page was originally marked for speedy deletion as [[WP:CSD#G12|copyright violation]]. Instead, I deleted it under a different criterion - as [[WP:CSD#G11|promotional]]. (Given that you are affiliated with the organization, you should have a look at the [[WP:COI|conflict of interest]] guidelines. Generally, it is recommended for users not to create articles about themselves, their companies, etc.) In addition, the name of your account seems to imply that it is a shared corporate account; since an account is only to be used by a single person, I would recommend for you to [[WP:CHU|request its renaming]], or simply create another one. (See the [[WP:UN|user name and user account policy]].) -
[Mike Rosoft]: After reviewing the article and some research using Google, I believe that the game probably is notable enough to have an article on Wikipedia. (On the other hand, [[WP:OTHERSTUFF|existence of other articles about less notable subjects]] isn't a very strong argument for keeping this one; each article must stand or fall on its own.) -
[Mike Rosoft]: That's right, but as far as I can see all edits by unregistered users are of this kind. In fact, the last vandalism has remained on this page for months. That's why I had semiprotected the page. -
[Mike Rosoft]: I don't think that [[WP:OTHERSTUFF]] contradicts community consensus; to the contrary, it repeatedly gets referenced in deletion debates. Granted, results of previous debates may be used as a rough guideline on whether or not to keep a different one (though it is in no way binding; [[WP:CCC|consensus can change]]). Mere existence of another article can't; just as well it can be a reason to nominate the other page for deletion as well. -
[Mike Rosoft]: Because [[East Jerusalem]] is a geographic term with a specific meaning (unlike \""southeast Jerusalem\""). -
[Mike Rosoft]: Read the article [[East Jerusalem]]. -
[Mike Rosoft]: Granted, but there's no point in creating redirects from all-caps titles. (Page titles are case-sensitive.) -
[Mike Rosoft]: \""Southeast Jerusalem\"" means \""South-eastern part of Jerusalem proper\"". \""Southern East Jerusalem\"" means \""Southern part of East Jerusalem [Israeli-annexed area]\"". Har Homa is in the latter, not in the former. -
[Mike Rosoft]: [[Manchester, NH]]? Sure. In fact, it already exists. -
[Mike Rosoft]: For the second time, Har Homa is NOT in southeast Jerusalem [proper], it's in southern East Jerusalem. I consider this point closed; if you want to continue it further, take it to the [[Talk:Har Homa|article talk page]] or [[WP:EA|editor assistance]]. -
[Mike Rosoft]: Granted, the page ([[Filter Platforms Inc.]]) wasn't particularly promotional in nature; on the other hand, it didn't cite any third-party references and only referenced the company's websites. The primary [[WP:CORP|inclusion (notability) criterion]] is: did the subject attract non-trivial coverage in reliable third-party sources? I am afraid the company doesn't seem to meet these guidelines; articles that don't contain any claim of notability or significance may be [[WP:CSD#A7|speedily deleted]] upon discovery by any administrator.<p>If you believe that the article could be salvaged, I might restore it into your user subpage for you to work on. You can also seek advice at [[WP:EA|editor assistance]]. -
[Mike Rosoft]: There is (namely, [[Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations|CheckUser]]), but I suspect it has already been run. (The edits have been so thoroughly redacted that not even [[WP:ADMIN|administrators]] can view them; only a handful of users have such a privilege. If you want to be sure, feel free to contact the [[WP:ARBCOM|Arbitration Committee]].) -
[Mike Rosoft]: I have made a checkuser request at [[Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations]]. -
[Mike Rosoft]: Don't know; you can try contacting the [[WP:ARBCOM|Arbcom]] by e-mail. (There's already an [[WP:ANI#Oversight please|Administrators' noticeboard]] thread.) -
[Mike Rosoft]: The BJAODN has been removed from Wikipedia, but it has found a new home at [http:\/\/bjaodn.org\/ bjaodn.org]. -
[Mike Rosoft]: I have reviewed both the deleted article [[The Real JO]] and the links you had given me, and I found nothing that would persuade me that you are in any way notable. The main notability (inclusion) criterion is: did the subject of the article attract non-trivial coverage in reliable third-party sources? (See also the [[WP:MUSIC|specific notability guidelines for musicians]].) [[WP:NOT|Wikipedia is meant to be an encyclopedia]], which is a compendium of existing knowledge, not a means of making something known.<p>In fact, it is recommended that users do not create articles about themselves; see the [[WP:COI|conflict of interest]] guidelines for more details. -
[Mike Rosoft]: I would recommend contacting [[User talk:King of Hearts|King of Hearts]], who closed the deletion debate. -
[Mike Rosoft]: I am of the opinion that it's redundant to existing articles - [[House of Stuart]] and articles about individual monarchs. Since you have challenged the [[WP:CSD#A10|deletion]], I have brought it to a full deletion debate at [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\/The later stuarts]]. -
[Mike Rosoft]: The article [[DJ stellth]] doesn't cite any [[WP:V|third-party references]] and fails the [[WP:MUSIC|notability (inclusion) guidelines]] - in fact, coverage in reliable third-party sources is the primary notability criterion. In general, a user should not create articles about himself or other topics he is directly connected with; see the [[WP:COI|conflict of interest]] guidelines. ([[WP:NOT|Wikipedia is meant to be an encyclopedia]], which is a compendium of existing knowledge, not a means of [[WP:SPAM|making something known]].) -
[Mike Rosoft]: The main [[WP:CORP|notability (inclusion) guideline]] is the coverage of the company in reliable third-party sources. Your article cited none; instead, it was filled with marketing language. In general, it is recommended that users don't create articles about themselves, their companies, or similar topics they are directly connected with; see the [[WP:COI|conflict of interest guideline]] for more details. -
[Mike Rosoft]: Once again, see above. Is the video notable for anything but being the longest video on YouTube? Do you have any reliable third-party sources that mention the video? If not, then I am afraid Wikipedia won't have an article about it; it's that simple. (See the [[WP:WEB|notability guidelines for web content]].) If you believe that the page indeed meets the inclusion guidelines, consider creating it as a subpage of your user space, e.g. [[User:IksDe\/Origami Box Destroy]], and then seek advice on the [[WP:EA|editor assistance page]]. -
[Mike Rosoft]: As a follow-up, the video doesn't seem to have attracted any coverage in reliable third-party sources. It has been mentioned in the YouTube wiki, and on several blogs etc. - these aren't [[WP:RS|reliable sources]]. -
[Mike Rosoft]: It doesn't matter. The videos [[Charlie Bit My Finger]] and [[Me at the zoo]] did attract third-party coverage, and so they meet the notability guidelines. Origami Box Destroy didn't, so it doesn't. -
[Mike Rosoft]: I have reviewed the article, and it seems that the website has only attracted trivial third-party coverage (see the [[WP:WEB|notability guidelines]] for web content). If you believe otherwise, you can challenge the deletion at [[WP:VFU|deletion review]]. -
[Mike Rosoft]: I tend to agree that the article doesn't quite fit the speedy deletion criteria, so I have undeleted it and sent it to a full [[WP:VFD|deletion debate]] at [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\/Cayole]]. -
[Mike Rosoft]: Wikipedia is not [[Urban Dictionary]], or any dictionary at all. [[WP:NOT|It's an encyclopedia]]. If you can provide a verifiable citation for the term's useage, it could be placed in the Wiktionar. If it's a made-up term, then it has no place either in Wikipedia or Wiktionary. See [[:wikt:Wiktionary:Criteria for inclusion]] and [[:wikt:Wiktionary:What Wiktionary is not]]. -
[Mike Rosoft]: It's not quite kosher to create an article with a \""good article\"" tag in place and claim that two unrelated people marked it as such, is it? (See more about the [[WP:GA|good articles]] process.) That said, I have left a bit of feedback on the article [[Talk:Six Million Crucifixions|talk page]]. -
[Mike Rosoft]: Thanks for the reminder; I have marked the article for insufficient notability, instead. (This automated message does sound condescending a bit, though, especially considering that I have been using Wikipedia longer than you. :-) -
[Mike Rosoft]: {{-)}} -
[Mike Rosoft]: No offense taken :-). -
[Mike Rosoft]: If you believe that the information could have better references, why don't you improve them yourself? Alternately, discuss the changes you intend to make on the article talk page, or ask for help at [[WP:EA|editor assistance]]. -
[Mike Rosoft]: I thought that the article was an attack on an existing wrestling organization. I was wrong; hence, I shouldn't have deleted the article as an attack page, but rather under the [[WP:CSD#A7|speedy deletion criterion A7]] - lack of any claim of significance or notability. See the [[WP:NOTE|notability (inclusion) guidelines]]. -
[Mike Rosoft]: I have deleted the article under the [[WP:CSD#A7|speedy deletion criteria]] for a lack of any claim of [[WP:NOTE|notability]]; coverage in reliable third-party sources is the primary notability criterion. ([[WP:NOT|Wikipedia is meant to be an encyclopedia]], which is a compendium of exsting knowledge, not a means of making something known.) -
[Mike Rosoft]: I have restored the article and moved it to [[User:Geofferybard\/Monastic silence]]. That said, I believe that its topic is so close to the topic of the article [[Vow of silence]] that the information could be included in the page itself. (And the page [[Vow of silence]] has itself been nominated for merging to the main article [[Silence]].) By the way, a YouTube video is not a good reference; see the guideline on [[WP:RS|what constitutes a reliable source]].<p>If you disagree with my evaluation of the article, you can seek advice at [[WP:EA|editor assistance]]. (Should you move the article back to article space, I don't want to be revert warring, either; I'd probably seek advice in the same place.) -
[Mike Rosoft]: Yeah; I have reported the bug at [[Wikipedia:Huggle\/Feedback]]. -
[Mike Rosoft]: Normally, [[WP:HUG|Huggle]] doesn't revert anything on its own - it was probably a mistake on my part. -
[Mike Rosoft]: I would ask {{user|HJ Mitchell}}, who recently unprotected the page with a reasoning that \""somebody wants to do something legit with it\"". I don't think this is what happened - it was immediately created as a Wikipedia self-reference. I count the recent redirecting of the page to [[wiki markup]]\/[[hyperlink]] as another Wikipedia self-reference, so I have deleted it and restored the full protection. -
[Mike Rosoft]: Possibly; it depends on how much of a deletionist the reviewing admin is. (It looks like I was wrong on this article; the author just misspelled Nitte Trust as Net Trust. On the other hand, given the user name of the author, the page could be speedily deleted as [[WP:CSD#G11|self-promotion]].) -
[Mike Rosoft]: Looks like this is not the case. I proposed the page for deletion (\""Not written in encyclopedic style, no third-party references\"") while [[User:Nikthestoned|Nikthestoned]] nominated it for speedy deletion ({{tl|db-promo}} - under which the page was eventually deleted). For some reason, the system didn't report an edit conflict, so I just re-added the speedy deletion notice. -

I was acting in goodwill as proposed by [[User:Kmccoy|kmccoy]]'s mediation, by substituting the compromise (temp) version of the article for the disputed one. All previously disputed parts were reworded and entered into that version before to encyclopedia standard. Sam insists on reinserting the same disputed sections plus adding another section into the article without any discussion on the issue! So far he even deleted the compromised part of the article and replaced it with his own. I believe that is unfair to me and all the other editors who were involved in the dispute with him and clearly this shows that he does not want to solve disputes on the article. Please review edit history to see the additional sections that he added and the prior discussions on the talk page. If you do choose to protect this article, I sincerely hope that you will delete the three disputed sections so that it is protected without what all the editors (beside Sam) consider to be irrelevant and disputed. Btw, I was originally there to mediate too, but this issue has escalated with Sam's countless arbitrary decisions.  Please see talk page.Thank you. --

[Anonymous editor]: Absolutely. I agree to edit wikipedia space more often. Please take time to consider your vote if possible. You don't seem like an unreasonable editor, and yes I have made my share of mistakes, but it will take me some time as an admin to familiarize with some of the admin tasks. Thank you. --

[Anonymous editor]: Also I removed the story before because I think we should give other stories a chance too. That story is going to be updated frequently by every incident that happens but that doesn't mean we have to keep giving it special treatment over the other stories like ones where many people have died which are also updated. However I did keep it after the update about the five dead. Thanks --

[Canada Hky]: Found an additional reference for the Globe and Mail story.  I left the original reference in there as well.
[Canada Hky]: I was going to post this on the talk page for the article, and I guess it could eventually get moved over there - what is the reasoning behind having the Midget AAA championships on the SJHL team page for years that the SJHL team wasn't in existence?  Notre Dame had and has a Midget AAA team that runs exclusive of the SJHL team.  If the team wasn't playing in the SJHL, they weren't an SJHL team, and if they were playing in a Midget AAA league, they weren't a junior team (which is what that article is about).  Properly, shouldn't the succession boxes for those Telus Cup wins be on the school page (or whereever the boxes for the other championships are)?  The SJHL players didn't port over to the midget team, it would be like any other team that ceased to exist in a league for a while.
[Canada Hky]: That kind of makes sense.  I see them as two different entities as well.  I'll see what I can dig up on it around here, I'm sure I've seen their history books in a library in the city.  To me - the same players don't mean its the same team.  It just means they moved up a level, but the Midget team can't be the Jr team (if anything, they probably did it because they could no longer be a Midget team as guys were aging out).

I don't entirely believe that but I got that feeling again when she immediately wrote to me that I was somehow biased and practically just made my day miserable by starting this whole fight again... I am agreeing on some of her changes like removing the comparison about DJMax and other rhythm game which I kept just because I found it interesting while it maybe wasn't really important for the whole picture. Mostly Bread Ninja just removes content and doesn't add anything new on her own to replace or improve the quality of available information. Anyway so I asked for a third party opinion and she gave your talk page as a link to me. For a final thing... I really hope that this is not too much of a trouble. I know this is big and complicated matter which went silent for a few weeks but now is starting to heat again. I hope you can help building these DJMax articles with us since it's now being proven that two people might not be able to solve issues they have together and need a third wheel so that things can progress forward. I am probably just like her. Our will is to improve Wikipedia and articles but our views for doing so conflict too much. Which is sad since if we could work as a pair, we probably would be unbeatable pair in writing interesting articles. PS. This was a reconstruction of my previous comment which my Macintosh ate by making a kernel panic twice. ;_; I apologize for it's possible lack of linear path of thoughts. --
[Mikitei]: Let me also add that most things are negotiable with me. If there's a good reason for removing the photo and people (more than 3) support that action then I can perfectly accept that it just won't be there. But as the things stand I still don't understand why Bread Ninja doesn't want that picture there. What harm does it do? What kind of misinformation it spreads? And in generally what is her problem? (Among the other things and issues.) I so much would like to work with her and I don't see any better showcase of that than those long messages I've sent to her, trying to understand her and hers point of view. I am waiting for your reply. Thanks! :) --
[Mikitei]: Please help me and her. Now she just edited my comments (by adding bold) to give different message. I reverted that and then she reverted it and I had to revert it again. Why can't she just make a quote? Why she often splits lists into smaller pieces and makes her own comments on top of them giving readers false assumption that she wrote them? I have to then practically move them into one group so that things aren't mixed. It alone shows that she doesn't know any proper netiquette. At least in my honest opinion. By the way, is there a problem in my written english language? I admit that I am not a native speaker. Usually I have no problems with talking and communicating with people using english but trying to communicate with her has made me doubt myself quite a bit more than once. :\/ --
[Mikitei]: Yeah, that's enough Jinnai. I trust you... And I understand that point about CEs (\/ LEs) you wrote about. I earlier wrote something similar to Bread Ninja also but she misinterpreted it. If it was just an alternative cover, there'd probably be no point having picture of it. I also wrote something on a similar lines that it is not \""absolutely necessary\"" because it's not important news picture about major event for example. But like in the case of that Lunar game it still has a small valuable reason for being here. And I really do plan to improve the article and improve information about LE box. Black Square's LE box has lots of various stuff packed into it ([http:\/\/www.play-asia.com\/paOS-01-77-3-49-en-85-1-70-36dp.html see here] and [http:\/\/www.play-asia.com\/paOS-01-77-3-49-en-85-1-70-36dp.html here]).

And I can guarantee that once I get the box I'll add free image I've taken myself of it and its content into Wikipedia to replace that image if nothing else emerges. The problems with LE are for example that there's no free image available of it and it's contents. Only free image is the image in question. Of course I could just try to ask people on the net for a free picture which shows the contents. For example [http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/25686043@N03\/3173167232\/in\/photostream\/ here] and [http:\/\/www.protocolsnow.com\/wp-content\/images\/tinypic\/081231_djmax2.jpg here] are two promising pictures but permission for their usage should be asked first. Current picture is better than no picture at all. It shows the size and look of the box. Of course the LE box itself is pretty unique and only comparable thing which comes to my mind is \""[[Nokia N900]] Hackerbox edition\"" which had shiny black box you had to \""[http:\/\/vimeo.com\/8259713 hack]\"" open before you as a selected member of the press got access to it. (Hackerbox was only available to press members and few selected hackers if I remember correctly.) Without a picture of LE I think DJMax Black Square article would be less informative and less interesting article to read. That picture has also been a long time there. Numerous people have been editing the article but Bread Ninja is the first one to object having that picture there. Koreans have the same picture in same connection in their article too. Shouldn't the usage be justified since it adds clear value (albeit not much, until better image arrives) to the article and is not against Wikipedia guidelines on the matter... As for the information about the box... Most DJMax sources are in korean. I don't see it as a problem but apparently it's huge problem for Bread Ninja. Of course trying to verify something without knowing korean is hard then but since services like Google Translate do exist which can give rough image of the content in korean text for english speakers it shouldn't be too big of a problem. Wikipedia IRC channel thought that it's acceptable in most situations when there's no english language sources available which all take priority over everything else. Of course only then (like it stands in [[WP:NOENG]])... And I'll add that this is first time Bread Ninja writes that she got IRC working. It's not a problem of accepting something or not but a problem of understanding what she actually wants to say and how she understands my messages. Her actions are also sometimes completely opposite of what she says. But there's probably no point if we tell you about these things since we are both no good for it. --
[Mikitei]: Just what is going on in her mind? I don't want to offend anyone but this is just absurd. She's like poison to my motivation. I hope we can talk this thing through and resolve this dispute in a civil manner. --
[Mikitei]: I almost forgot to show these sites... It's easy to find these two blog posts about DJMAX Black Square. Both are about \""unboxing\"" DJMAX Black Square Limited Edition... [http:\/\/www.protocolsnow.com\/2008\/12\/31\/dj-max-portable-black-square-limited-edition-dj-max-technica-ultimate-collection\/] and here [http:\/\/koiaichaku.com\/?p=1517]. Sorry about this really fast and bit messy reply. --
[Mikitei]: I know that it doesn't matter what kind of picture it is, you practically always need a permission from its owner \/ person who shot it. There are some cases which might maybe allow free use but studying if it falls there is more complicated than just asking for direct permission. I am sending emails asking from bloggers if they are willing to contribute a picture to Wikipedia. So far many haven't answered and one has refused to give a permission. At the moment I am going through the korean websites and stuff. I find it disappointing that game's official website won't mention the Limited Edition. It's however quickly mentioned few times in developer blogs. But there's nothing worth adding to wikipedia to support the case. For example somewhere they mentioned that \""LE's content has been set few days ago\"". They had this kind of small mentions but I might have missed something. It apparently was more huge deal to developers that \""Clazziquai Edition\"" had been leaked to web before official release and they almost cancelled whole \""Black Square\"" because of that if I understood the text correctly. It was something they had many times in their blogs... Since my knowledge of korean language is very very limited it might take a while I go through korean web sites. I hope you won't get impatient with me. Especially because I don't have that much free time from projects I am working on in university. And I need to rest sometimes too. :) --
[Mikitei]: I strongly disagree. --
[Mikitei]: I am at the moment whenever I have time I am searching stuff like [http:\/\/ruliweb.daum.net\/data\/preview\/read.htm?num=640 this] from the web. In that link developers are being interviewed about Black Square and how they came up with the idea of releasing two titles one for casual and one for hardcore gamers and various other stuff. I know at the moment why the special edition is cube. But I am still searching for better sources for it. There's this guy whom wrote that limited edition's name Quattro means four in italy. Which I checked hold true. It was chosen since the Black Square is the fourth title in the portable series. Limited Edition is cube because of this square analogy, see [http:\/\/blog.lhyeung.net\/lang\/en-uk\/2008\/12\/06\/dj-max-portable-black-square-quattra-limited-edition\/#more-3811 here]. There where only 1500 copies of Black Square Limited Edition (not 1000 like I previously stated) and it's definitely a limited number unlike what Bread Ninja wrote. She didn't obviously understand that there are two editions of the game... normal and this limited edition. Black Square Limited Edition has a ridiculous price point of costing you more than 200\u20ac these days despite the fact that it was released only few years ago (that means price has got a lot higher from 50\u20ac something.). Its a real collector's item. --
[Mikitei]: I've been trying to explain why it's needed and you don't understand my view point. Besides I will talk this over with Jinnai and after that it will be still there, will be replaced, or removed. Or something else will be done to that picture. Please wait. --
[Mikitei]: I really think you should let me and Jinnai talk this out. If Jinnai is clearly on behalf of the removal the it's ok. At the moment, Jinnai has this 50-50 feeling about the matter, staying neutral on the subject. You think that picture should be removed and I think that it should stay there as it is. This is not a consensus as I can see it. You're not even giving me time to search for this stuff. Besides you still haven't answered what kind of negative effect the picture has on the contents of the article. It's only adding value in various forms to the article. Why it should be removed? I would understand your point if the picture had no relation to the contents, would be bad quality, had license issues or something like that. But there's none as far as I know. Of course it would be much better if contents would be shown. But until I get the Limited Edition package or somebody gives permission for a that kind of picture its not going to happen. Can you at least await for Jinnai to actually make a reply on this subject. One other thing I don't like about your change by the way is that you're destroying the list of limited edition contents. That list is easy to read. I guess it's a matter of taste (just like this picture conflict between you and me is) but I think that you're lowering the readability of the article by making a long sentence out of things inside the package. You might as well just remove the whole Limited Edition section if you're doing that. However if you do it I will revert that change since I oppose such actions. Why don't you do something constructive for a change and actually try to write something? Good night! --
[Mikitei]: [[User:Jinnai|Jinnai]], temporarily taking the picture out from the article doesn't sound that bad indeed. However what I am most concerned is that the picture might be removed during that period it is not being used. Can you assure it won't be removed from Commons? I know it probably won't be soon but the possibility is there. Also at which point should we make a deal about bringing the picture back? How much information should be added until it could be added there? I know that if we make a deal about the bringing the picture back at later when certain information or conditions have been met for it... And if I or somebody else meets those requirements we negotiated for bringing it back... Can you assure that it won't start another fight? I think that it's more than likely that for example Bread Ninja probably would not honor that agreement and would probably start saying things like \""it was already discussed and decision was final\"" or \""you're still not meeting the requirements we made a deal about\"". Besides if there's a value (albeit small) that picture adds and it doesn't conflict with policies of Wikipedia why it cannot stay there? Probably easies solution to meet expectations of everyones would be that the current picture is replaced by image which shows the content of the box. Right? ...Hey! I tried to add more text to go with the picture on the [[DJMax Portable Black Square]] page and I hope that you can check it out. Korean gaming sites give small pieces of information I've tried to translate those sentences into a english. It's bit hard to make it quality text because I need to translate korean to finnish and then translate it from finnish to english inside my head. I'll give my reply to Bread Ninja later on... hmm... what else? I just quickly builded [[DJMax Mobile]] article and I was hoping somebody could inspect it. Could you do it? Thanks! Now I'll go to sleep. It's so wrong and immature to stay awake till 4am fighting in Wikipedia about a single picture so often. :) --
[Mikitei]: I have university to attend to and I am not able to do this stuff right now. I got permission for a new better picture which shows the box contents but before the owner changes flickr copyright to CC I pretty much cannot add it. Anyway looks like Bread Ninja acted on her own once again... What should I do with her? I will revert the change she just did and then correct her spelling later on. It's really annoying that she uses word \""consensus\"" when only consensus we have here is pretty much only her own. Besides I would need to do this for 24\/7 to get everything there and I just don't have that kind of time to give for Wikipedia. --
[Mikitei]: And your opinion Bread Ninja is different and you can have different opinion but you don't have authority to decide it alone whenever the image is indeed unnesseary or not and right to remove it just because you think it's \""trial\"" information. That would not be the kind of democracy I expect from Wikipedia users. It would be helpful (and much appriciated) if more opinions are collected about this matter. --
[Mikitei]: Why don't you read your own text? You're not getting what I am saying at all and you're just not even trying to reach agreement here other than what are in alignment with your own goals. And consensus isn't consensus until parties (all three of us) agree to it. And it has not happened if you read the text here. And so far we all have our own opinions about the matter. Besides you're accusing me of something I am not. You're not neutral here. Get more people to back up your opinion. Get more people to talk about this thing at all. You're not building things. And you're not the one whom should be deciding what information goes in and what goes out. Section name should be specific in this case because there's only two releases, normal and limited edition. If there where more than two special packages and both where listed there I could agree with you on more general naming. Other than that it's just distraction and making article hard to read and understand. You where fine with the Black Square article being what it was for years. Why don't me and other people improve it? Please read the conversation... Jinnai has not written the words you wrote in change log of Black Square. --
[Mikitei]: There are people whom find small details interesting and there are people whom don't find them interesting. I guess it's up to us as contributors to determine which details should be in the article. For example, if something was sold in a some price and currently that something has a value which is a lot higher than what it was originally sold, don't you want to know what the original price was? I'd find that interesting information. Besides how you can see that as a something which moves the article out side the neutral point of view? Trivial information would be something like telling \""black square has a song something where a something in a some corner is seen doing something at point something\"" and so on. I would remove that kind of trivial information. Every article on wikipedia is built on top of small but important details (some more than others). If you're only writing about the video game as a what kind of game it is from gamers perspective then you're missing the neutral point. In a way just in a same sentence both denied and admitted that you support removing of the information... I think that your perspective is highly one sided considering what the matter is just as much you think mine is. This probably calls for a more opinions about the matter. I hope Jinnai can come up with clear answer. I'm off to read for swedish exam... Good night! --
[Mikitei]: Bread Ninja, I can say those same words back to you. You don't seem to have neutral view on the subject and you just remove what you feel like instead of thinking if its needed or not. That's why you're promoting censorship. --
[Mikitei]: I am taking Wikipedia's side as well here. Problem is that Wikipedia doesn't define good or bad in cases like these. We can both happily work for the Wikipedia and still have a completely different point of views. Both of us have one goal in mind. Improving the articles. What is different is our methods. --
[Mikitei]: I want you to know that I probably won't be able to come to Wikipedia for the rest of the week. I am having really busy time now in real life. --
[Mikitei]: Also Bread Ninja, when article is short stub there isn't nothing to clean. First somebody builds a rough version of the article and then community starts thinking what is really important and what isn't. If you start cleaning the article while somebody is building it you're just going to ruin his\/her motivation for building articles in the first place. Please keep that in mind. --
[Mikitei]: Jinnai, can you explain to me where we are right now? What is going on in this topic? What is going to happen with the picture? Bread Ninja is bringing here stuff that I don't feel belongs to this subject anymore and I am not sure if she even has a goal she wants to meet. I think she doesn't understand the point here at all and does what she pleases. I have a long reply (actually two) for her which mostly just consists of lecturing her on philosophical subjects related to this matter which I feel is pretty far off of the actual point... actual point being about \""what is going to happen to that image?\"". I don't feel like submitting that reply. Most importantly I feel that the image has its place and it's right at home where it is currently. It has a job and it does it. Albeit it could do it better. By the end of the month or early next month I can probably take a picture of the limited edition package with its contents laid before it and upload it to commons to replace the current image which just shows the box. And that's just maybe since the limited edition is really rare. If I do that is it ok solution for Bread Ninja who obviously want the current image out of there? It's hard to get anything concrete out of her. Jinnai, you've seen what kind of english she writes and I just cannot take her seriously anymore. My objective here is to have at least one DJMAX article which has a single picture to show what kind of limited editions DJMAX series has. I feel that it's worth a picture. Not every DJMAX article needs it. Just one article is fine. Something you can refer to in a main [[DJMax]] article. Since Bread Ninja is not doing article writing (= work towards the goal of improving it) I feel that this is getting pointless. If she really was doing something to improve the article up to next class she would start contributing stuff instead of just ruining the articles with her low class copyediting. --
[Mikitei]: I have few more paragraphs about these things you've written in this thread I feel I haven't really given my reply. Like I wrote to Jinnai, I don't feel like submitting them all since they are off-topic replies to your off-topic sentences. I wrote them so that you would understand my view point better to this subject but I don't know if I should even try showing them for more than a few reasons. :) --
[Mikitei]: You can believe what ever you want but I am adding the image just because article calls for it. I am arguing here that you're removing it because you're not rational on this topic. Oh by the way, what about the random picture about game boxes the [[Halo (series)]] article has? Halo (series) article generally has pictures you probably would seem unworthy but it's still a \""good\"" quality article. I see a contradiction here between you and others in a articles like those which have bit similar conditions and still have just accepted the image despite what you deem as a absolute direction. --
[Mikitei]: Bread Ninja, More importantly I haven't touched your comments like you can see here: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Jinnai&oldid=423815720, That is your edit and your comment. I don't know why you started editing your own comments and then starting to accuse me of editing your comments. Please keep that out of this debate. That's really dirty of you. --
[Mikitei]: Are you aware Bread Ninja, that you generally don't organize your replies properly? Because of you there was few times when Jinnai didn't even noticed the message I left for him. I think so because no reply written for me in this thread albeit I can see from the logs that Jinnai was active during that time and wrote a reply to you. You wrote so much that comprehending everything is difficult and replying to you often requires even longer reply message. I just feel bad for the sake of Jinnai. --
[Mikitei]: I strongly disagree with your first paragraph but anyway... About second paragraph: OK. Until then... However I promise that I'll change the picture to something better soon. I'll show the picture first to you before doing any changes. --",Not Admin,0,Not Admin,0,"[{""Suggested_Label"": ""Not Admin"", ""Justification"": ""The editor, Mikitei, demonstrates a communication style that lacks the authoritative and directive tone typically associated with administrators.

I didn't decide to go on wikibreak, I just had more pressing concerns, and it didn't seem to matter so much to me.

Too many people who would otherwise be building the encyclopedia are having their time wasted by disruptive editors. Some things will have to change with this project if good editors are to be retained. But, well, we'll just have to see if that improves.

[Kathryn_NicDhàna]: A note on my comment about the need for POV and accuracy flags on the article, or at least on the last version I saw of it. I think it is important that the article's name accurately reflect its focus. My concern with the article is that a Wiccan\/Graves\/Modern-Feminist-Spirituality interpretation has been misrepresented as *the* \""Neopagan\"" perspective. Neopaganism is diverse, and only some faiths pay any attention to the Maiden-Mother-Crone thing. My concern with the article all along is that it should not imply that all Pagans, Heathens, or Neopagans see \""triple Goddess\"" as meaning Graves' modern Maiden-Mother-Crone configuration. I've seen too many shoddy, Newage and Neopagan writers abuse this theory and try to shove Goddesses like Brighid, An Mhorr\xedghan, and various other historical Goddesses into that ill-fitting format. It's a format that is irrelevant to many traditional cultures. So I think we need to be very careful to not make it sound like \""Neopagan\"" = Wicca. In my low level participation there in the past, I tried to make this clear, but Davemon made it a [[WP:BATTLE]]ground environment, and I just don't care enough about the article to fight with him. This is how editor after editor has been discouraged from working on the article. I don't think Davemon understands the field well enough to make some of these calls. Or if he does, he just doesn't care. - <font face=\""Georgia\"">

The purpose of me being here is to see if you would be so kind as to provide me with the definition of \u201cspoil the kitten-eating monsters\u201d. Look, some people say that I usually take things very offensively, and yes, that is true. So am I missing what you're saying, or what? If you are indeed trying to piss me off, then please read [[Wikipedia:No personal attacks]], one of the basic pillars of Wikipedia. Also, please [http:\/\/meta.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/Don%27t_be_a_dick don't be a dick]. I really don't see why you are trying to play this strange \u201cgame\u201d. I would like to request your point of view: when you were typing the comment, how did you think I would react? Were you suprised when I reacted? Or is this a joke? Or do you just personally hate me? If your anger is on my user signature, then please [[Wikipedia:Forgive and forget|forgive and forget]], as I have shrinked my username to normal size. It is still a work-in-progress. Honestly, if you're still mad, just [[Wikipedia:Get over it|get over it]]. Look, I'm sorry if I pissed you off in any way at any point it time, but you're just going to have to [[Wikipedia:Accepting other users|accept it]]. Anyway: please be so kind as to bring me an explanation as to why you won't tell me what \u201cspoil the kitten-eating monsters\u201d is? I apperciate all the trouble you have been through, and I thank you for any and all help.

Ckatz,True,"[Ckatz]: Good point - take a look now. I've updated the link list at the top of the article. --
[Ckatz]: I think you two have worked out a good solution to the \""city conundrum\"". Thanks for resolving this issue. --
[Ckatz]: Cool... thanks for doing that. I've checked out the page before and had planned to apply to use it. No time like the present, eh? --
[Ckatz]: Wow, looks good. You put a lot of work into it, and it shows. Some problems, though - one, we lose the diagonals, which is a fair bit of information. Two, the arrow icons invite people to click on them, which leads to the image page. This will (I think) be somewhat confusing for most readers, so you might want to consider using arrows from a character set (as opposed to Wiki images). --
[Ckatz]: Hey, forgot to leave you a note re: the latest update. Take a look at your sandbox when you get a chance, and let me know what you think. --
[Ckatz]: I liken it to the directions assigned to highways - a \""north\"" route doesn't always head exactly north, but it's the best approximation of which way you'll be travelling. Food for thought, so let's keep this discussion going. --
[Ckatz]: Very kind - it's important to try and get your ideas in there too. The part that I'm least keen on is having multiple entries for the '''same''' municipality (i.e. (SW)Vancouver - (S)Vancouver - (SE)Vancouver). If we can address that issue, I wouldn't be so bothered by having, say, Surrey and Delta in the same cell. On the subject of the empty spaces (which I think can be a good feature if used appropriately), what do you think of the idea of using some colour-coding? I was thinking that we could colour the backgrounds of the individual cells with a very light green or blue (for land or water) to visually tie the cells together. I'll be playing around with the coding later tonight ([[User:Ckatz\/Workspace\/Templates|here]]) so if you have suggestions please leave a note - colour ideas, styles, \""No, Ckatz, the idea isn't worth the paper it's printed on\""... (OK, maybe not the last one!) Cheers! --
[Ckatz]: I might ask you what your reason is for persisting in this, frankly, rather pathetic edit war. You've already been [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:ED209&oldid=64965708 taken to task by an admin] for ignoring established Wiki procedure, and it was quite a scolding at that. [[User:Pm shef|Pm shef]] obviously has an agenda too, he really should clearly state his personal and professional connections to the Vaughan political process, and he's certainly not without fault in this matter. '''However''', and this is an important point, he at least appears to be doing something on Wikipedia '''other than arguing endlessly about a municipal election.''' I mean, really, get a life already. This is an encyclopedia project with a global audience. '''Absolutely no-one''' in their right mind cares about this, '''unless''' they're from Vaughan. (I'd wager that there are probably a lot of Vaughan residents who would cringe if they knew what sort of presence their (town?city?district?) now has on the Web.) To be perfectly honest, I didn't even know where Vaughan was before I happened to stumble across this dispute, and after watching it for quite some time, I'm even less impressed. If you want to add a controversial point, take it to the talk page and hammer out a compromise. If you aren't satisfied with the results, then there are other avenues to explore in terms of expanding input into a difference of opinion. Why this article exists is beyond me -- it would make more sense to just Afd the thing and hope it goes away. --
[Ckatz]: Thanks for catching that - I only intended to remove the \""social fabric\"" and \""lifestyle\"" edits, and retain the burner info. --'''
[Ckatz]: No, what I wanted to do was remove the text about grow-ops and the homeless, pending verification, since they are two of the topics that tend to get thrown into articles by issue-driven contributors. The burners, however, are not a \""controversial\"" subject, so, while I couldn't personally verify their existence within the stated timeframe, it did not seem outside the realm of possibility. I thought I'd ask, however, as there are a few editors frequenting the Vancouver project who seem to have a really good knowledge of BC's history. Thanks again. --'''
[Ckatz]: Some of your changes had to be reverted since they were contrary to the WP:MOS for disambiguation pages. I've left a full explanation at [[Talk:Eris#Re: Nfitz's edits|Talk:Eris]]. Cheers! --'''
[Ckatz]: I'm sorry, but I have no idea which index you're referring to - you are editing from what must be a changing IP address, so I can't trace your edit history to establish where we crossed paths. However, if you could please provide some more details, I would be happy to discuss it further.  (As an aside, you might wish to consider establishing a user name, as that would give you a stable talk page and allow you to receive notification about new messages and changes to pages you are following.) --'''
[Ckatz]: I'll check them out. Thanks. --'''
[Ckatz]: Nbound - just to let you know that I've removed the \""Brisbane\"" entry from the price table. I've nothing against Brisbane in particular, but the table should only have one entry per nation or it will quickly become unmanageable. If you prefer Brisbane to Sidney, I'll swap it around. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: I agree - it would be nice to see a range, as there's often a disparity in pricing across nations. (It's certainly that way in Canada!) As I mentioned, adding new rows to the table is problematic, as the size will quickly become unmanageable. However, perhaps the solution is to have one row per nation with a range incorporated into the price (such as \""$1.00-$1.50\/liter\""). Thoughts? --'''
[Ckatz]: I appreciate your concern. However, it is important to remember that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia project, not a PR website. The information about Huang Biren's year of birth is a matter of public record, and it is certainly appropriate to a biographical article about her. There is no rational reason for removing the birth year. --'''
[Ckatz]: It's important to note that I never accused you of vandalism or malicious behaviour; in fact, I recognized your intent. However, the manner in which you approached the cleanup was not the best way to do it. Instead of just deleting numerous discussions and replacing them ('''repeatedly''') with the same warning message, you should have created a proper page archive. --'''
[Ckatz]: No apologies needed - it's all about learning here. I'd offer tips on how to archive, but I've never actually done one myself. If I get a chance, I'll try to read up on it and help out. Cheers! --'''
[Ckatz]: Your reasoning, while valid in some situations, is not required here. We are talking about a reference to a handful of cities, all of which are listed by name only. They can easily be listed in a sentence (as I did), which improves the layout of the page. Otherwise, we are left with large areas of blank space, and an overly long page, for no particular reason. As to your second point, [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Ckatz&diff=82975433&oldid=82556129 now deleted], it would be helpful if you could demonstrate some maturity and stop making spiteful, baseless accusations.  As I told you before, I have no idea what your dispute with Mr. Fenton is, nor do I care. I only asked that you demonstrate restraint by refraining from continuously sniping at him on the Jericho pages. I do not appreciate you then accusing me of blindly supporting him just because I edited your text. Finally, if you are discussing a matter relating to the Jericho article, please keep the conversation on that talk page. --'''
[Ckatz]: This refers to the [[Battlestar Pegasus]] article, where [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Battlestar_Pegasus&diff=86013535&oldid=85989939 you deleted] the text:<blockquote>''\""Glen Larsen, producer of Battlestar Galactica, attempted a revival in the late 1990s with a feature film project using Commander Cain and the Battlestar Pegasus.\""''<\/blockquote> and left the [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Battlestar_Pegasus&action=history edit summary] ''\""Uncited and liekly fan cruft so exterminate.\""'' It took all of ten seconds for me to do a quick Google search and confirm the information. All I'm asking is that you take the time to check out plausible information, rather than just deleting it and leaving a sarcastic comment. --'''
[Ckatz]: Well, I never said you didn't have the \""right\"" to do it - I merely asked if you could be a bit more polite about the way you go about doing it. If you wish to think of this as a \""job\"", then you might also want to consider that labelling your edit with ''\""Uncited and liekly fan cruft so exterminate\""'' isn't particularly professional. The possibility of a film involving the BSG universe is a noteworthy addition to an article about BSG, so you could easily have added a \""citation\"" tag and waited a few days to see if anyone responded. --'''
[Ckatz]: Matthew, it wasn't exactly \""discussed\"" - you said ''\""Removed the ship table as we dont know much about the XCV and also the Starfleets are diffrent, so.. dont add it back thank you.\""'' and deleted it. Also, it doesn't matter if another ship named \""Enterprise\"" turns up someday; we have to act based on what we know '''now'''. The template is for moving between articles about ships named \""Enterprise\"", not for establishing an absolute record of said ships. --'''
[Ckatz]: No problem - I've forgotten before, and I always appreciated it when someone did the same for me. --'''
[Ckatz]: You're welcome! I appreciate the note, and the BSG information as well. Cheers! --'''
[Ckatz]: No problem whatsoever, and no apologies needed - I presumed it was due to the edit overlap. As for MARTA, thanks for the information. Cheers! --'''
[Ckatz]: It's part of the [[Wikipedia:Accessibility|Wikipedia accessibility guidelines]] ([[WP:WAI]]), and the specific section is [[Wikipedia:Accessibility#|here]]:<blockquote>''\""Disambiguation links should be the first elements of the page, before any image or infobox. A text only browser or screen reader present the page sequentially, and otherwise the dablink will be read between the image and the lead section.\""''<\/blockquote> It's a common mistake, as many editors move the top-of-page templates for esthetic purposes. However, it creates problems for people who use screen readers. Hope this helps. --'''
[Ckatz]: Based on activity, I guess. I monitor several hundred different articles that I've worked on, for changes and vandalism, as well as doing the odd bit of vandal patrol work. When an editor's actions warrant it, I'll leave a warning on their talk page (which is how I crossed paths with this editor) and the Wiki software automatically adds that talk page to my watchlist. After allowing time for them to reply,  I remove the page (otherwise my watchlist gets way, way too bulky and s-l-o-w). However, if there's an apparent pattern, I'll keep an eye out for a while - which led to a note on Sw's page today, hence (I presume) the question. As far as I know, the Wiki software won't allow you to check out other watchlists, for privacy reasons. (Perhaps administrators can, but I don't know as I'm not an admin.) Hope this helps! --'''
[Ckatz]: Based on the Wikipedia articles about the [[United Soccer Leagues]] and [[Major League Soccer]], it would appear that the USL '''is''' the largest '''system''', as it encompasses three men's divisions, a women's league, and a youth league, whereas the MSL is a single league with 13 teams. The MSL is the top-'''level''' division, and perhaps that is what you were referring to. However, the text in the lead would need to be rewritten to reflect that fact. I've started a discussion at the [[Talk: Vancouver Whitecaps#Size of league|Whitecaps talk page]] to figure out how best to handle this. (BTW, it's not really \""common knowledge\"" unless you actually follow soccer.) --'''
[Ckatz]: Sorry you feel that way about bilingualism - perhaps it might help if you didn't view it as \""us versus them\"". Frankly, I think it makes the country that much more interesting. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hmm... you're right, that does need a tweak. The coding is a little different than what I'm used to, so I'll try to read up on it and see if it can be adjusted. Nice job, once again, for reformatting and creating the new look. --'''
[Ckatz]: Mike, your links are to a commercial site that is contrary to Wikipedia's [[WP:EL|guidelines]] for external links. As such, they are being removed - not just by me, but by a host of other editors. You are compounding the problem by spamming them across a series of pages, and repeatedly re-adding them. Please read [[WP:EL]] to better understand why your links are not suitable. Thank you - remember that you are always welcome to contribute to Wikipedia, as long as you follow the project guidelines. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Please do not make [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Ckatz&diff=95677975&oldid=95655411 empty threats] in an attempt to justify your [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Stanley_Park&diff=95677414&oldid=95674071 actions] at [[Stanley Park]]. If you had read the edit history first, you would be aware that your material duplicated text that was already in the article, and more appropriately placed. Furthermore, if you had investigated, you would have seen that I made an effort to incorporate your material into the existing text. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, you [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Stanley_Park&diff=95677414&oldid=95674071 blindly reverted] back to your last edit, completely ignoring the fact that you [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Stanley_Park&diff=95677414&oldid=95674071 obliterated a lot of work by several other editors]. Please use more caution, and consider discussing your concerns on the talk page first. Thank you. --'''
[Ckatz]: No problem... I wasn't either, until a template I created was modified. Of course, it being a user box, you're always welcome to propose a change if you prefer a different style. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: No problem at all - just had to ensure that some of the templates didn't persist, such as the Vandalproof software tag etc. Enjoy. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the note. As for the Antarctic 'claim\"", there's no mention of it at the [https:\/\/www.cia.gov\/cia\/publications\/factbook\/geos\/ay.html CIA World Factbook] or the [http:\/\/www.asoc.org\/general\/ats.htm Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition] websites, no results for a Google search (news and web), or on some other Antartica pages I looked at. Wikipedia requires solid references for text, and in the absence of that, we've no choice but to remove the text about the supposed \""stateless person\"" territorial claim. --'''
[Ckatz]: I wil certainly participate in an RfM, if need be, but be advised that I do not take kindly to your actions in this matter. Without any pause for discussion whatsoever, you jumped into the fray and began leaving \""WARNING\"" messages on my page and on those of other users. This is not the appropriate manner in which to achieve consensus, and I think that an RfM would indeed highlight that fact. --'''
[Ckatz]: Ummm... I think that you're looking at TWO sentences. If you'd like to critique, by all means go ahead - but I want to double-check to see if you've misread this particular example. --'''
[Ckatz]: Again, your first reaction is to toss around accusations. If you wish to claim that I am \""vandalizing\"", please provide concrete examples. If not, then don't make insinuations that are groundless. --'''
[Ckatz]: Your \""comments\"" involved adding one word - [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Talk:List_of_Heroes_graphic_novels&diff=prev&oldid=100280967 \""Nazis\""] - to a discussion. Prior to that, another editor had to revert you at [[Torchwood]] for adding [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Torchwood&diff=prev&oldid=100232639 \""Chief of Stupidity\""]. Those were your only two edits that day, so it was clear that you weren't serious about making positive contributions. --'''
[Ckatz]: It's not a question of your intent, it's whether it is appropriate for a discussion on an '''article''''s talk page. In this case, it wasn't, and so it was removed. To be honest, if I hadn't done it, someone else would have, possibly going a step farther and adding a warning note. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... no problem replying here. As for the return to \""is\"", it's based on parts of the style guide, examples of other articles, and related discussions. I'll give you what links I can off the top of my head, and try to add to the list as I find more examples. (Unfortunately, there's nothing concrete in the Style Guide that spells out a guideline, as I discovered while trying to find an answer to a related topic a few months back.) Generally speaking, writing about fiction is to be done in what the MoS calls the \""[[Wikipedia:Guide to writing better articles#Check your fiction|perpetual present tense]]\"". Beyond that, an unwritten but oft-repeated  convention seems to be that a work of fiction '''still exists''', regardless of whether or not it is out of production. That is to say, [[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]] still \""is\"" a film, [[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]  and [[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]] still \""are\"" television series; and [[Calvin and Hobbes]] and [[Peanuts]] still \""are\"" comics. They don't cease to '''be''' films, TV shows, or comics just because there is no new product. However, we would then switch to past tense to describe the production dates (i.e. ''\""Peanuts '''is''' a syndicated daily and Sunday comic strip written and illustrated by Charles M. Schulz, which '''ran''' from 2 October 1950, to 13 February 2000...\""''). Here's a [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Television#Was vs. Is|related discussion]] at the Television project. I tend to agree with the idea of \""is\"", despite the potential for grammatical clunkiness, but either way I'd like to see some sort of guideline emerge as it would help a lot in clarifying one aspect of the project's style. Please let me know what you think of this, and I can incorporate it into some sort of push for a discussion about establishing a guideline. Thanks. --'''
[Ckatz]: No subterfuge intended, of course - I didn't hear back from you, so I presumed you weren't too bothered by the page. Anyway, I'll try to look through it once again to see if there's anything that can be tweaked. Thoughts? --'''
[Ckatz]: If you review the edit history at both [[Runaway production]] and [[Hollywood North]], you'll see that I'm not just \""blatantly reverting\"" you - I am making a concerted effort to incorporate your points into the text. However, that does not extend to just leaving every single word you wrote intact, as much of your material requires a major overhaul to suit an encyclopedia article. Examples include:<blockquote>''though proclaiming that unilaterally in an effort to promote his city doesn't make it true''<\/blockquote> and <blockquote>''\""Hollywood North\"" is not clearly understood as to what exactly it is; but it is clearly not to be confused with the actual cities or long-time film communities of [[Hollywood, California]] or [[North Hollywood, California]]. \""Hollywood North\"" the [[protologism]] does own its name however, to [[Hollywood, California]], the most notable [[film]] centre in the world.''<\/blockquote>The goal is to provide a \""neutral\"" article - that means that any inaccuracies on the Canadian side should be corrected, but it also means that you can't just rewrite the text to push the American industry point of view. It is also appropriate to discuss major overhauls of an article on the talk page '''first''', especially when there is an ongoing dispute over content. --'''
[Ckatz]: And - once again - I would ask that you avoid making misleading accusations about anyone who disagrees with you. In this case, your messages imply that \""I\"" have threatened to have you banned, or that I have put graffiti and threats on your talk page, and several other comments. I HAVE DONE NO SUCH THING, and any examination of the history of our interactions will reveal just that. (In fact, I have NEVER left a message on your talk page. Why? Becuase you tend to delete comments from it, so it is easier and more reliable to interact with you on the article talk page.) Please be civil, at least. --'''
[Ckatz]: I swapped in \""notable\"", but it didn't read quite right in this context - so I've removed it altogether. What do you think of \""pioneering\""? --'''
[Ckatz]: Agent86: Thanks for the note. Whichever template you think is more appropriate, please go ahead and apply it. The \""POV\"" tag is there only because it's what was on the page last night; I didn't do anything more than a straight revert. I'm hoping (hoping hoping hoping) that with a lot of patience, I can get some sort of compromise to work, both at \""Runaway\"" and at \""Hollywood North\"". Both are (IMHO) valid topics, and both article could also use some fleshing out. HN needs to be more than just a definition - it could benefit from a bit of history and industry reaction so that it doesn't get tagged as a \""yay us\"" piece. \""Runaway\"" could use some input from the \""other side\"" - what other nations think about incentives, and why they use them. It could also use some exploration of the other reasons for productions leaving Hollywood - it's not all about cost, as there are issues such as location burnout that factor into it as well. Anyway, sorry to talk your ear off - but you're an interested party who'se not caught up in the [[maelstrom]] yet... Thanks again. --'''
[Ckatz]: Again, check the show's page at CBS.com. That is the list of characters - 12 in total, not including any of the ones you added. The fact that you created an article about a character on a TV show does not make him or her a \""main\"" character, it just means that there is an article. You can still link to your article from the entry in the \""minor\"" characters section. --'''
[Ckatz]: Once again, it does not matter if you, or I, or a TV reviewer, or anyone else thinks a particular role is \""important\"". The show's producers and the network decide who the \""stars\"" are, and who gets promoted as such, in conjunction with union agreements. The Jericho \""Wiki\"" is not the same as the official site, and - even if it was - the deputies are listed under \""supporting characters\"". I could write an article about the guy who died from radiation poisoning (just as you did for the two deputies) but it still wouldn't make him a main character. I'm going to restore the list to what it should be based on the official CBS website, as your own examples prove that the changes you've made do not reflect the actual character list. Please take your concerns to the article talk page if you wish to seek a change, rather than just changing the article over and over again. Thanks. --'''
[Ckatz]: On a related note, thank you both for your participation at [[Runaway production]] and [[Hollywood North]]. Perhaps more than anything, this situation could really benefit from \""new blood\"" sifting through the conflicting contributions and sorting out what is appropriate. I'd also appreciate any advice you can provide me on how best to approach this matter as an editor - constructive criticism is always welcome. Thanks. --'''
[Ckatz]: If you have a dispute over the \""Awards\"" table, please take it up with [[User:Wizardman|Wizardman]]. The material wasn't deleted, it was incorporated into the body of the article. As for the \""semiprotected\"" tag, your use of it is inappropriate because the action of adding the tag does '''not''' actually protect the page. (Note, too, that this is at least the seventh time this template has been improperly applied to the page, including at least three attempts by you.) If you wish to seek protection for the page, you should go through proper channels and file a protection request. --'''
[Ckatz]: Please don't remove the \""unreferenced\"" tag - it serves to alert editors that an article needs some form of citation in order to support the text. This shouldn't be interpreted as a critique of the subject, only as a notice to ensure that deficiencies are addressed in a timely fashion. --'''
[Ckatz]: You have to provide proof that the material in the article is true, and verifiable. That means supplying links to sources - books, articles, websites - that fit under Wikipedia's [[WP:RS|guidelines]] for citations. I don't know what web site you're referring to (as it's not listed in the article) but generally speaking it has to be a reputable source, not a blog or a personal page. Hope this helps. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... I saw your request at the Village Pump. There is some code you can add to your monobook.js file to add an \""unwatch\"" link to your watchlist. You can find it [[User:Ilmari Karonen\/unwatch.js|here]]. I installed it a few weeks back, and haven't encountered any problems to date. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: It's pretty much a cut-and-paste edit. You copy the text in the box at [[User:Ilmari Karonen\/unwatch.js|Ilmari Karonen's page]] into your monobook.js file at [[User:Tvoz\/monobook.js]], making sure not to delete anything that's already in there. You then save that edit, and flush out your Internat browser's cache to see the changes. (For Firefox\/Mozilla\/Safari: hold down \""shift\"" while clicking RELOAD (or press Ctrl-Shift-R); for Internet Explorer: press Ctrl-F5; for Opera\/Konqueror: press F5.) The \""un\"" tag will show up on your watchlist next to items; clicking it removes the article. If you decide you want to remove the code, the easiest way is to revert yourself or undo the specific edit where you added this code. Good luck~ --'''
[Ckatz]: You might wish to read the following news items ([http:\/\/www.financialexpress.com\/fe_full_story.php?content_id=113572 NDTV, Astro, Value Labs to buy out Red FM] and [http:\/\/us.indiantelevision.com\/headlines\/y2k7\/feb\/feb64.htm Radio Today in talks to dilute 20 per cent to foreign strategic investor]), which explain how Red FM was sold to a consortium of NDTV, Value Labs, and Astro in 2006. --'''
[Ckatz]: Yes, I've checked that - the radio page gives a \""not available\"" message. Various news items ([http:\/\/www.indiantelevision.com\/headlines\/y2k6\/jan\/jan22.htm here's another one]) indicate there was a change in ownership as well. --'''
[Ckatz]: I won't revert for now, but I don't think it was necessary to remove all of the US units, as you did at [[Ceres (dwarf planet)]]. My point (in agreeing with Michael's removal of the escape velocity converison) was that it doesn't make sense to have one conversion at Ceres, while the other \""major\"" bodies (planets and dwarf planets) do not have the same conversion. If someone wants to do all of them at once, that would be a different matter. As it is right now, the removal of the US units from Ceres compunds the problem in that Ceres is now even more out of sync with the other infoboxes. --'''
[Ckatz]: Case in point - the addition of that material by [[User:Toddles29]] recently. It was done across all of the bodies at the same time for consistency. --'''
[Ckatz]: If you're referring to [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Battlestar_Galactica_%282004_TV_series%29&diff=109372085&oldid=109349394 this edit], I believe that you may have misread the edit history. As my comment (''\""Undid revision 109341872 by 69.77.132.17 (talk) rm. trivia\""'') states, I only removed some trivia about a mention of BSG on ''The Office''. This is in keeping with [[WP:TRIVIA|Wikipedia guidelines]] on avoiding trivia. [[User:Thethinredline|Thethinredline]]'s work on the \""Theology\"" section hasn't been altered. --'''
[Ckatz]: No problem at all. While I find the \""Undo\"" feature to be very useful, especially for removing entrenched vandalism, the default comment can be a bit hard to decipher. With all the text about '''who''' is being undone, the '''what''' tends to get lost. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... I saw your note at [[Talk:Pluto]]. As I stated there, I have no preference either way, and will go with consensus. The previous change was reverted because it was only changed at \""Pluto\"", there was no comment or explanation as to why, and (perhaps most importantly) because of [[User:Something14]]'s '''long''' history of making edit on Pluto-related articles to marginalize the \""dwarf planet\"" designation. Again, though, I'll go with whatever the group wants. Cheers, and thanks for bringing it up. --'''
[Ckatz]: Fair enough. So your thought is to go with the unbracketed version? [[Talk:Minor planet names#1 Ceres vs. (1) Ceres|This discussion]] seems to suggest that the \""official\"" method is to use brackets. However, it also gives examples of official usage with unbracketed numbers, and makes a good point about the unbracketed variant being more in line with the way astronomy articles are named on Wikipedia. Thoughts? --'''
[Ckatz]: Likewise - although I'm glad you decided to go with the version you did. Besides matching the related articles, I like the look better. Thanks. --'''
[Ckatz]: FYI, your page moves have been reverted. Wikipedia guidelines for page names dictate using the simplest name, not naming for consistency. --'''
[Ckatz]: No problem. It's certainly not the first time this has occurred on Wikipedia, and I can appreciate the desire for a consistent approach. The discussions over disambiguation - whether to go for the simplest name, or to go for consistency - have been rather heated at times, so I thought I would adjust your changes before you got caught up in the issue... Cheers, and good work BTW. --'''
[Ckatz]: I've restored a lot of the reference details that were removed by MatheoDJ, as well as fixing some other changes from the same edits. I'd appreciate it if you could please look over the article to make sure that the information you added is still present. Thanks. --'''
[Ckatz]: An editor has asked for a [[Wikipedia:Deletion review#{{{2|Duck on a Rock}}}|deletion review]] of [[:Duck on a Rock]]. Since you closed the deletion discussion for this article or speedy-deleted it, you might want to participate in the deletion review. '''
[Ckatz]: They're actually links to unofficial, advertising-supported blog site which do not meet [[WP:EL]]. --'''
[Ckatz]: Whoops... thanks for catching that. It's been really hard to keep track over the past while. I've made the change (and I notice that the page is now protected as well.) Cheers! --'''
[Ckatz]: It isn't a matter of whether or not there is a spoiler tag - it is that the material isn't considered encyclopedic. That level of detail about a series is better suited to a fan site, or to the ''Jericho'' wiki. --'''
[Ckatz]: Re: whether or not the Haitian is deceased. My bad - if Mohinder talks about killing him, then fair enough. Apologies for not catching that, and thanks for being so good-natured about it! (As you said, we have worked well together. Cheers!) --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello again... sorry it took a while to get back to you. I don't think the blog would suffice, as the writer appears to be guessing as well. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... sorry it took a few days to get back to you. I'll see what I can do with regards to the image. (I haven't done a lot of image declarations, but it is about time to learn...) Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hopefully it will be OK now. I've reworked an existing declaration from a promotional image used on the [[Kiefer Sutherland]] page. Please let me know what you think. --'''
[Ckatz]: No problem... good catch on the ''Private Eye'' text. My apologies for not leaving a note for you regarding the change - I was in a bit of a rush. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hmmm... I'd thought I just restored the ''Shrek'' text, but apparently I accidentally restored the \""Private Eye\"" text as well. Sorry about that - it has since been removed by another editor. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Dposse - you may wish to check out [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Television#Episode redirects|this issue]] regarding television episode articles. I've filed an AN\/I report on it, but it may be a difficult slog. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news. --'''
[Ckatz]: I've also left [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Heroes#Warning regarding episode articles|a note]] on the ''Heroes'' project page. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Done. (Generally speaking, unreferenced trivia should be weeded out.) Thanks for mentioning those two. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... sorry to bug you, but I just wanted to see what the story was with that page. (I had several not-so-nice messages from the creator after a redirect because of the content fork, and as such the explanation on the deletion log concerns me.) Did the editor file some sort of complaint, or post a speedy delete. or what? I'd appreciate any information you can provide. Thanks. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the information. Again, sorry to bother you about it - when I saw the comment, I wasn't concerned about you, but instead that perhaps some sort of action had been filed against me by the editor. What you've explained makes perfect sense. On a related note, I'd appreciate any input you might have as to how I handled things. From what I can see, the page was a pretty clear-cut redirect (or delete). It is about the Queen Charlotte Islands\/Haida Gwaii, for which there is already an article ([[Queen Charlotte Islands]]). It has some information about the Haida people, who are covered in detail in [[Haida]]. It has no references, is written in a non-encyclopedic manner, and closely parallels the information at the [http:\/\/www.purewest.com\/bluewater\/charlotte.html PureWest] and [http:\/\/www.bluewateradventures.ca\/destinations\/tripnotes\/queennotes.htm Blue Water Adventures] web sites. The editor in question ([[User:BCR123|BCR123]]) has also been cautioned by two different editors for adding inappropriate external links for a [http:\/\/www.islandsretreat.com QCI-based tourism company]. Thoughts? --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the reply. In this case, it wasn't a content dispute so much as a article fork, created and edited solely by the editor in question, that sprang up shortly after he\/she was reverted\/cautioned for adding spam links. I don't think it is AN\/I material... just a series of insults and insinuations. There comes a point where you get fed up with trying to be nice, and I'd prefer to ignore the editor rather than see the situation devolve. Thanks again. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the note. My changes weren't based on the U.K.-U.S. differences, but on the [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (titles)|style guide]] (and hence the changes were only to titles). In terms of titles, Wikipedia treats quotation marks as applying ''only'' to the title in question. All punctuation is kept outside of the quotation marks, and the same is true for italics as well. --'''
[Ckatz]: Unfortunately, that note isn't referenced either, and we cannot use Wikipedia pages to reference other Wikipedia pages. I've added a citation request to the ''Liar Liar\"" text. If one turns up, you can restore the text. --'''
[Ckatz]: As you've been told many times by several different editors, this is an international project and we have to write in a manner that reflects the audience. As for the warning, you are well aware that you changed the [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Smallville_%28TV_series%29&diff=prev&oldid=148626067 ''Smallville''] article once again, against the wishes of other editors and in an identical manner to your edits at [[Stargate SG-1]]. --'''
[Ckatz]: Please read through the [[WP:EL|external links]] guidelines - they will explain exactly why your link is being removed. If you feel that the SRTForums link is also unsuitable, please make your case on the article talk page. (As I've already explained there, I have no interest in the SRTForums link - if it is invalid as well, I'll remove it.) --'''
[Ckatz]: As well, an examination of the site (home page etc.) reveals that it appears to exist primarily to get viewers for advertising. (This is a subjective analysis,of course, but the home page boasts of \""anylizing reports\"" [sic] and information on the \""best looking girls\/boys in the world\"".) Sorry, but it just doesn't meet the guideline. --'''
[Ckatz]: As well, the ''lack'' of citations using \""language=English\"" would lead one to think that such usage is discouraged. Thoughts? --'''
[Ckatz]: Move completed. --'''
[Ckatz]: I've cleaned up the section to remove non-encyclopedic text and assertions. We'll see what the reaction is. --'''
[Ckatz]: I'm not interested, frankly, in a pointless war of words with you. However, I will say that it is very telling that you chose to respond to a disagreement over ''content'' with a carefully veiled ''personal'' jibe - that being the insinuation of vandalism on my part. I won't dwell on the insulting nature of your comment, other than to note that a) even the most cursory examination of my contribution history (and absence of blocks and warnings) would demonstrate that I spend an enormous percentage of my time on Wikipedia ''removing'' vandalism, and b) you obviously couldn't be bothered to make such an obvious, essential check of said records before hitting \""save\"". It is also interesting to point out that, according to your note on this page, my actions ''\""border on vandalism\""'' because I am ''\""very familiar\""'' with Wikipedia's policies. However, at the [[Talk:List of Farscape episodes#Upcoming Merge & Redirect per Wikipedia Guidelines & Notability Standards|''Farscape'' talk page]], you stated that I was ''\""unfamiliar\""'' with these same policies. Either I'm a really, really quick study (given that the messages are only three minutes apart) or else you're just saying whatever you feel like in order to try to justify your actions. Kind of sucks, really, and it is completely contrary to what this project is supposed to be about. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for asking. There's a long explanation\/discussion about the formatting at the ''Doctor Who'' project page. In a nutshell, Wikipedia convention is to use quotation marks for episode titles. The DW project, however, got into the habit of using italics instead, I think due to the fact that many titles refer to multi-episode serials rather than single episodes. The convention initially carried over to the new series, but more recently consensus was reached to move toward conforming with Wikipedia's guidelines. The new episodes were done first; I'm not sure what the plan is for the older ones. Hope this helps. --'''
[Ckatz]: There are several issues with regards to how you restructured the section. First off, there is no need whatsoever to separate \""former\"" and \""current\"" cast members. We treat the series as a whole, and the cast list reflects it as such. (Both of the examples you've used, ''Veronica Mars'' and ''X-Files'', avoid separate sections.) Similarly, your use of years isn't the most effective way of representing cast information, as a) viewers tend to think in terms of seasons rather than years, and b) the series is broadcast internationally, and Wikipedia itself is international. What North America sees as \""current\"" is not necessarily so for other regions. Personally, I have no problem with indicating when a character joined or left a series, but given the problems with your changes as a whole, the only viable option was a revert. Hope this answers your questions - please feel free to ask if you have more. --'''
[Ckatz]: Something simple, such as \""(season one)\"" or \""(season two, recurring in season one)\"" might be suitable. (FYI, I never presumed ''you'' were American; I was only referring to the fact that the series airs in ''North'' America ahead of many other parts of the world.) --'''
[Ckatz]: Alphabetical order, as per most other series articles. With your list, there was no easy way to find characters - some were alphabetical, others were grouped at the bottom. --'''
[Ckatz]: Useful feature, indeed. There is an \""undo\"" link in the page history - click it to have the option of undoing that edit. Alternatively, if you need to remove several edits in a row, use the \""diffs\"" option and undo that. (This works for edits by more than one editor.) Note that the edit will fail if there have been changes to the selected text in the meantime. For example, if Editor A vandalises a section, and Editor B edits a different section, you can undo Editor A. However, if Editor B makes a change to the same section of text, you can't undo Editor A's change. You could, however, undo Editors A ''and'' B if Editor C hasn't changed that section, and so on. This might not be the clearest explanation - please let me know if that is the case. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: I've had to remove the text again. While I appreciate the coincidence (and do find it interesting), the reality is that without some form of proof as to a connection, it is not considered to be encyclopedic. Are the game's creators ''Stargate'' fans? Perhaps - but computer games are released around this time anyways to meet the Christmas season. Are ''Stargate Atlantis'' producers fans of the game? Again, perhaps - but it is highly unlikely that they would alter the plot development of a season to match a game release date that could well change on short notice. However, if you feel strongly about it, please bring it up on the article's talk page. --'''
[Ckatz]: There are many bits of information about shows that do not qualify for inclusion. Countless bits of trivia are added on a daily basis across the television articles; some are deemed suitable for an encyclopedia article, while many others are removed. Does it mean the subject material isn't interesting? Not necessarily - just that it is not appropriate for Wikipedia. Take a look at the the articles for mature series - those such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[Doctor Who]]'', with strong Wikiprojects and hundreds of editors. Then, take a look at the articles for the newer, \""hit\"" series such as ''[[Heroes (TV series)|Heroes]]'' and ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]''. You'll see that they do not include week-to-week ratings information. Ratings, when included, are treated on a season-to-season basis. Hope this helps. --'''
[Ckatz]: No problem at all, and thanks for the note in return. I've restored your edit and added a request for a citation instead. (I saw the note you've pointed out at [[Julie Kavner]]. While it too is uncited, the attention to detail of the ''Simpsons'' Wikiproject is such that we can put out feelers for a reference rather than just removing it.) Thanks again for the contribution! --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks - that was added without discussion by an IP a few days back. It also shouldn't be there, and has been removed. --'''
[Ckatz]: There is a review process for television articles. THe preferred course of action, if article notability is questioned, is to redirect. Deletion is strongly discouraged. --'''
[Ckatz]: No problem - at the time, I wasn't aware the article had been merged. Thanks for the note. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... regarding the merge, the problem arose from a Wikipedia software upgrade that caused \""ref\"" tags being rendered as strings of numbers within the text of articles that were saved during a (roughly) 14 minute window. Unfortunately, your merge of \""Ted Sprague\"" occurred within that window and had to be reverted. Thanks for re-doing it. --'''
[Ckatz]: Sorry to say this, but I believe that you have misunderstood the actual events. If you'll refer to the edit history, it will reveal what really happened. [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Area_51&diff=173600788&oldid=173552101 This edit], by IP 84.197.122.26, deleted the \""Geography\"" section and replaced it with the racist material you described. Four minutes later, IP 71.11.128.83 [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Area_51&diff=next&oldid=173600788 reverted the vandalism], labelling it \""racism and spam\"". Your edit was done '''over two-and-one-half hours later''', and resulted in the second [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Area_51&diff=next&oldid=173601331 deletion of the entire \""Geography\"" section] (which at that point had no racist comments in it) with a thus-misleading edit description ''\""Deleted A Pointless & Stupid Racist Comment.\""'' ''That'' is what I reverted; '''an unexplained deletion by a low-edit IP account with an edit description that had no correlation with what was actually done'''. Given the inherent discrepancy between the comment and the action, and given that you were editing with an IP address, and given that it was the first edit from that IP address in almost two months, I feel my actions were entirely appropriate and justified. The only thing I can think of is that you saw the racist vandalism in the edit history, didn't realize that it had been removed, and thought you were removing it. Why you would delete an entire section, however, I cannot explain. I'm sorry that this happened to you, but I would respectfully state that it is ''you'', in fact, who should have checked the facts before making unsubstantiated and incorrect accusations against ''me''. --'''
[Ckatz]: The blog doesn't say this''is'' the season finale, it says that it is ''\""even more resolved and complete if, God forbid, the strike goes on so long that there is no more of season 2 than the first eleven.\""'' Beeman also says that they have every intention of producing more episodes for Season two if they are able to. (Sorry for the delay in responding - I was working on the rewrite.) --'''
[Ckatz]: Oh, I'm sure the debates will rage on endlessly. The confusion comes because of Kring's desire to make smaller \""volumes\"", or storylines. The ''season'' consists of an order of 23 episodes (season one) and 24 episodes (season two). However, this year, the ''volumes'' are shorter - last year's \""Genesis\"" ran for 23 episodes - all of season one - while \""Generations\"" was intended to run for 11 episodes and \""Villains\"" for 13 episodes, to make up season two. --'''
[Ckatz]: Sorry, but it's not \""disruptive\"" - I really don't think it is appropriate to archive the discussion at this time. The older material, yes, but not the more current material. (Sorry about the snow, too... if it makes you feel any better, the sun is partially obscured by some clouds right now.) --'''
[Ckatz]: By all means, have at it. I've already left you a note on your page... some of the material (as mentioned in my note) needs to go, as it is unencyclopaedic. FYI, I'm only removing text that isn't supported by the references provided, and cleaning up wording that is overly promotional. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: BTW, I did (of course) check the reference first. It is a college newspaper, and it says ''\""With its 2006 debut on NBC, Heroes hooked viewers with its \""save the cheerleader, save the world\"" mantra.\""'' That validates the use of mantra, but it does ''not'' support your assertion that ''\""In 2006, when Heroes debut on NBC, Save the Cheerleader, Save the World became a very popular mantra for the series\""''. That is why I worked the term \""mantra\"" into the line ''\""The series, along with its mantra \""save the cheerleader, save the world\"", has been referred to, featured and parodied in several other series...\""'' --'''
[Ckatz]: No problem, and I appreciate the note. I'm also trying to avoid an edit war, as that article has had enough battles in the past with \""DEYS\"". Accordingly, I've proposed what I feel is a possible solution at the talk page; please let me know what you think. Thanks again. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... for some reason, I had [[User:BayBoyBlues]] on my watchlist, so I noticed your post regarding the confusing usernames. FYI, I have filed a notice at the [[Wikipedia:Usernames for administrator attention]] message board regarding this. --'''
[Ckatz]: Ah, that was fast - the account has been blocked. If you have any future issues like this, you can file a request there (or feel free to ask me for assistance, if you like.) Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... thanks for the note. Hopefully, the [[WP:EL|guideline]] I supplied will help explain Wikipedia's approach to external links. However, I wasn't the one who removed your edit from the main article - that was done by someone else. I see you've restored it, which is fine as it seems valid. If, by chance, it is removed again, you may wish to bring it up on the talk page and explain why you feel it is warranted; that tends to be received better than simply reinserting. (By the way, with regards to ''\""how to carry on a conversation\""'' - you're doing just fine. Generally speaking, questions regarding article content go on the article's talk page, while questions regarding a specific editor's actions are best directed to that person's page.) Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: These are just some of the reasons for avoiding excessive lists. Yes, ''Lost'' may well have such lists, and I'm sure you could present other examples. That doesn't mean it is the best solution, however, and there are certainly examples of long-established, highly respected television articles that ''do not'' do this. (For example, ''[[The Simpsons]]'', which is generally regarded as an example of what we should strive for.) Thoughts? --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... thank you for the note, and for the offer of a nomination for adminship. As you've noted, I have been offered nominations in the past, but did not feel quite ready to accept at the time. However, I now feel more comfortable with accepting the responsibility. Would it be alright to think about it for a few days to be sure, and so that I can review the procedure? Thanks again. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the note; I'll re-run AWB when I get a chance. (IIRC, the changes from the scan were pretty minor.) I also took a look at the page, and the problems with the \""Reference\"" section seem to originate with the IP edits just following where you reverted to. The IPs removed a few brackets from the \""ref\"" and \""cite\"" coding that messed things up. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Fair enough... you've raised a valid point, and I did consider the whole \""removing a complaint about removing stuff\"" issue when making that change. Given the IP's limited contribution history, and the fact that the only contributions have been POV article text or forum-style talk page posts, I still think it was justified. However, I won't object if you wish to restore it. (Good to see you're still around, by the way!) --'''
[Ckatz]: A good suggestion... hmm... I saw that trick a short while back - I'll try to track down the coding. Thanks. --'''
[Ckatz]: Sorry for the delay. The links were repeatedly restored, despite cautions and notification that they were not suitable. (I've explained in more detail at your talk page.) --'''
[Ckatz]: Done. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... sorry to bother you, but I was just curious about the revert at [[Charlottetown]]. Anything in particular that was amiss with the reference regarding passenger volume? (No problem if I missed something, just let me know.) Cheers! --'''
[Ckatz]: Fair enough. Any thoughts about how we might rework the line to include \""we\"" and still make it a bit more formal? (Part of why I removed it was because I thought \""we know [[life]] exists\"" was a bit casual.) --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello again, and thanks for your patience. Yes, I would be happy (and appreciative) to accept the nomination. I would like to spend a few days reading through the admin. reading lists, to prepare for the process. Does that work for you? --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks very much, both for the nom and the kind words. I've accepted the nomination, completed the questionnaire and have transcluded the RfA. Thanks again. --'''
[Ckatz]: (''edit conflict'')Please stop restoring the links - they fail Wikipedia's [[WP:EL|guideline for external links]]. First off, the link you added to [[Spacewar!]] has no relation to the page, other than a similarity in name. The other two links don't add anything to the respective page, I'm sorry to say. That, really, is what we use as a standard, not \""equal access\"". (There are many, many, many space-related sites like yours that do not make the cut.) Beyond that, you have already been advised about the conflict of interest; as a principal in the company, you cannot be considered neutral when it comes to assessing the perceived value of your product. Please don't just keep restoring the links, as it will only result in a block of your IP, or worse, a spam-block of your domain. A more productive approach would be to try to seek consensus amongst editors that there is some merit to including a link to your site. Hope this helps. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... a question - what does one do when a SPA\/suspected sock puppet comments at an RfA? Should I even respond? I'm concerned that doing so might just be what the guy wants, but on the other hand I don't know if it is considered bad form to just ignore the comments. (I strongly suspect this is from the 143.*.*.* IP\/confirmed \""EverybodyHatesChris\"" sock who disagreed with my edits this afternoon.) Any guidance you can offer would be appreciated. Thanks... --'''
[Ckatz]: With all due respect, it is hardly fair to make such a statement just because I was not able to respond instantly. As to your tags, there was no need to add ''four'' additional templates to the section, especially with an edit comment such as ''\""Well, let's go all out then, shall we?\""'' Soulscanner had added the \""disputed\"" tag, to which you added \""cleanup-section\"", \""copyedit\"", \""repetition\"" and \""misleading\"". At the most, you should have added ''one'' tag - the \""cleanup-section\"" template. The others are repetitive; \""copyedit\"" and \""repetition\"" are already covered by \""cleanup\"", while \""misleading\"" is addressed through the existing \""disputed\"" tag. The edit war you and Soulscanner are involved in is disruptive enough, and I'm not favouring either side. The simple fact is that the extra templates did not help, so they were removed. --'''
[Ckatz]: The latter, to verify that they do it to attract US listeners. It seems plausible, as it could attract American advertising, but a cite seemed in order. Since you've removed the text it applied to, I'll remove the template. (By the way, thanks for the note (and the vote)) Cheers! --'''
[Ckatz]: Thank you very much... and thanks for the \""new admin school\"" tip. That will help with the learning curve. Cheers! --'''
[Ckatz]: Sorry, just missed this last night. I'll try to look over the article and give you some feedback. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: The links are not being used as references; they are being spammed across many pages, most recently by single-purpose IPs which appear to be in use by the same person or persons. Furthermore, this is not the first time this URL has been involved in questionable postings; problems date back to at least March of 2007, when [[User:Sportsint|Sportsint]] was repeatedly warned regarding spam. (It even appears that the URL was added to Wikipedia's spam filter for a period of time.) Wikipedia is not a collection of links; just because an interviews exists does not grant it the automatic right to be listed. --'''
[Ckatz]: Please read through the [[WP:EL|external links guideline]]; I would be happy to answer any questions you might have. However, please remember that you have been given final warnign regarding these links. --'''
[Ckatz]: Sorry, but we'll have to discuss this through the talk page as I'm not on a chat service. As for your concerns, I'm not sure how much more helpful one can get. I've explained the guideline regarding external links, I've given you a link to that page as well as to previous concerns regarding the URL, and I've held off on other measures despite repeated reverts.  --'''
[Ckatz]: Unfortunately, the remainder of my comment was cut off; a simple search in English found 1,800 hits on Boulaich. Obviously, not all will be useful, but several of the hits (book on Amazon, part of university-level course reading, etc.) are sufficient to establish that a speedy deletion is in fact inappropriate. Beyond that, I would ask that you assume good faith on the part of your fellow editors, and avoid making unwarranted <s>threats<\/s> suggestions that this action in any way warrants an AN\/I report. Note that the speedy deletion policy explicitly states that ''\""deletion is not required if a page meets these criteria\""'' and ''\""Any editor who is not the creator of a page may remove a speedy tag from it.\""'' Speedies are a ''request'' for deletion, not a directive. As an ''administrator'', I'm expected to assess your request, determine if it is warranted, and act accordingly. As an ''editor'', I'm entitled to disagree with your opinion. --'''
[Ckatz]: Out of respect for your reply, I've changed \""threat\"" to \""suggestion\"". However, that doesn't change my underlying concern that you would consider this as being even remotely worthy of an AN\/I report. Those are generally reserved for serious issues, not minor disagreements over content (which is what this is.) --'''
[Ckatz]: To quote another editor, ''\""The fact that there's a keep !vote here already indicates to me that it would have been inappropriate to speedily delete the article. Speedy deletion is only for those cases that are so obvious that there is no need to waste everyone's time with a debate.\""'' (This is from the [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\/Regina Freedman|deletion debate for Regina Freedman]]; while that article did end up being deleted, it is another instance where you took issue with an editor who disagreed with your use of CSD:A7.) Look, obviously, we're not in agreement on this matter; why not agree to disagree and put this behind us? --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the note. Unfortunately, the links don't meet [[WP:EL|the external links guideline]]. I've explained in greater detail [[User talk:198.182.9.42#External links|on your talk page]]. --'''
[Ckatz]: With all due respect, your links do not meet the requirements. However, we cannot disrupt the page over the links section, so I have followed standard practice as per the [[WP:EL|guideline]] and inserted a link to the Open Directory Project. The ODP is, to quote their site, ''\""the largest, most comprehensive human-edited directory of the Web.\""'' Wikipedia recommends the use of this search engine as a means of avoiding dispites over external links sections in articles. You are free to submit any and all links you wish to that site; the submission page is [http:\/\/www.dmoz.org\/add.html here]. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... thanks for the note. Well, the name popped up on the 'bot list, and did not come across as a serious attempt to create an acceptable ID. Factor in the nonsense article, and the soft-block seemed warranted. I won't object if you feel inclined to revert, however. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the note. Unfortunately, those articles were vandalized by [[User:Bnationalp]] ''and'' by that user's IP address; hence the complication when reverting. The user and the IP have been temporarily blocked; please let me know if you see more vandalism from either party. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: \""thesportsinterview\"" links have been repeatedly spammed across a series of articles for over a year now, and the URL was even on the spam list for a period of time. A host of single-purpose IPs have surfaced, their only goal being to add links to this site to articles. The external links guideline does not condone adding links just because an interview ''exists''; otherwise, we would have hundreds of links on these pages. You have been advised of this repeatedly; please respect the site guidelines. --'''
[Ckatz]: You are welcome to seek a second opinion, but to be perfectly honest you are in all likelihood going to get exactly the same response. Wikipedia does not exist as a directory for links; furthermore, the fact that your links were \""up for a year\"" does not indicate that they should have been placed to begin with. There are well over two million articles on Wikipedia, so it does take time to clean up problems. You are not the first site owner to question why his or her links are being removed; many, many people have done the same thing, because they do not see the difference between Wikipedia and other web sites. I've said this before, but I'll say it again: do not take it as a comment on your site, merely the reality that the links are not suitable for this project. --'''
[Ckatz]: I think we need to clarify another issue as well. Based on the conversations you've had today, I think that you may be under the wrong impression as to what Wikipedia is. This site is ''not'' a public forum, a search engine, or a directory service. The aim of the project is to build an online encyclopedia, one that \""anyone can edit\"". That involves several core principles that govern what sort of content is deemed acceptable; we have to ensure that text is [[WP:V|verifiable]], obtained from [[WP:RS|reliable sources]], [[WP:N|notable]], and so on. [[Wikipedia:Notability (organizations and companies)|Companies are not permitted to use Wikipedia for advertising purposes]], which is why an article about an organization is expected to avoid resembling that organization's promotional material. Related to this, web site owners are cautioned about [[WP:COI|contributing information that benefits their interests]], and [[WP:EL|external links to sites]] are not permitted just because (for example) an interview exists. There are millions of companies world-wide that will [[Wikipedia:FAQ\/Business|never be able to have Wikipedia articles]], not because they are bad or because Wikipedians dislike them, but instead because they do not demonstrate sufficient notability for inclusion. Think of it this way - you would expect your company to be permitted to have a listing in the phone directory, alongside CNN or the ''New York Times''. Would you, however, be offended if those organizations were written up in the ''Encyclopedia Brittanica'' and yours was not? --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... I see you've noticed this editor as well. Any thoughts as to what to do - the name is debatable, and the edits are hit-and-miss. (They also seem quite advanced for a brand-new account.) --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the feedback. Yes, the speed was one of the odd things; the self-congratulation on the user page was interesting as well. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Andrew, per the comments that have been left on your talk page, at least three editors other than myself have reviewed your site and felt that it did not meet the external links guideline. This doesn't mean your site is bad, but Wikipedia is not a links directory or a search engine. We don't link to ''every'' site with content. The project works on based on consensus, and the consensus so far has been that your links don't belong. Please see my note on your talk page as well. --'''
[Ckatz]: It is understandable that you would feel strongly about your site, and it is also commendable that you are trying to adapt it based on comments from others. However, one key problem lies in ''you'' being the one to add links to the site, since there is an obvious [[WP:COI|conflict of interest]]. You'd need to convince other editors that the site has something unique and distinct to offer, and let ''them'' be the ones to add the site. FYI, blogs and user-edited sites often have a more difficult go of it than other sites with stricter editorial oversight. As for the other links you mention, the general feeling here is that the existence of invalid links (again, using \""invalid\"" as a reflection of WP's links guideline rather than site quality) does not justify the addition of ''more'' links. If you feel some existing links aren't appropriate, you are encouraged to suggest they be removed. (Ordinarily, I'd say to remove them yourself, but again the \""conflict of interest\"" issue arises.) --'''
[Ckatz]: One point to consider: the message you're currently posting is too \""promotional\"" in nature, and may well cause additional problems. I would suggest you remove the old text and reword it to briefly describe the site and its features in simple, \""hype-free\"" text. Most importantly, '''be sure to mention your role''', the fact it was deemed unsuitable previously, and that you have reworked it on the basis of comments received here. That way, there is nothing \""hidden\"", you avoid the \""hey. look at this great site\"" spam messaging that is discouraged here, and you put everything out there for editors to assess. Again, you may or may not be successful, and it would probably be case-by-case. Hope this helps. --'''
[Ckatz]: Further to this, remember that on Wikipedia, an \""administrator\"" is just an editor with some extra tools to assist in enforcing policies and guidelines established by ''all'' editors. Your actions and the IP's actions contravened a long-established requirement for verifiability, and as such can (and should) be removed when discovered. While editors are encouraged to discuss the matter - as Bignole did by posting on the respective talk pages - it would be inappropriate to allow unreferenced material to remain until said discussion is complete. --'''
[Ckatz]: Done - I've restored the version immediately prior to the posting of the AfD notice. (There were no revisions after that point.) The only change I've made is to comment out the categories and the interwiki links. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Done. Thanks for letting me know. --'''
[Ckatz]: No problem - please let me know if this persists after the protection is released. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the note. I've found the \""DMOZ\"" link to be pretty useful so far... the ''Sliders'' page most definitely wasn't an \""issue\"" by any stretch, but there are other pages (in TV, cars, etc.) that have had real problems with external links. It seems to address several concerns, especially complaints along the lines of \""why isn't my site here if that one is\"", while still providing easy links to fan pages. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: There is still a need to provide proper references, and a check of the other pages shows that it wasn't referenced there either. Please try to provide some, as much of the article is unreferenced. --'''
[Ckatz]: The warnings to RP were a part of a larger issue, rather than any specifics about formatting. (Good to check, though, if you're aiming for FA - hope it goes well!) For your question, I would suggest going with 01 January 2001, and then applying [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)#Autoformatting and linking|wiki markup]] to the date as <nowiki>[[01 January]] [[2001]]<\/nowiki>. That will allow it to appear based on a user's preferences. Hope this helps. --'''
[Ckatz]: I'll take a look. It should be possible to split the history, but I'll have to double-check. Might take a while before I can get to it, but I will let you know either way. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hey, Michael, sorry to hear that you're leaving. I can relate to the time thing... hopefully, you'll be able to stick around in some capacity as it would be a real shame to lose you altogether. Best of luck, and hope to see you here again. --'''
[Ckatz]: By the way, what do you mean by \""stasis\"" - would you like your pages semi-protected against vandalism, or what? (Just let me know.) --'''
[Ckatz]: The section (not page) was removed initially because of questions over its notability. Keep in mind that while the game may have had a fair number of players, that does not necessarily mean it warrants inclusion. Given that the series is now over, you may find that a lot of material that is currently in the article (''Tom Tooman'', ''Beyond Jericho'', etc.) ends up being removed by the editors if there is no indication of lasting importance. However, I've left it in for now after cleaning it up a bit. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: No bother - and done. (I'd noticed the connection between the two as well. Thanks for keeping an eye on it.) --'''
[Ckatz]: Again, no problem - feel free to ask any time. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Wow... glad you caught that, as it certainly wasn't what was intended; I'd only meant to undo a spammed external link in that article and several others. Seems the utility I was using did something other than what it reported, so I'll review the other edits as well. Thanks for bringing it to my attention, and sorry for the inconvenience. --'''
[Ckatz]: With respect to the image, it is important to discuss a change of this nature ''first'' because there are several issues with regards to the replacement. The replacement images have been retouched (by a Wikipedia editor) and cropped, and were actually mislabelled in some instances as being \""Pluto and Charon\"". (According to the official source, the two discs are both Pluto.) Furthermore, this is ''not'' a question of using a \""prettier\"" image, as evidenced by the number of comments about the \""disco ball\"" ([[:Image:Pluto.jpg]]). Despite these complaints, we have used that image because it does better serve the \""encyclopedic purpose\"". The original is a ''more accurate'' representation of Pluto, being a true-colour image. --'''
[Ckatz]: This message is being left for both parties - please stop edit warring over the use of flags in the television template. This is a content dispute; reverting one another over and over is more detrimental to the project than the presence (or lack thereof) of an image. Both of you are in danger of violating the [[WP:3RR|three-revert guideline today; CJ2005B may already have done so. As well, to correct Islander, the template instructions are simply that - instructions for use. They do ''not'' mandate the use of a flag icon, nor should they be considered as being on the same level as an official guideline. --'''
[Ckatz]: The edit war being \""already over\"" (and Islander's being a sysop) aren't really relevant - the note was still valid. I'll emphasize, however, that it was just a note, not a warning or a template. If you've resolved it between yourselves, great, I was only trying to stop the back-and-forth on the page. However, since it has been brought up, I'm curious to ask Islander why he\/she (sorry) \""completely disagrees\"" with me. (I'm presuming it is in regards to the template-guideline comparison.) --'''
[Ckatz]: Ah, but guidelines do have a higher status (if you will) than template instructions, as a guideline must reach consensus to ''become'' a guideline. (The template documentation is just that - instructions on how to use the code - and does not have the same weight. (As well, the template instructions do not say one''must'' use a flag, or even that flags are recommended. They only give a link to where you can find flag templates.) --'''
[Ckatz]: It is in [http:\/\/www.inspection.gc.ca\/english\/fssa\/labeti\/guide\/ch11e.shtml Section 11.2], stated as ''\""Metric units must be used or, '''metric units and any other equivalent unit of measurement''', provided that the metric units are displayed more prominently.\""'' (The relevant text is in bold text for emphasis.) Hope this helps. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... yes, we've been tracking and reverting the same person\/link. However, [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Steveston%2C_British_Columbia&diff=213414263&oldid=213345684 the revert you're referring to] actually involved the URL www.steveston.bc.ca; the spammer (after having his\/her handiwork removed yet again) [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Steveston%2C_British_Columbia&diff=213343955&oldid=213343195 deleted that link] out of what I can only assume is spite. --'''

[Ckatz]: No problem, always happy to answer questions. Thanks for getting rid of today's spam, by the way. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... regarding your message, I appreciate your concern - but it would have been more appropriate to enquire as to the situation rather than just assuming the worst. I'm certainly not interested in edit warring, nor do I personally care about where the redirect goes. However, there was an established consensus as to where the redirect should go, and the page has been plagued with multiple changes since then (usually from newer editors who aren't aware of the consensus.) Part of an administrator's role is to ensure consensus reached through discussion is maintained, and that involves using our discretion to do so. In this case, it is clear that leaving the page redirected to the TV series will not achieve that goal. Accordingly, the best choice is to protect the consensus version. If you disagree, I'm happy to discuss it with you - and I do apologize if my edit summary wasn't clear as to my intentions. However, I still feel that there is no need whatsoever to suggest a \""misuse\"" of the admin bit when a thorough examination of the details clearly reveals it is not. --'''

[Ckatz]: Look, this really shouldn't be such a big deal. I can assure you that it is certainly not meant as any sort of comment on your move to protect the page. I'll revert myself if you wish, but I really think you should open a discussion on the matter - or at least make some sort of mention of it - on the talk page. Otherwise, the page remains locked, there's no clear explanation of why, and the regulars who have been working under consensus are left in the dark. --'''
[Ckatz]: In principle, the idea is interesting. However, the template itself is not designed for such a fine degree of directional input, nor is it appropriate given the constraints imposed by the typial Wikipedia page. (For example, while you've squeezed in the directions you did, there's not really any room to add their counterparts that require horizontal space.) This template is only intended to give an ''approximate'' indication of where other cities are. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... couple of questions for you. One, I noticed you restored the \""image\"" code. My thought on removing it was that it encourages use of images for decorative purposes, which is contrary to [[WP:FLAG]]. Second, I've reverted some other changes from earlier today which added fields for WNW, ENE, WSW, and ESE. I think they are a bit too fine a detail for this template, especially given that there's no room to add NNW etc. What do you think? --'''
[Ckatz]: The changes have been removed again, pending discussion. (I've asked the other editor who maintains the template to comment as well.) Again, the addition of the additional points is not necessary, and does not improve the template in its current form. In fact, it actually complicates the design, as it is nearly impossible to differentiate between the different positions given the coarse resolution possible with a text-based template system. (This is especially true with longer entries that tend to wrap.) If you still feel strongly about his, I would suggest you open a discussion on the template page to get input from other editors. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the note. However, the correct wording (per Wikipedia convention) is to retain the present tense. Creative works are considered to exist even after ceasing production. --'''
[Ckatz]: The link was removed because it does not meet the [[WP:EL|external links guideline]]. Ths is not a comment on the quality of your site, merely a reflection of the fact that Wikipedia is not intended to serve as a directory service. Hope this helps. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the note. Regarding the revert, keep in mind that it was a case of an anonymous IP editor whose only two edits were to 1) add speculative trivia, then 2) restore that trivia without explanation after it was removed. As for the information, it is non-notable trivia, as explained by the other editor who reverted your text. Hope this helps. --'''
[Ckatz]: I'm not sure what your question is. I'll presume that you are referring to the fact that your edits are listed under your IP address. That is because you have chosen to edit anonymously, without registering. All edits must be logged under the licence used for Wikipedia's content; if you prefer not to display your IP, just click on the \""Log in\/Create account\"" button. (Registering also allows you to have a personal talk page, create a watchlist for pages you've edited and\/or wish to follow, and so on.) Please feel free to ask if you have any questions about this. --'''
[Ckatz]: No problem - and thanks forleaving me a note so that I could correct my previous message. As mentioned, the issue is with adding promotional links. You may find the [[WP:EL|external links guideline]] helpful in understanding this; feel free to ask if you have any questions about it. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Per the release, ''\""The two known and named plutoids are Pluto and Eris. It is expected that more plutoids will be named as science progresses and new discoveries are made.\""'' The text further down about naming apears to be related to resolving the overlap with regards to naming objects between the IAU (planetary bodies and their satellites), the WGPSN (surface features) and the CSBN (small bodies except satellites of the major planets). I'm sure we'll eventually see Sedna et al declared as plutoids\/dwarf planets, but for now only two are official. --'''
[Ckatz]: It isn't a question of where they are from. The [[WP:MOS|Manual of Style]] - specifically, the[[WP:FLAG| section regarding use of flags]] - outlines how we are supposed to avoid the decorative use of images. --'''
[Ckatz]: Being (or not being) a \""scientific paper\"" has nothing to do with it. This is an encyclopedia, with a series of policies and guidelines developed under consensus. Please read through the Manual of Style and the [[WP:FLAG|guideline for use of flags]]. While you may find the use of the image esthetically pleasing, that does not make it acceptable under the site's rules. Neither does the presence elsewhere. Also, please stop reverting without discussion as that is not permitted either. --'''
[Ckatz]: That may or may not be the case, but disagreeing with site policies doesn't give you the right to ignore them. If you disagree, the proper method is to seek change of the guideline. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello, and thank you for the swift response. Tonight's vandalism was relatively minor in nature, being more of a nuisance factor. However, I did block for six months based on past history. Given your attention to the matter, however, I have now reduced that term to two months, and (as per your request) extended it to the second IP. Thank you again for taking a proactive approach to this matter. Please feel free to ask if you have nay questions about this. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: There are a number of issues with the graphic, and its placement. First off, we shouldn't be tinkering with the lead while the poll is under way. Secondly, the graphic itself is confusing and hard to interpret. There is no explanation of what the different axes represent, no qualification as to how the results are compiled, and no indication as to whether or not it is even relevant. Counting rollbacks is not a definitive measure of vandalism; rollbacks are often used as a speedy revert of other material, especially given that many users have scripts that allow proper edit comments when rolling back. Finally, I'm not sure why you feel it is appropriate to include this  graph when you were opposed to including the poll results. --'''
[Ckatz]: I could respond in so many ways to this... anger, over a '''nonsensical''' accusation of racial bias; frustration, given that you've obviously not read the [[WP:EL|external links guideline]]... Look, this isn't a link directory. If there are other sites that (as with yours) should not be there, let me know. Don't resort to making ridiculous, unfounded, confrontational, unfair, insensitive and meaningless accusations just because your nose is out of joint. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thing is, you have to provide a [[WP:RS|reliable source]] for the claim. Memory isn't good enough; it has to be something [[WP:V|verifiable]]. --'''
[Ckatz]: Reverting changes by an editor with a history of POV incidents is perfectly acceptable, and does not in any way limit my responsibilities as an admin. --'''
[Ckatz]: Simply put, they are not permitted under any circumstances; this isn't just a guideline, it is [[WP:NPA|policy]]. I'll take a look at the page. --'''
[Ckatz]: Already taken care of. --'''
[Ckatz]: The contributions, however, suggest the editor isn't serious. Seeing as how you're the target, though, I've no issues if you wish to adjust. --'''
[Ckatz]: Generally speaking, Wikipedia doesn't use spoiler tags, even in references. Hope this helps. --'''
[Ckatz]: Either way, it isn't a suitable contribution, and has been removed. --'''
[Ckatz]: No problem at all - thanks for your work as well. Sneaky vandals... --'''
[Ckatz]: It is important to note that there was no discussion of the page moves to begin with, nor any consensus to do so. (The first move was an undiscussed move by a newish editor who wanted to affirm the US dates.) As well, per [[WP:BOLD]], keep in mind that the second part of that guideline states ''\""...but be careful\""''. In the case of an established page with dozens (if not hundreds) of pages linking to it, it is better to initiate a move discussion ''first''. Yes, the episode list is under \""reimagined\"", but the older series is titled \""(1978 series)\"". I've no real preference, but I do feel that the proper way to do this is to discuss it first, so that there can be a) consensus and b) a coordinated effort to clean up all the loose ends afterwards. Thoughts? --'''
[Ckatz]: Read through [[Special:Contributions\/74.234.19.110|your edit summaries]]. They are clearly disruptive, clearly inappropriate, and you've been (clearly) warned. --'''
[Ckatz]: Actually, no, just had other things to do. First off, not all of your content is \""fine\"", as demonstrated by the fact that you have been reverted by several different editors. Second, there is a vast difference between an encyclopedia article on the ''word'' \""fuck\"" and your [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Tyers_River_railway_station%2C_Victoria&diff=prev&oldid=226361781 edit summary about a misplaced comma] saying <blockquote>''\""What kind of fucking IDIOT places a comma in a place like that? Jesus fucking Christ I could see a frigging semi-colon, but how far up your ass would you have to stick your head to find that comma?\""''<\/blockquote>Surely you can see the difference.--'''
[Ckatz]: The article does not meet the [[WP:N|notability requirements]] for inclusion. (Please note that this is not a reflection on the quality of the band.) You may wish to see if you can locate reviews, references, etc. to support an article. --'''
[Ckatz]: I've restored it to a sub-page of your user page; you can find it [[User:Waleran\/Hrvoje Banaj|here]]. Please feel free to ask if you have any questions about the article. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Done. Thanks for letting me know. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello, and welcome! Thanks for the contribution. It was, however, removed because of Wikipedia's [[WP:EL|external links guideline]]. (In a nutshell, this site isn't a directory service, so we usually only add links that supplement the information in an article, as opposed to providing links ''to'' search engines.) Don't let this deter you, though, as your participation is appreciated. --'''
[Ckatz]: Please don't make assumptions as to why I make certain edits. I would suggest that you  discuss your proposed changes in greater detail and seek consensus first, rather than the method you are currently using. [[Solar System]] is a well-established and featured article, one that has been through numerous reviews. Does that mean it is perfect, and should never be changed? Of course not - but it does indicate we should approach changes differently from the way we would for a developing article. --'''
[Ckatz]: Simply put, you tried something, I disagreed. This is not a case to be \""formally contested\""; instead, I would suggest you open a discussion on the article's talk page to see if anyone else supports your idea. --'''
[Ckatz]: Getting that way; I've just given notice on the talk page. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the note. After checking the contributions, it seems to match. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks - the never-ending string of socks continues. --'''
[Ckatz]: With all due respect, Tony, the onus is on you to seek site-wide consensus for a change largely championed and desired by you, rather than the article-by-article non-consensus method you are currently using. --'''
[Ckatz]: Sorry, but I'd prefer it if you didn't try to marginalize my concerns through the use of terms such as the unjustified \""hysterical\"" (here) and the offhand \""might have traction\"" (on your talk page, to myself and to another editor). I made an effort to explain my minor tweaks in the edit summaries, and have expanded upon that on the talk page. As for the DA, I have never said you were the only one pushing for optional status. I do, however, object to the way in which you are ''removing'' it without seeking a widespread consensus. That should definitely be discussed (and consensus reached) on a wider scale, not just in a conversation between us. --'''
[Ckatz]: Unfortunately, the text as written does ''not'' help toward that goal. It needs a rewrite, contains a lot of speculative material, and too much plot detail for the main article. While your efforts are certainly appreciated, in this case it would be better to discuss first. --'''
[Ckatz]: Please see my response on the article talk page. --'''
[Ckatz]: The partnership is described in the lead paragraph - complete with your reference. (Your text ''\""Executives from both companies expressed optimism...\""'' has been removed because it is not encyclopedic.) The lead also mentions, in the first sentence, that Scripped offers script registration and script coverage. --'''
[Ckatz]: As mentioned previously, what you need is to provide references that establish the [[WP:N|notability]] of the research. At present, we only establish that it is ''happening'' - not that it is notable. (Many companies fund research in areas they are involved in; that does not make the research encyclopedic.) --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for leaving a note. No worries about wheel-warring at all; I think you've done a good job in monitoring the discussion. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: There's no need for the aggressive tone here and in your edit summaries. My suggestion was merely to discuss the change *before* implementing it, not after. Simply put, many of the astronomy pages are high-traffic articles with relatively stable content; several have reached GA and FA status, so the general aim is to try to coordinate changes rather than just alter individual articles. --'''
[Ckatz]: FYI, the standard format for listing stars is alphabetical. Please don't just revert against this long-standing custom; if you do not agree with it, the better option is to open a discussion through the television project. Thanks. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the input; I certainly considered those points before issuing the block. However, HarryAffla has a long, long history of single-purpose editing on [[Solar System]], an equally long history of edit warring and ignoring input from others, and a habit of making inappropriate accusations against editors who disagree with him. While I have edited [[Solar System]] at length, I have made a point of avoiding this particular dispute as an ''editor'' (as HA has commented on at length) in order to remain impartial as an administrator. I've no objection, though, if you or anyone else wishes to review the matter, as I feel the contribution history for HA will more than justify the action. Thanks again. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hulu links aren't typically added, plus the content is often restricted to certain geographic regions, making it unsuitable. --'''
[Ckatz]: Re: the revert, fair enough. Thanks for the note, and let the discussions begin... --'''
[Ckatz]: Done, and thanks for the suggestion. Good to see you around, by the way. How was the trip? --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks, I'll try to review this tomorrow and give some feedback. However, it is probably best to present the ideas at the talk page, so that everyone can provide input. --'''
[Ckatz]: You need to provide verifiable references that support the text. [[WP:RS|This guideline on sourcing]] and [[WP:V|this one on verifiability]] may help explain what is needed. Please feel free to ask if you have more questions. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Please see your talk page; we sent messages at the same time. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... FYI, I'll need to revert your move to [[Template:Sp]], then move it to a new name in the \""Template\"" space, as that name was used earlier in a now-deleted template. If you could please suggest an alternate name - perhaps something that better indicates what the template is for - I can then make the move. Thanks. --'''
[Ckatz]: Sorry, but you are completely mistaken. Removing the \""Cheetah Girls\"" image is in no way whatsoever an \""administrative action\"", does not involve any administrative tools, and is based entirely on reading the [[WP:POINT|appropriate guideline]] and comments made by other editors at [[Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion\/2008 October 23#Section break 3|the Doctor Who image discussion]]. ''Any'' user, even including an anonymous IP, can make that edit. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... thanks for asking about this. The removal should not be taken as a comment on the NYMR in any way; apologies if my edit summary wasn't clear enough. Unfortunately, there has been an ongoing issue with spammed ITV links over the past year. This link was removed because it is one of many ITV links that were added en masse by single-purpose users and IPs tracing back to ITV itself. Please feel free to ask me if you have any other questions. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Likewise, no problem at all. In future, just remember to go to the admin first. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Please see the sources provided. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the note; I've trimmed the list, added a link to the Open Directory Project's \""horror\"" category, and cleaned it up. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: No problem. I've found that the Open Directory link (the template <nowiki>{{dmoz}}<\/nowiki>) can help resolve problem with excessive link build-up. It is Wikipedia-endorsed, and if editors want to add links, they can be directed to the ODP to submit the links there. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the note. The [[Open Directory Project]] is a volunteer project to create directories of Internet sites arranged by category. Given its volunteer nature, it has been deemed a suitable link for Wikipedia articles, and has become a useful tool in reducing excessive build-up of links. The template <nowiki>{{dmoz}}<\/nowiki> is used to provide a direct link to a category on the ODP; if editors want to add links to fan sites, they can be directed to the ODP to submit the links there. Hope this helps. --'''
[Ckatz]: Not a source, in the reference sense, but it is a organized directory of links. URLs are submitted to the volunteers for possible inclusion, and (if accepted) are added to one or more categories. DMOZ is considered a preferred alternative to a long list of links in an article. --'''
[Ckatz]: Tony, you know full well it is perfectly relevant to the discussion. Furthermore, it clearly indicates the time at which it was added, and there is also a mention in \""meta-discussion\"" for, well, discussion. Finally, I might add that you did not extend the courtesy of notifying anyone about your RfC to begin with - despite its overlap with one that was already under development - so you can hardly complain about what is \""appropriate\"". --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... unfortunately, your edits have had to be reverted again. The character of Daphne in ''Heroes'' does not warrant an article at present; all efforts to create one have only contained plot, whereas an article on a minor character would need significant real-world information to justify it. --'''
[Ckatz]: Useful information might include comments from the producers on the role, casting notes as to who was considered for the part, long-term influence of the character on the main characters, and so on. Again, though, this would all have to be sourced. --'''
[Ckatz]: --'''
[Ckatz]: Greg, I'm uncertain as to how there could be any confusion leading to the AN post, given that I told you point-blank that I had not contacted anyone when we discussed this two days ago. However, I do appreciate the retraction here and at the AN board. In the spirit of putting this behind us, I have tweaked my post at AN accordingly, and am willing to consider this closed if you are. --'''
[Ckatz]: Wikipedia also doesn't cover those sort of errors; virtually every film ever made has them, and they are really just a form of trivia. Generally speaking, we only note details such as those when someone else has made a note of it, such as if a film critic takes the producers to task for sloppy errors. --'''
[Ckatz]: They are interesting, for sure, but unfortunately they are not notable in the context of an \""encyclopaedic\"" treatment of the subject. (That is why I've had to remove it from the ''Iron Man'' film article as well.) Now, again, if some of these become notable through observations of third-party sources, they would then be suitable for inclusion. For example, there may be an Army official who comments on the errors in the war scenes. Alternatively, the producers might note (on a DVD commentary or similar medium) that they purposefully changed some aspect in order to achieve a certain dramatic effect. That would help to give the article a greater \""real-world\"" context.  Hope this helps; if I ever come across such observations, I'd be happy to pass them along to you. --'''
[Ckatz]: Stifle, with regards to this site, I've been reviewing the user's contribution history, the site itself, and the quality of online references to the site. I'm not sure that we need to remove this one from the blacklist, as the article appears to be purely for promotional purposes. Thoughts? --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the note (and for taking care of the notice) - both are appreciated. --'''

[Ckatz]: It's really more of an interface tweak than an editing tool; the \""editing\"" gadgets are special-purpose tools such as Twinkle and WikEd that offer a lot of features. Not a big deal, of course, but it seems a better fit where it is now. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the feedback. From what I could determine in past discussions about the ''Mail'', it is considered to be semi-reliable - not \""tabloidish\"", but also not entirely trustworthy when it comes to tabloid-style details about personal details. Given the vagueness of the text, it seems best not to use the information without a second source to verify. Thoughts? --'''
[Ckatz]: As it turns out, your IP address (76.77.66.130) resolves back to Insight, so I'll take that as proof that you are connected to the company. The image in question - [[:File:Safety Glass 2009.jpg]] - was uploaded on or around January 18th by [[User:Torigo]], who listed the source as the website <nowiki>kinopoisk.ru<\/nowiki>. If it is not publicly available, it would probably fail our requirements for \""fair use\"" and can thus be removed from the site if you wish. Please let me know and I will look into this matter further. --'''
[Ckatz]: As per the edit comment in the article text, and per the [[WP:EL|external links guideline]], ''\""Only add web sites for radio stations that do not have existing Wikipedia articles\""''. The stations that have Wikipedia articles already have those links in the respective articles; as we are not a directory service, we do not repeat the links in the list article. Hope this helps. --'''
[Ckatz]: Please read through the talk page archives, as it will help to explain this common misunderstanding. \""Main character\"" status is decided by the network and the series producer, ''not'' by the opinions of fans or Wikipedia editors. The roles of Sylar and Ando were not considered \""main\"" roles in the first season, but both actors were promoted to that status in the second season. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... FYI, I would advise you to self-revert your recent edit, as it places you beyond the [[WP:3RR|three-revert rule]] guideline. The IP is obviously not going to stop; I'm going to file a notice at [[WP:ANI]]. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Ben, thanks for your note. I would be curious to know who you emailed, as there is no \""head of music\"" at Wikipedia. (The entire site is run as a collaborative effort.) Beyond that, the external links guideline generally suggests that we do not link to sites just because they mention a particular subject; there must be a specific benefit to the article. Many, many websites publish reviews, but that does not mean that ''every'' review site should be listed. Is there any particular reason why you feel \""Sun on the Sand\"" is especially notable? (Keep in mind that this is ''not'' a comment on the quality of the site, only a question as to why it should be one of the few that do get listed.) --'''
[Ckatz]: Done - thanks for sorting that out! Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Reverted; unfortunately this is a tough one to stop as the IP changes so frequently. Thanks. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the note... I've cleaned up the unnecessary ones, and also left a note for the editor. --'''
[Ckatz]: Fair enough, and your efforts are certainly appreciated. I have as requested posted an AfD, and added a note outlining your efforts and your interest in seeking input. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks. Good work on sourcing more material to support the article. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello, and thanks for the note. Unfortunately, what you have to remember is that Wikipedia is not a site for introducing products, or for any sort of promotional campaigns. In order to qualify for an article, a product has to demonstrate notability independently of the mere fact it exists. If you have any reviews from suitable sources (PC World, IGN etc.) that can support the product as being distinct or exceptional, that would help. --'''
[Ckatz]: I've repeatedly asked you to explain why you feel it is necessary to add that detail ''twice'' within close proximity. While we disagree on its validity in the RfC, I at least compromised and left one instance. I would ask the same courtesy in return. --'''
[Ckatz]: Actually, if you look at other pages, the standard is ''not'' to list individual schools as you did. I have expanded the section, but the individual schools are adequately listed on the linked \""North Vancouver School District\"" article. --'''
[Ckatz]: Fair enough. However, can you provide a reference that supports your assertion that L&O guest stars are primarily from that world, as opposed to the broader one? (That would alleviate my concerns.) --'''
[Ckatz]: Sorry, I wasn't clear enough. Do you have anything to verify that, of the L&O guests who have a theatrical background, most are from \""legitimate theatre\""? Otherwise, there is no reason to use the more specific term as opposed to the more inclusive \""theatre\"". --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for looking into that. I'll keep an eye on them as well. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for your question. The note was not regarding the information you added to that particular article, where you used the interview as a reference. It was about the other seven links you added to various \""External links\"" sections, which did not meet the [[WP:EL|guideline]]. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the follow-up. With regards to the Vancouver page, in the absence of any references I'm presuming that it just spread from one page to the next until noticed. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Please note that the change occurred prior to the discussion, not after it. As well, it is the other articles that are out of line with the wider convention across television articles. I have provided several links that explain this. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks, I was wondering what was happening there. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the notice. I'm off-line until Sunday night, so I suppose I'll see it then. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Shaheenjim, the edit is obviously disputed, given that more people have objected to it (and removed it) than have supported inclusion. As such, per any number of Wiki quidelines, the onus is on you to ''achieve'' consensus *first* rather than to restore the material without consensus. --'''
[Ckatz]: Umm, would you care to explain how ''I'' am edit warring? Last time I checked [[Moon]]'s history, you are the one who has repeatedly restored your text without consensus to do so, given that three editors (myself, PhySusie, and most recently Rracecarr) have objected to it this morning alone. --'''
[Ckatz]: I've been quite clear about the need for more discussion on this text, which is a valid reason for removing material; I've been equally clear in ''moving'' it to the talk page, rather than just \""deleting\"" it as you claim. Given the objections of others to your restoration of the material in its present form, that seems the appropriate course of action. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the note. Sorry too - I thought I ''had'' left you a note, but it seems I didn't. Must have been the late hour! Thanks again. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the note. The text doesn't seem necessary for the main articles about these provinces and states. (I think a couple of other editors have also removed it or moved it to the talk page in some cases.) I've only removed it from the more general articles; it seems better suited to the ones I left, such as those on the lakes themselves and on tourism. --'''
[Ckatz]: Oops, removed one from a \""Lake\"" article; I've restored that. --'''
[Ckatz]: No, not spam for sure. However, I'd suggest giving editors a chance to respond at the talk page where another editor moved the text... it was one of the US states if I recall correctly. As for the idea of providing tourism information, there is a difference between tourism and encyclopedic content. Believe me, I can understand the importance of the Lakes to the local states and provinces... after all, British Columbia's tourism industry is one of its top employers. However, the main article ([[British Columbia]])doesn't list the tourism routes. --'''
[Ckatz]: FYI, with regards to this site, there have been a series of [[WP:SPA|single-purpose accounts]] created exclusively to add links to it. At this point, it should be considered spam unless you see some value to it. Thanks. --'''
[Ckatz]: As I said, the material (all text, not just an EL) was removed because it did not seem necessary for the main article. It is better suited to a sub-article instead. As well, other editors have questioned the appropriateness of the text for similar reasons; SandyGeorgia removed it from the [[Minnesota]] article, to which someone else commented : ''\""It was out of place in Geography, unneeded for a high-level, overview article like this, and the target article is completely undeveloped. It was properly removed; thanks.\""'' Look, the information is useful - just not everywhere that you placed it. I would think that it is best suited to the articles on the Lakes and the Saint Lawrence River, which is why I didn't remove it from those articles. --'''
[Ckatz]: Your spurious accusations of \""vandalism\"" to the contrary, the links do not appear to meet the requirements Wikipedia outlines in the various guidelines covering sources and links. As well, much if not all of the text removed appeared to serve little purpose other than as a rationale for including a link to your sites. As for the links, they again did not appear to meet the requirements. --'''
[Ckatz]: Ryan has stated that he does not want threaded comments in the for\/against areas; hence his cleanup earlier today. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks, I appreciate it - fixed things right up. (Not sure what happened, as the header is generated by the 'bot.) --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks - I've always wondered how to do that. --'''
[Ckatz]: The difference here is that this is a ''British Columbia'' template, not just a Vancouver one. (Even if it were just Vancouver, there's a big difference between Detroit Windsor and Vancouver\/Bellingham.) There are some other reasons; I'll add more later (ASAP) to better explain, but have to go offline for a short while (sorry). --'''
[Ckatz]: Hey, thanks for the offer. From what I've just read, there seems to be a dispute as to how to number the individual stories, and whether the \""Shada\"" story should be counted. The consensus ''appears'' to be with the existing numbering, given that a similar renumbering by an IP was reverted a short time ago. We'll see what happens after the editor reaches the end of the list; if her restarts, some other action may be required. --'''
[Ckatz]: FYI, I have reverted your last edits to the RfC. You may not have realized this, but the poll was closed and the page was edit protected. I'm not sure if you want to repost your comment to the talk page; I didn't want to just do so without checking with you first. --'''
[Ckatz]: Sorry if I wasn't clear... the poll was already closed, so the comments ''can't'' be added to the page. By \""repost\"", I meant posting them on the associated talk page (or the poll's talk page). Once the poll was closed and protected, no-one can add to it, even if the admin bit allows us access. --'''
[Ckatz]: Walter, that's not it at all... there had not been any discussion since March 27, and there was no apparent consensus to merge. Perhaps Cmjc80 should have requested outside advice, but the fact that he closed it after 17 days of inactivity is not comparable to your stated intent to \""close merger discussions that I feel are not going the way I like\"". --'''
[Ckatz]: Fasach Nua, you know full well that the images were not ''added''; instead, they were restored from deletions by ''you'', all of which were without any form of explanation whatsoever. (One of your edits even broke the formatting for an article's infobox, an error that you did not correct when you reverted me.) Again, as per what I and others have told you repeatedly, you would probably find that your concerns receive a more positive response if you took the time to engage in discussion, rather than just deleting without even explaining why you are doing so. --'''
[Ckatz]: Please do not misrepresent the situation. You deleted material, you did not explain why, you did not provide an edit summary, and you refuse to participate in any form of discussion about the deletions. FN, I'm presuming that your intentions are good. However, you must keep in mind that the behaviour I've described above - if taken by an IP or an editor without a good track record - would be considered vandalism. Please reconsider your refusal to explain your edits; I am certainly not the only editor to take issue with this problem. --'''
[Ckatz]: You may wish to review my previous post; that is where I specifically stated ''\""FN, I'm presuming that your intentions are good.\""'' --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... you asked about this a while back, and I replied on the dates talk page, asking if people wanted the section unprotected. (The section was isolated and protected when consensus was reached to unlock everything ''except'' for that section.) Following the request, there was no consensus to ''unlock'' the section, especially while the arbitration case is still under way. Hope this helps. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the note. Unfortunately, you need to supply a citation from a reliable source that indicates there actually is a controversy ovewr this. WE can't publish opinions. Please feel free to ask if you need more information about this. Thanks again. --'''
[Ckatz]: Being \""possibly the only dissenting viewpoint at the time\"" does not make the site or its opinion notable. --'''
[Ckatz]: It's not, and thank you for pointing it out. Per our [[WP:EL|guideline for external links]], Wikipedia is not a directory service. Please note that this should in no way be interpreted as a comment on the quality of either your web site or your competitor's. Simply put, it is a reflection of the consensus reached regarding what sites should and should not be listed. Thanks again. --'''
[Ckatz]: Locke, I'm undoing ''your'' action and asking you to please stay out of it. If there is a problem either way, you are best off allowing the clerks to handle it - that is their job after all. They will either revert HWV258's actions, or remove Pmanderson's comments. I mean you no disrespect, but there really is no need for you to intervene (and it would be best given the tensions that are prevalent if you did not). --'''
[Ckatz]: I'm not assessing either HMV258 or Pmanderson's actions, as that is the clerk's domain. Neither am I interested in taking sides. However, in this situation, you are clearly a third party intervening where you should not. There is enough drama on the pages associated with this matter; please let the clerks do their job, without muddying the waters. --'''
[Ckatz]: I don't feel comfortable removing the proposals, given that it is an ArbCom page. However, I have left a comment stating that I feel it ''should'' be removed. Hope this helps. --'''
[Ckatz]: No harm done. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Found [[User:B_ngwarrior]] in the \""new user\"" log... safe bet that this is yet another \""fan\"". The account is now blocked, but I thought I'd leave you a note in case it (by some unrealistically small chance) is valid. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hammersoft, I appreciate your taking the time to reply, and I have reviewed the above cases. One thing that became immediately clear is that this block is '''in no way whatsoever''' even remotely similar to the incidents you have referenced. Those cases involved editors (admins) who had been, and remained, directly involved in the articles in question. They had participated in the pages, they were content contributors, and they used their bit to their advantage. The \""Wolf426\"" IP issue here involves the reversal of the repeated deletion of properly referenced material by a single-purpose IP editor. I had no part in the original posting of that material, I had not contributed content to the article, and I had no prior involvement with the IP. My only prior edits to the page involved a few minor style guide issues, so to say I was an \""active\"" editor on the page or that I \""frequented\"" the page is completely incorrect. There is no parallel here at all - as supported by the comments at the AN\/I review, wherein at least two other admins have stated that my actions were appropriate given the IP's actions. I could understand your point if I had actually contributed any content to the article, or been a part of the creation process there - but I was not. Again, I appreciate your input, but we will have to agree to disagree with regards to your assertions. --'''
[Ckatz]: No problem - the rationale is that we generally avoid \""crystal-ball\"" type categories and tags. The series may be ''scheduled'' to go into the 2010s, and it probably ''will'' do that, but until it actually happens... For the same reason, we don't update episode counts until a new episode actually airs, and we list series as \""present\"" rather than a future, scheduled end date. Hope this helps. --'''
[Ckatz]: Anyhow, not sure it was a \""major edit\"", as I was really just trimming and rearranging to pass the time after reverting the spam link. However, since you brought it up, the express details probably aren't needed there either; the article was\/still is a bit heavy on minute details that are probably better left to either a comparison table or the software's FAQ pages. (Any thoughts on [[Google Notebook]], seeing as how I was there as well?) Thanks in advance. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... thanks for your input, and I do appreciate your concerns. However, I do have to take issue with certain aspects of what you wrote, given that I believe they do not accurately represent the event in question. I, too, am uninvolved in the articles in question, other than noticing and reverting an IP identified '''by another admin''' (Hiberniantears) as a likely sock of a previously blocked editor. The move to protect the page against a disruptive IP's actions was following an identical move by Hiberniantears, so I do not know why I was singled out in this case. Anyway, to reiterate, I do think that your reverts were in error (sorry to say) and that the situation should have been investigated in greater detail before you simply reverted two other admins. Just my two cents, though. --'''

[Ckatz]: Again, we'll have to agree to disagree. Looking at the matter as an outsider, I felt that the merge seemd appropriate, and that the IP's actions were disruptive. This is demonstrated by the fact that the IP is repeatedly restoring an external link that does not seem appropriate per [[WP:EL]], within hours of when you unprotected the page. The edit summary said \""per discussion\"", yet no discussion endorsed such a move, mirroring similar arguments by this IP at [[Micronations]]. Thoughts? --'''

[Ckatz]: Or, one could see it as a single-purpose editor (based on contributions, and whom another admin has suggested is an IP sock) who is unhappy with the removal of something he or she wants in, and is trying to get their way. Methods include multiple reverts, misleading statements, and discounting solutions (such as DMOZ) that have long been accepted as practical alternatives for EL-related issues. Orderinchaos, if you want to take over this issue, fine. I'd appreciate it though if you could review this IP's contributions, and (more importantly) ''monitor'' the articles as I strongly suspect this is not the end of the problem. --'''

[Ckatz]: Further to this, I find the IP's criticism of DMOZ (''\""DMOZ is very limited resource that links to a handful of websites.\""'') questionable, especially given that the DMOZ page offers 137 links categorized by region and other subject areas. Given that anyone is free to request that links are added to DMOZ (negating the \""out of date\"" claim), it would appear that the  primary reason for the IP's claim is simply that DMOZ doesn't list ''his'' preferred site. The DMOZ link does far more to assist providing a broader perspective that a solitary link to one site, and the IP is far better off submitting it to DMOZ than persisting in disruptive behaviour here. Just my two cents. --'''

[Ckatz]: I've been monitoring Commons, and it appears the file attribution has now been adjusted to allay his\/her concerns. That would seem to address the issue. --'''
[Ckatz]: The error lies in referring to the line as being two lines, and in describing it as the \""third and fourth lines\"" in the area. All Translink information describes the Canada Line as a singular line, and it is not up to us to reinterpret it as \""two lines\"". Furthermore, your description in the lead incorrectly gave the impression that there were two distinct lines totalling 30.2 km of track. --'''
[Ckatz]: Any revised wording would still have to reflect the \""one line\"" concept, as that is how the line will be described (and though of) by the public. Translink is (in all likelihood) going to be describing runs as \""Canada Line to Richmond-Brighouse\"" and \""Canada Line to YVR-Airport\"", as this would mirror what they do with the other lines. I have reworked the lead to reflect the main\/branch\/length issues. --'''
[Ckatz]: The previous version was structured better. If you wish to mention the arcs, I would suggest integrating them into the existing season-by-season format and trimming that down. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... thanks for the note. Unfortunately, I didn't have the time to finish earlier, and I suspect you may not prefer the rewrite that I've since done. The reality is that we are obligated to include what is said about the film, even if it is negative, as this is an encyclopedia article. I understand that it may be difficult for the cast and crew, but that is what what is required by Wikipedia's policies of neutrality. Please feel free to ask if you have any questions about this. --'''
[Ckatz]: Abel, the concerns I expressed about your edits are based on your previous posts, where you have indicated a desire to avoid the negative press. As for the article, we ''cannot'' ignore what has been said about the film. If it were only one bad review in a sea of praise, perhaps - but look at the comments from the major press that we didn't use:<blockquote>''\""About as cruddy as a cruddy little indie can get, especially given a cast that should've known better. \""'' (''Chicago Tribune'')<\/blockquote><blockquote>''\""[Director] Glatzer aims to wring laughter out of this desperation but succeeds only in producing a series of contrived characters and situations that make The Breakfast Club look like an unfiltered documentary.\""'' (''LA Times'')<\/blockquote><blockquote>''\""An unusually subdued Coogan does his best, but this is the kind of pretentious nonsense he usually satirizes.\""'' (''New York Daily News'')<\/blockquote><blockquote>''\""Mr. Coogan doesn't seem altogether comfortable with his part, which, like the story, undergoes a number of unconvincing changes.\""'' (''New York Times'')<\/blockquote><blockquote>''\""Without a trace of tempo or one shred of narrative pacing, What Goes Up is not really a movie; it's the cheapest kind of amateurishness that looks like it was shot with a cell phone. \""'' (''New York Observer'')<\/blockquote>Obviously, we're not here to trash a film - but we also cannot selectively pick-and-choose reviews that only cast it in a positive light. As such, I ''strongly'' encourage you to discuss future changes on the article's talk page instead of simply reverting. Otherwise, we run the risk of this devolving into an edit war. If you remain unconvinced as to the role Wikipedia plays in  covering material, we can certainly seek additional input regarding the article. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the note. I noticed that, but given that the micronation was more popular in terms of Google hits, the fact that the hatnote was an aside from someone opposed to even ''having'' the micronation article, and that the house doesn't appear especially notable outside of the US (at least, as compared to the micronation) the present arrangement seemed best. Thoughts? --'''
[Ckatz]: You're welcome to disagree, of course, but I felt it was ''equally'' fair to correct what appeared to be an improper decision to move the micronation article and replace it with one about a building. The correct procedure would have been to move the micronation article as done, create [[Wirtland (building)]], and use [[Wirtland]] as a disambiguation page for those two articles. I've proposed just such a move at the move discussion you opened. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the note; I've cleaned up the page per your request. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Blocked, edits removed, and I've asked for the URLs to be added to the blacklist at Meta. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: I was wondering if it was a straight revert, given the wide range of changes (many of which did not fit the edit summary). Good work on tracking down the older version. Given what you've said, is there any point in me sifting through the changes, or should I just leave it for the page regulars? --'''
[Ckatz]: I've replied on your talk page, but in a nutshell, you have to stop adding the link. As the site owner, you are in a conflict of interest - and as an editor here, you are not following the consensus process. Two separate editors have disagreed with your link, yet you continue to restore it, which is a real problem. You are far better off offering your knowledge on the talk page where it can be properly assessed. --'''
[Ckatz]: As mentioned, there are issues with the writing style, the organization, and other aspects. The lead paragraph was much stronger in its previous incarnation, whereas the revised one appears somewhat unfocused. I've just come online for today, and will be able to actually sit down and give an in-depth read-through later on. --'''
[Ckatz]: With all due respect, I have briefly expressed my concerns; as well, it does take a certain period of uninterrupted time to review and note the full extent of the issues. Apologies if it is not fast enough, but I've a lot on my plate right now. However, I will say that - while your efforts are certainly appreciated - I do feel that the rewrite has sufficient issues with it that we are better off keeping the original in place and ''adapting'' parts of the rewrite, rather than the other way around. I won't be able to give it a solid read for a few days yet, but if that doesn't work for you than I can assist in calling for a third opinion. (Probably the best bet is to post at the Television project talk page, given that ''X-Files '' has been out of production for a while.) --'''
[Ckatz]: The pages were compared, and the immediate impression was that the old one was better off as the \""current\"" version, to be used as a base. The revised lead was very problematic, and some of the reordering also appeared to be that way. There were also quite a few references that were removed as \""dead links\"", whereas the usual practise is to ''tag'' them as dead links while retaining the information. --'''
[Ckatz]: RT and Metacritic have established notability as aggregate review sites, and as such are considered to add value to article content from that perspective. Simply put, Wikipedia benefits more from the use than the site does. The case is reversed for individual sites that have ''not'' established notability independently, as they receive far more of a boost from being mentioned here than Wikipedia's articles do by including their content. While I can understand your concern at having your site rejected in favour of a competitor's (although the roles are somewhat different), you have to remember that we are not looking at it from the same perspective. --'''
[Ckatz]: Sorry for the delay in responding, as I've been off-line for a few weeks. (I've also replied to this matter at [[User talk:Kingwarren]].) Please note that your claims that this is related to any sort of \""personal problem\"" with you are completely unfounded, and that I did not actually block your account. I did, however, notice an apparent similarity between the various accounts involved, especially given the focus on specific content and the timing, and as such I requested a standard check to get an opinion from the editors who specialize in that aspect of Wikipedia's operations. This is a straightforward process that is requested frequently when situations such as this arise. It is important to remember that the decision is based on their independent assessment of your contributions, ''not'' simply because I raised the question. If you wish to take issue with their conclusions, you'll need to take it up with them. --'''
[Ckatz]: Sorry, didn't see that note. I'll take a look at the page. Cheers, and thanks for following up on this. --'''
[Ckatz]: If there's consensus regarding the format, it shouldn't be a problem if people wish to restore the previous version (essentially, undoing the changes). --'''
[Ckatz]: Now ''that'' is great service. Thanks for addressing this so quickly. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: You are incorrect in presuming that \""there for some time\"" equates to a right to be there. The links fail the \""what not to include\"" section, and are not necessary given the presence of professional sources. --'''
[Ckatz]: Sigh... --'''
[Ckatz]: Please note the supposed \""vandalism\"" consisted of removing a single link repeatedly spammed by rolling IPs that are likely connected to the site. The site's owner is also a (former) Wikipedia editor, and the site has never been deemed worthy for use as a reference source.

[Ckatz]: The fact that MGM is broadcasting repeats of its own production is not notable; in fact, one would ''expect'' them to do so. (It would only be notable if they were producing new episodes that were first broadcast on This TV.) Keep in mind that the series is in syndication on ''many'' networks, and Wikipedia is not a television guide. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the note; he seems to have left the most recent one in place. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: In short, the post is being reverted because it does not meet Wikipedia's Manual of Style, and introduces excessive detail and trivia into the article. I'll try to add some links for you to read later this evening. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hey, thanks for the note. No problem at all - I've done that before as well. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Ah, sorry - thought I'd commented on that. The planet (etc.) articles don't use astrological symbols in that manner, so they were reverted from the lead sentence. Sorry for the inconvenience. --'''
[Ckatz]: Again, we are not a directory service. Many quality sites do not have links, specifically because we try to avoid giving preferential treatment. Keep in mind that this is not a knock against your particular site, but instead a reflection of the established consensus with regards to links, which we try to keep to a minimum. Furthermore, there are several issues that complicate this, most notably that you have repeatedly ''restored'' the links without seeking consensus to do so, and that you are adding the links despite having a direct conflict of interest in doing so. Given your relationship with the site, you cannot add links to it, and would have to convince other editors of the site's merits in order to see if they feel it warrants inclusion. --'''
[Ckatz]: The text benefits the companies you've listed, but not the article. I think you'd be hard-pressed to argue that Pickled Productions is anywhere near comparable to Apple, Fox, and Chase Bank. --'''
[Ckatz]: This comes up every so often; sourced or not, the convention is that we only update season and episode counts in the infobox ''after an episode airs''. (The \""sourced' bit you've mentioned is more relevant to series such as ''Firefly'', which was cancelled before all of the episodes aired. In that case, the sources justify listing more than what actually aired.) --'''
[Ckatz]: No, we would put \""1\"" (or \""2\"", however many air). The following week, \""3\"", and so on. Look, I understand your confusion as the doc isn't too clear, but the established convention as used on all series articles is that we update only based on aired episodes. That is why changes prior to air are reverted immediately, as there are too many variables that can affect a scheduled airdate. Will it air at that day and time? Realistically, of courcse. However, we have no way of knowing if an unexpected event (natural or man-made) will occur and disrupt scheduling, so we wait. --'''
[Ckatz]: Listen, I don't know how many times I have to say this: '''what you are proposing is contrary to the established practice for the infobox'''. If you're not convinced by my explanations, please refer to the recent discussions at the Television project, where this came up a few days back with regards to the ''Cleveland Show''. As with your case, there were references indicating a planned run of \""x\"" episodes. However, despite that, the convention is to ''only'' list aired episodes in the infobox, with the other details going in the body copy. (With respect to your example, no \""20 (2 aired)\"", just \""2\"".) Other points raised include the fact that while 20 episodes may be planned for, they are not all actually ''produced'' as of yet. If the series is cancelled during its run, several of these episodes may never even be scripted or shot. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hey, thanks for the question. Unfortunately, in this case, it is a site that appears to have been spammed across just about any article the site's people could get away with. There were over 150 links to the site when I first noticed it, many of which were spammed by an IP in 2008 and a single-purpose editor in the past few days. Many of the links were added as \""references\"" to basic information that should come from more reliable sources, while other links were used to replace existing links from government sources. Hope this helps. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... please do not restore the link to the \""procon\"" site. Links to this site have been added en masse by single-purpose accounts and IPs, such as [[User:Proconorg]] and others. In some cases, these accounts have deleted valid government sources in favour of their own URLs. Thank you. --'''
[Ckatz]: I fail to see how this exchange is \""impolite\""; if anything, your replies to date have been far more provocative than mine. I've removed these links as an administrative action, one that was begun after noting the suspicious pattern in which they were, for the most part, added. There is no reason for you to issue \""warnings\"" and make spurious claims regarding politeness, as you have done. Furthermore, keep in mind that the spammed site was tagged onto the line ''\""Prostitution in Germany is legal along with brothel ownership\""''. There is no reason why this text cannot be referenced from an official government source. --'''
[Ckatz]: You are apparently ignoring the explanations I've already provided, the indication that there has been a concerted effort to spam this site, the fact that the information in question can easily be sourced from what would be a more appropriate source anyway, and the assessment by a second admin that site is not suitable as a reference. --'''
[Ckatz]: Problem is, the site has a demonstrated history of being spammed over a period stretching back at least a year. In such cases, it is desirable to avoid using the site at all. From what I've seen, the text it has been used to reference can all be replaced with more appropriate, more direct, and non-spammed sites. --'''
[Ckatz]: Again, by \""being spammed\"", I mean that there are several IP and SPA accounts whose edits consist solely of adding links to the ProCon site on a host of articles. When I first discovered the links, there were well over 150 of them. Many were in the external links sections, added one after another by the same account. Others were tossed into articles on text tha tcould easily be sourced more directly, or (in some cases) even used to replace more direct sources. Are some added by well-intentioned editors? In all likelihood, yes. However, based on what I have seen, these are a tiny minority of the total number of links, compared to the huge list of spammed links. Assuming good faith is important, of course, but when an account's entire history involves nothing other than adding ProCon links, and when those same format links appear throughout other articles, AGF has its limits in the face of a definite effort to spam the links. --'''
[Ckatz]: I've commented on the talk page, but I'll add here that the \""job\"" quote cannot be used to speculate about his job security, just as we cannot use the \""creepy\"" comment. Nor can we speculate about CBS and their policies, or Letterman's status with regards to those policies. Simply put, a lot of details with regards to this matter may well be better suited to Wikinews, as we have to look at the bigger picture to determine what is news and what is encyclopedic. --'''
[Ckatz]: Catherine, the use as you added it implies there is an issue with his job status. There is no evidence to suggest that, and we are not here to speculate, imply, or any other such task. If you are adamant about the line, get consensus on the talk page - but you need to do that ''before'' restoring it. --'''
[Ckatz]: With respect to the IPs, it's not a question of \""more than I would like\"". It is instead the ''fact'' that several IPs and accounts came to Wikipedia ''for no other purpose'' than to add dozens and dozens of links to the ProCon site. Furthermore, many of those links were added as external links in a manner contrary to what is permitted under the external links guideline, or used to replace existing references that in some cases were to more direct sources. It is a simple reality that any time you have a site that is being spammed by single-purpose accounts, or an editor whose primary role on Wikipedia involves promoting or using one particular source, you have to take a very close look at the site. In this case, the site itself is questionable as a reference source; any material they post without explanations of where they sourced it can't be verified by us, and any information they post from referenced sources should really be sourced here to that primary source (rather than the ProCon intermediary). --'''
[Ckatz]: The problem lies in the fact that the material is unreferenced. You may say that it is true - and it may well be true - but Wikipedia requires sources that can be verified by readers. If you can provide proof from [[WP:RS|reliable, verifiable sources]], then it would help in allowing the material to remain. --'''
[Ckatz]: Actually, you are the one who needs to stop your repeated efforts to add Wu-related material to articles where it does not belong. The ''class' of vehicle is relevant, but the ''make'' is completely irrelevant to the story, as evidenced by the news article you've linked to. (In the ''Times'' article, \""SUV\"" is mentioned four times, in the headline and the first, third and ninth paragraphs, whereas \""Yukon\"" is only a passing mention in paragraph seven.) Note that your terminology (\""self-described \""environmentalists\"") strongly suggests a POV on your part, one that cannot form a part of an article. --'''
[Ckatz]: You are more than welcome to open discussion regarding the matter on the article's talk page. However, I would point out that you are making several presumptions in your statements that are not grounded in fact. First and foremost, please do not presume that anyone who does not embrace your perspective on the matter is trying to cover something up, or that they hold an opposing view with regards to Wu. Simply put, an article was being repeatedly changed by IPs whose edits served only to further one and the same purpose, that is to add material only tangentially related to the subject of the article. Secondly, note that no-one is \""challenging the matter's worthiness to be included\"" in the ''Wu'' article, where it belongs. However, the focus of the controversy is not that Wu specifically drives a Yukon, but that ''he'' drives a SUV when making statements about environmental issues. The make of the SUV does not matter; for that matter, the fact he drives an SUV is irrelevant to the ''article'' about SUVs, and as such we don't add details on Wu to that article either. Beyond that, you were repeatedly adding the material despite being advised it was not appropriate to this article, a pattern that was proving disruptive to the article. Hence, semi-protection. If you can achieve consensus to add the material here, it can certainly return - but keep in mind that you would have to convince others that ''this'' abstract reference to a Yukon is more relevant than any other cultural reference to it. --'''
[Ckatz]: If you have concerns, discuss them on the article's talk page, so that all editors can participate. As for your actions, I must say that your decision to go through my recent contributions and look for problems with them is an interesting course of action. It may not, however, help you in your desire to appear innocent in all of this. --'''
[Ckatz]: FYI, it's not an article, it's a redirect page that you've proposed for conversion to a disambiguation page. So far, the serious arguments seem to lean toward keeping the redirect; the 24.* IP is just a disgruntled IP that is hounding my edits, and another editor has already commented that the entries you've proposed aren't especially necessary. Myself, I don't care either way what the page is, as long as proper procedure is followed. That is why I'm acting in an administrative role there, rather than as an editor with a particular preference. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... thanks for the note. You raise some valid points - and personally, I don't really care either way. (Keep in mind that I'm Canadian, so I use \""tire\"", not \""tyre\"".) However, the important consideration here is that per [[WP:ENGVAR]] we don't arbitrarily change the spelling of an article without discussion first, and (more importantly) in the case of ''this'' article, the title uses \""tyre\"". We would not change the spelling of the article without first changing the title to \""slick tire\"". If you feel strongly about the spelling, you are welcome to open a discussion to move the page and change the spelling. I can provide tips if you like, but it should not be done before such a discussion is complete. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: The categories have already been vetted through a [[Wikipedia:Categories for discussion\/Log\/2009 June 13#Category:2010s American television series|deletion debate]], and the resulting consensus was to keep them. These are not \""possible\"" categories, they definitely will be populated (as are their predecessors). --'''
[Ckatz]: All anyone needs to do is to look at your contribution history, which parallels mine. Funny how you \""just happen\"" to edit articles I've edited, in many cases in exactly the same order I've edited them in. Funny, too, how that pattern appears to be transferring itself from your IP account to your shiny new registered account. (I could, of course, just be paranoid. I'm sure it is just a complete and utter coincidence that you chose to edit [[Jackie Tyler]], [[arachnophobia]] and [[flashlight]] earlier today as 24.dot, or [[J.D. (Scrubs)]], [[click-through rate]] and [[Quebec City]] under your IP account on the 14th, each of those edits immediately following mine in the respective article histories.) --'''
[Ckatz]: Actually, I've never said you shouldn't make the specific edits. More to the point, if you had come across the articles in a purely random manner, or through a normal progression of editing, I wouldn't have anything to complain about. The troublesome factor lies in the way you are obviously monitoring the contributions list of an editor you've had a disagreement with, and then following that editor around the project to edit the same articles. You can attempt to dismiss this with more spurious claims, as you have done previously, but a simple comparison of our respective contribution histories will demonstrate my concerns regarding your activities on Wikipedia. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hmmm. Thanks for the tip. Glancing through that archive, it seems to support the use of Talkorigins as a RS when the cite is to a particular article and the author can be verified. However, the page I reviewed is a FAQ with no indication as to where the material comes form. If you have a chance to look over the page in question, I'd appreciate your thoughts on it. Thanks in advance. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thank you for your note. Unfortunately, Wikipedia has some very strict guidelines with respect to the use of external sites as either references or external links. The \""TVonMedia\"" site does not meet the requirements of our [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] guideline, and we do not generally permit [[WP:EL|external links]] to sites unless they provide a definitive benefit to the article. This should not be misinterpreted as a slight against the site; simply put, there are millions of web sites around the planet, and we cannot act as a directory service for them. As such, I would ask that you avoid adding links to the TVonMedia site. You are, of course, encouraged to contribute to the site in other ways. Please feel free to ask more questions if you would like. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Please see the preceding note, which explains why the URLs are not suitable for inclusion. --'''
[Ckatz]: It is unfortunate that you feel that way, but our guidelines on external links exist for a good reason, and they are based on years of discussion and debate. You are certainly welcome to contribute in other ways, of course. --'''
[Ckatz]: Such as [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Talk:Pluto&curid=186148&diff=325454401&oldid=325400085 this edit summary]... classic. Cheers, and thanks for the laugh. --'''
[Ckatz]: While it may seem confusing, you need to understand that Wikipedia does not treat fictional works as being \""in the moment\"". A series is viewed in its entirety, and as such we list ''all'' actors who have had main character status at any point during the run of the series. We do not use \""former\"" or similar subsections, and likewise we do not write about characters who have died or otherwise left as being in the past tense. This is a standard across all fictional works. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for sourcing references for the 9th season so quickly. Nice work. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for pointing this out. The user has been warned accordingly. --'''
[Ckatz]: Likewise. I can't give a firm time commitment, but I do have the page watchlisted (but of course...) and am always reviewing changes. Cheers, and thanks for taking this on. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hey, thanks very much, Hu. Very kind of you indeed. And, of course, thanks to you in return for your tireless work on the spam frontier. Cheers! --'''
[Ckatz]: Merci. I appreciate the information. --'''
[Ckatz]: You've pasted the same text into multiple articles, you've placed it in the lead (as opposed to properly integrating it into the body of the articles), and the text needs a rewrite to avoid what appears to be exaggerated language. In addition, a review of your contributions revealed some history of issues with POV and lack of discussion prior to contentious edits. If you wish to post the material, the best route would be to discuss it first. --'''
[Ckatz]: Per the editor who redirected this article back in March 2009, the page is little more than a track listing and fails the guidelines established by the Music project. --'''
[Ckatz]: I've provided links to the relevant policies and guidelines on your talk page. In a nutshell, Wikipedia is not a directory service; the simple fact that a link ''exists'' is not reason to link to it. --'''
[Ckatz]: Kheider, I hate having to do this, but I've removed the text for now until it can be further discussed. Having looked at the forum you referenced, it really felt as if Wikipedia was giving the concept far more weight than the discussions actually warranted. Even though it was Alan Stern mentioning the idea, we've no indication that he would support what was written. For all we know, it was just some people tossing around ideas. That aside, if we can track down more material to support the idea, it might well make for an interesting addition. Thoughts? --'''
[Ckatz]: I've re-reworked that section, and would also appreciate it if it could remain stable until we resolve this. Your changes there (and in other ocean articles) are problematic in that they suggest the Southern Ocean is still a \""work in progress\"", when in fact it is an active concept in use by the IHO and other world bodies. Any changes would need to reflect that fact, which is evidenced by the IHO's working groups, other marine organizations, and even the CIA World Factbook, all of which use the Southern Ocean terminology. (You are correct in that the 1953 guide does not include the Southern Ocean, but the problem lies in that your rewrites suggest the Southern Ocean term will not take effect until the 4th editon is published, which does not reflect the actual use today.) Given that the Oceans project has already seen fit to implement the Southern Ocean, it would help if we could seek consensus for the best wording on all the ocean articles ''before'' making changes of the nature you have done to date. (As it is, there is now also a fair bit of rewording necessary in the changes you've made to the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Ocean articles.) --'''
[Ckatz]: Where was it stated that the CIA publication isn't considered a reliable source? It's certainly in widespread use as a reference source in many articles across the project, and I can't see any discussions at [[Wikipedia:Reliable_sources\/Noticeboard|the WP:RS noticeboard]] that conclude it is unreliable. (The topic has certainly been brought up, for example [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources\/Noticeboard\/Archive 18#The CIA taken as an Authority|here]], [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources\/Noticeboard\/Archive 3#CIA - The World Factbook|here]] and [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources\/Noticeboard\/Archive 9#CIA World Factbook and US Department of State|here]], but the consensus is that the book ''is'' an acceptable source.) --'''
[Ckatz]: I agree that the resolution of this lies in finding a way to present all aspects of the matter. With regard to the IHO, I'd disagree that that text should be completely removed from the lead. We have to consider the fact that they are the defining body for these matters. We certainly need to present conflicting viewpoints, but we also cannot merely lump them in as \""just another viewpoint\"". (This is similar to Pluto's recent re-categorization as a dwarf planet; while we present alternative views, the definition from the defining body - the IAU - is regarded as the scientific standard.) I think you've put forward some good ideas, though, and will try to respond to them in more detail later today. --'''
[Ckatz]: --'''
[Ckatz]: Sorry, but what?!? How exactly is it POV? They originally defined the Southern Ocean in the 2nd edition, removed it for various reasons in the 3rd, then voted (and passed) a motion to restore it in 2000. They have announced their intention to publish it in the upcoming 4th edition, and it is in use by them and by other reliable sources. Your rewrite strongly suggests the IHO does ''not'' officially endorse their own plans, which is not an accurate depiction of what is going on at all. While the 3rd edition is still active ''pending the introduction of the 4th'', the IHO has '''clearly''' demonstrated their intention to move forward with the reintroduction of the term, and other reputable international bodies have acknowledged this and are proceeding in a similar manner. Our wording must reflect this reality, not obscure it. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello, and thanks for the note. No offence taken at all, and no worries about etiquette - first-timers are as welcome as anyone else. As for the links, I thought I'd commented on it, but apparently not. Generally speaking, we avoid external links unless they add significantly to the article. As well, we do not use what are referred to as \""inline\"" external links; that is to say, regular copy in the body of an article that is marked up with an external link. (Yes, there are thousands of them in articles, but cleanup is a slow process...) External links are for the most part used only in \""External links\"" sections, references, and some infoboxes. As such, I've gone through the section you were working on and removed all of the external links. I've left the name of the store you added, though, as that is useful. (Thanks!) Please feel free to ask if you have more questions about this or any other aspect of the project. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: I've restored the previous version for now. (Apologies for being away from this for a few days.) While this discussion is moving along, the text is still not ready for implementation. Your version still has issues in that it strongly suggests the IHO doesn't support its own concept, which is not the case. Realistically, we need to research the status better; we know the Southern Ocean definition has passed a vote, and we know the 4th edition publication hasn't been ratified. The question is whether the lack of publication changes the status of the vote; does the IHO consider the Southern Ocean to be official at this time. Again, we need to hash this out - probably on the SO talk page for greater input - and then have an RfC to get more opinions (given that this has ramifications beyond just the one article.) --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... thanks for the note. With respect to the Letterman show, it is a creative work, and as such continues to exist as a body of work even if no new episodes are in production. We would only switch to past tense if all copies of said work were destroyed, in which case it would be considered to no longer exist. (In a similar vein, ''Citizen Kane'' \""is\"" a film and ''War and Peace'' \""is\"" a book, despite production having ceased on said works.) --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... thanks for the note. Spam, in this sense, referred to the way in which this identical material was used into a series of film articles by an IP editor, without providing any real context or benefit to any of them. The text merely notes that the film is one of 174 films that qualify to be ''considered'' for an award nomination, which is not notable. (All that means is that it was released within the correct time period, screened in the US, and so on, not that it has achieved some special status.) Hope this helps. --'''
[Ckatz]: Sorry, but I really do not appreciate such unfair accusations, especially since they do not accurately reflect the true nature of the situation. I can understand if you disagree, but from my perspective this was simply a matter of choosing the best path to avoid an undesirable outcome. As you are aware, a move discussion was held that led to the outcome that is presently in place. Keep in mind that this move discussion was closed by an administrator with '''far more experience''' in these matters than you or I. (In fact, that admin chooses to spent a vast majority of his time on Wikipedia \""specializing\"", if you will, in assessing the outcome of move discussions and the relevant consensus that develops.) If you have an issue with his decision, by all means take it up with him - or re-open the discussion, as I've repeatedly advised you to do. Regardless of my own perspective on the matter, my actions are based solely on maintaining an existing consensus. The alternative, doing nothing and waiting to see if you would cross the line with respect to 3RR, was not a viable option in my opinion; I would much prefer to try to allow the situation to cool down rather than see an established contributor move into a position where he ends up with a suspension of editing privileges. This is possible in situations such as [[The Sun]], where there is an extremely low number of edits; page protection in this case does not interfere with an actively edited page. Note, too, that the page protection is ''temporary'', not permanent; if you are prepared to agree to stop reverting against the existing consensus, and instead discuss the matter, I'd be amenable to opening up the page again. I'm also fine with pointing you toward places where you can seek a second opinion, if you wish, and will assist you in that respect if you so desire. --'''
[Ckatz]: Actually, Wikipedia uses \""Intrust\"" per our style guide. The company may choose to use all caps, but we use conventional grammar rules. --'''
[Ckatz]: Stuart - thank you for the note, and for correcting the matter. The text was probably initially reverted because of the external links that were added. Wikipedia has fairly stringent standards for external links, as outlined in the [[WP:EL|external links guideline]]. As such, i have had to remove the links you added today as well. Please do not take this as a commentary on the quality of your site; it is merely a reflection of the fact that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a directory service. Please feel free to ask if you have additional questions about hits matter. Thank you again. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thank you for your note. Unfortunately, the link has been removed because Wikipedia is not a directory service, and we do not exist merely to list other web sites. You've said that Execcomp is \""the leading place\"" for compensation information. Who, exactly, has identified it as such? What does the site offer that would benefit Wikipedia readers, and how is that benefit greater than the boost Execcomp would receive from being listed here? --'''
[Ckatz]: FYI, Po'buster has posted [[Wikipedia_talk:Canadian_Wikipedians'_notice_board#French_in_Infoboxes|here]] as well. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks, and good catch. I looked at the contribution, the user page, and other aspects of the account, and your assessment seems bang on. Please let me know if you come across other similar cases; this user seems quite persistent. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: You cannot write text about your own work, and reference it with your own pages; it is a [[WP:COI|conflict of interest]]. Keep in mind that this is not a commentary on the ''quality'' of your work, but a reflection of the need to have independent editors assess it for inclusion. --'''
[Ckatz]: Please see the detailed discussion regarding this matter on Tony1's talk page. Tony had noted his intention to modify his script to avoid the counterproductive removal of beneficial links while cleaning up overlinking, but the script changes appear to have not registered with the system. As such, the long list of changes continued to introduce more problems by removing beneficial links. As it is far easier to redo the valid script-based changes once the script is repaired than it is for other editors to manually edit each and every article to repair the errors, the appropriate course of action is to undo the problem edits until OTny1 can implement his proposed fixes. --'''
[Ckatz]: No problem, and thanks for asking. I'd thought I was adding comments to the changes, but apparently I wasn't - so your questions were certainly justified. Yes, the problem lies in the useful links - such as the NBC one you've mentioned - that are erroneously removed along with the legitimate changes. I've restored the ''Friends'' version, but have left the ST:TNG changes as per Tony1's version; after double-checking, it appears that no network info was lost in the shuffle. Thanks again. --'''
[Ckatz]: Unless you are planning on ensuring that the problems your script is introducing are all dealt with - problems that are detailed on your talk page - than your actions are merely creating extra work for other editors who then have to clean up after your changes. In addition, you have yet to address the same problems that were introduced into the ''previous'' batch of edit you made a few days back. --'''
[Ckatz]: Tony, as I've clearly and repeatedly outlined on your talk page, what you've described as a \""second pass\"" was in fact the result of errors introduced in the first pass. I clearly explained my actions on your talk page, I clearly outlined the rationale behind them, and I even offered to help. You may have good intentions, but if the script is introducing new problems at the same time it is correcting existing ones, then measures are needed to rectify the situation. I did ask you about this a day or so ago, when I posted ''\""your recent edits to dozens of television series articles have stripped out links to various television networks, links which are certainly relevant in articles about series produced by and for those networks.\""'' Unfortunately, you resumed use of the script without addressing the problems. Please note that the articles are certainly not going to suffer from a temporary delay in processing, whereas it is unrealistic to expect other editors to have to check over every article to clean up introduced problems. --'''
[Ckatz]: Since we're apparently doing \""warnings\"", you should note that false warnings are frowned upon, and I'd also add that you are a fine one to speak of \""stalking\"" when you seem to appear on pages shortly after Tony does in an apparent effort to \""tag-team\"" him (such as your recent post here). One of the reasons why it is important to research events rather than just leap in with fake, unsubstantiated \""warnings\"" is that it helps to avoid posts that make you look foolish. Even the most cursory of examination of my contributions list - freely and easily accessible through my signature in addition to the usual methods - would demonstrate thousands upon thousands of edits to television-related articles, especially to the main articles for individual series. It is hardly \""stalking\"" when Tony1's actions tonight caused my watchlist to light up like a Christmas tree. --'''
[Ckatz]: Yes, thank you for locating that information. It was temporarily removed for verification, rewritten and reformatted, then replaced in the article just prior to your posting this. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks to both of you for this. Akraj's abuse of Wikipedia for personal benefit goes back several years. While he is primarily targeting me at this time, he and his socks have also attacked other Wikipedians who objected to his self-promotional edits (for example, at [[Talk:Sustainability]]) and his efforts at vanity spam were also rejected by the India Wikiproject. --'''
[Ckatz]: I certainly appreciate the note; thank you and likewise for vocalizing my frustrations. While I obviously disagree with the changes you made, consensus could certainly go either way. However, my bigger concern is that we (the collective \""we\"" in general, not just you and I and this one case) exercise more discretion in changing guidelines and policies than we might use in article space. (A emphasis on discussion ''before'' changes would help in this respect; that way, you and I could have agreed or disagreed on the talk page, others could hae chimed in, and then the final language could go in with a minimum of back-and-forth editing.) --'''
[Ckatz]: Your note summarizes the problem. It is your opinion that your method is better; at least two other editors disagree. Per the long-established [[WP:BRD|\""bold-revert-discuss\""]] concept, the onus is now on you to make the case for it on the talk page, '''not'' to simply keep restoring your preferred version. Note that you have now reverted your version back in [[WP:3RR|three times in less than 24 hours]]. --'''
[Ckatz]: It's actually not too bad. I've tweaked it a bit and moved some text further down; hopefully that will address your concerns. As for the \""New Coke\"" link, the two are really apples and oranges, I'm afraid. Changes to hosts, rapid cancellations, and the like are not uncommon in television, whereas the New Coke debacle was something unique in terms of corporate icons and product marketing. --'''
[Ckatz]: I've explained this on your talk page, but in short it has nothing to do with the accuracy of your comments. Instead, it is the fact that ''you'' (not you personally, but you as a Wikipedia editor and series viewer) are the one making the observations. Generally speaking, we do not note continuity, production, or other such errors with regard to television series and other works of fiction. Thee only exception is if said errors become notable in the real world through the observations of [[WP:RS}reliable sources]] such as an expert in the respective field. --'''
[Ckatz]: Please read through the talk page archives for [[Earth]], where you will find extensive discussions regarding this matter. The established consensus is to use the scientific perspective in this article. You certainly won't lose editing privileges for adding the material the first time; it is the repeated attempts to do so in the face of requests, explanations, and warnings that can lead to such actions. Please feel free to ask if you have any additional questions. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... FYI, I have restored the request for a check on the IP. Let me be perfectly clear - I mean no disrespect at all to your position as a clerk at the CU page. Ordinarily, I would support your assertion that this might be perceived as \""fishing\"", and as such would not even have made the request to begin with. However, as the admin who has had to oversee a large portion of the EHC matter, I can speak with authority in stating that this individual - who has been ''banned'' from the community - has a clearly defined pattern of block evasion, facilitated by use of multiple IP and registered sock accounts. As such, I have restored the posting with the request that this application be judged by a checkuser, given that it involves a long, long history of abusive behaviour. A simple review of this individual's contribution history, his sock account lists, and related incidents will demonstrate how these socks have been used in attempts to control article content, disrupt formal Wikipedia procedures (such as RfAs, ANI proceedings, and the like), and actively target Wikipedia users through extremely abusive behaviour on- and off-site. While the IP block at 65.31.103.28 may prevent him from using accounts from that location, he has a history of linking in form other ports with these sock accounts. --'''

[Ckatz]: Thank you for the note. I've added the page to my watchlist and will keep an eye on the situation. If the problem becomes more pronounced - say, for example, the IP starts reverting rapidly - please leave me a note, or contact any administrator for more immediate action. Thanks again. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... sorry to disturb, but in [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Mars&diff=prev&oldid=360305712 this edit] you removed a reference link from the article [[Mars]]. Is there a problem with that reference, or some other concern? (I've restored it for now, as there was no edit summary to explain the removal, but if you feel it should go please let me know and I'll revert myself.) Thanks in advance. --'''
[Ckatz]: Ah, found it - it references the \""red soil\"" text but was inadvertently removed a few days ago. I've restored it. Thanks again. --'''
[Ckatz]: (replied on user's talk page re\"" COI) --'''
[Ckatz]: Sorry, but the second comment in particular was not helpful at all. It is rather frustrating to see proponents of mass delinking continually reject, ignore, or treat with contempt any objections that are raised against their actions, then raise spurious complaints about those who raise the objections. (As for your comment about your edits being reverted, no offence, but there is no obligation to inform you about minor formatting issues. The articles appeared on my watchlist, I reviewed the changes, felt they were not beneficial, and thus reverted them. Nothing more, nothing less.) --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... you should post your thoughts on the article talk page to see if other editors feel it is suitable for inclusion. After reviewing the text, and the related article, there does not appear to be wide acceptance for the theory. Do you have information that suggests otherwise? --'''
[Ckatz]: Please note that pages are not - and ''cannot'' - be \""taken over\"" by any one editor. Content is open for editing by all, and there is no \""preferred version\"" that a company can approve or revert to. It is not strictly the \""employee\"" status as much as it is the connection to the company, either directly or indirectly. If GeoVector finds someone, in all likelihood that person will have the same COI problems that an employee would. What I was meaing was that the article needs someone ''independent of GeoVector, its employees and their associates'' who can fairly assess the matter. Please remember that the article is not GeoVector's page on Wikipedia, it is Wikipedia's page about GeoVector. There is a clear and distinct difference between the two concepts. --'''
[Ckatz]: As far as I can tell, the spelling I restored is consistent with the existing standard (British English), as it restored \""-our\"" (\""vapour\"") instead of the American \""vapor\"". --'''
[Ckatz]: Hey, thanks for the heads-up. It is yet another incident involving [[User:Akraj|Akraj]], an indef-blocked individual who feels he can use Wikipedia to promote his own theories and opinions. --'''
[Ckatz]: '''May 2010''' Hello, Mark... sorry to trouble you with this, but sometime in the past eight hours a glitch developed with respect to your very useful script. I'm using it on the Monobook skin, and what happens is that it now removes ''all'' entries from my \""Special:Contributions\"" list, not just those pages where I am the most recent contributor. (As there are no changes listed in the code for over two weeks, I'm presuming that it is a Mediawiki issue that's affecting the script.) Any thoughts on this? --'''
[Ckatz]: FYI, I've also opened a discussion [[Wikipedia:Village_pump_(technical)#Script_issue_-_User:Markhurd.2Fhidetopcontrib.js|here]] regarding the issue; one thought posted there is that it might be related to the activation of \""single-revision deletion\"" in that time period. --'''
[Ckatz]: No problem, and thanks for the note. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: There's an essay that speaks to this - [[WP:DUCK]]. In this case, the accounts have similar names, edit the same articles, and (most importantly) are adding the same information regarding apparent fan fiction. --'''
[Ckatz]: (replied on user's talk page) --'''
[Ckatz]: Hey, sorry this guy (indef-blocked vanity spammer [[User:Akraj]]) is now pestering you on your talk page. It is par for the course with him, unfortunately; whenever I revert his latest vanity spam additions, he targets someone I've recently interacted with in this fashion. If you want more info on the whole mess I can certainly give you a list of links to older discussions. Cheers. --'''

[Ckatz]: Again, sorry for the inconvenience. I'm not comfortable with adding protection to your talk page, especially without checking with you first, but you may wish to consider adding it yourself. Thoughts? --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... thanks for the reply. FYI, the banned user [[User:Akraj|Akraj]] is not ''likely'' to be one and the same with Anil Rajvanshi, he ''is'' Rajvanshi ''by his own admission'' several years ago. That user has been using Wikipedia to add links to his own material - opinion pieces, his web site, and so on - for several years now. He has used numerous rotating IP accounts and single-purpose accounts (as verified through Checkuser requests) to evade his block. he has also adopted a pattern of targeting editors who challenge his efforts, often with an abusive pattern of behaviour. (He has insulted editors, repeatedly reverted them, made accusations of bias and immaturity, and a sock of his was even CU'ed to confirm that he was attempting to disrupt my RfA.) Many of the \""citations\"" he adds are links to self-written opinion pieces and essays, as opposed to third-party reviews of his work. He also likes to use the socks to add fluffy text (''\""an interesting idea\""'' etc.) featuring his own ideas. Over the past year or so, he's been harassing me in particular because I've kept his typical articles watchlisted.  --'''
[Ckatz]: With respect to the citation in question, I researched the article history. As it turns out, you were in fact the one to add it here. However, I note that you have also edited the article [[dew]]. That article was repeatedly edited by known socks of Rajvanshi, in order to add the identical link to his own proposal. These IPs and socks were also responsible for repeatedly adding non-encyclopedic text promoting the proposal (such as ''\""An interesting concept of large scale dew condensation near the sea shore was made by scientists in University of Florida in 1980s\""''). Is it possible that you brought the text and the citation from ''that'' article when you added it to \""air well\""? The article history shows that on the day you added text about the sea water idea, the self-promotional citation was in fact present in \""dew\"" having been added by a [[Special:Contributions\/218.248.79.4|known IP sock of Akraj]] a few weeks previously in [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Dew&diff=286401126&oldid=286361578 this edit]. Note also that the abstract in question (I've seen it used by Rajvanshi himself before) outlines a ''proposed'' concept, not an actual method, and even states that the idea is not cost-effective. Even if we factor out the Rajvanshi-Wikipedia spam problem, the concept itself may not even be notable enough to warrant inclusion. --'''
[Ckatz]: It may well be correct. however, you need to source it to a [[WP:RS|reliable source]], not just a site whose author expresses opposition to ethanol. --'''
[Ckatz]: Not sure how, exactly, I'm supposed to have secured a Comcast IP up in Canada, let alone used the IP to edit dozens of articles I've never visited before. --'''
[Ckatz]: Interesting that the indef-blocked spammer Akraj is choosing another banned user as his model. Even more interesting, Mr. Rajvanshi, is that you've selectively chosen to present HarryAlffa's ''draft'' ArbComm note, but completely ignored the fact that his claims were utterly rejected. You have also forgotten to mention [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Special:Log&type=block&page=User%3AHarryAlffa HA's block history], with blocks for ''\""disruptive editing\""'', ''\""persistent battlegrounding\""'', ''\""persistent reverting against consensus\""'', ''\""using ArbCom elections as personal agenda platform\""'', and finally the indef ban for a ''\""systematic pattern of disruption, personal attacks, incivility, not here to build an encyclopedia\""''. On a related note, would you care to discuss [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=block&user=&page=User%3AAkraj&year=&month=-1&tagfilter= your own block history], which involves ''\""spamming  links to external sites\""'', ''\""sockpuppetry\""'', and finally ''\""abusing multiple accounts: harrassment under other accounts\""''? --'''
[Ckatz]: I've also emailed you with respect to this, but as far as I know, the only posts I've ever removed are the repeated attack posts directed against me by abusive sockpuppets of an indef-blocked user per Wikipedia's policies regarding the prohibition of block evasion. If any of your posts were removed, it most certainly was an unfortunate error. --'''
[Ckatz]: Whoops, you don't have email. --'''
[Ckatz]: As pointed out to you by [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Vertigo_Acid&diff=prev&oldid=364880227 Vertigo Acid], it is a very relevant link. Using loaded terms such as \""swamped\"" and \""plastered\"" - which are completely out of context to this case - serves only to sidetrack the conversation. You'd find I'd be a lot more supportive of your delinking campaign if you focused on the real problems (such as excessive multiple links, terms that truly don't need links, etc.) instead of obsessing over useful, relevant links. By the way, I'll state yet again that I really do not appreciate misleading posts such as [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Vertigo_Acid&diff=364876750&oldid=344304323 your initial comment] on Vertigo Acid's talk page. That does not help the collaborative process. --'''
[Ckatz]: Simply put, repeatedly removing valid issue templates is not kosher. The article is interesting, but not encyclopedic in tone, and that is not a reflection on the subject but instead on the way it is currently written. We are not here to present flowery prose about a subject, we are here to deliver clear, accurate, properly sourced information in an encyclopedic manner. With respect to verifiability, simply saying \""everything is true and verifiable\"" along with a long list of books and sites doesn't help a non-resident to verify the claims; saying the subject is \""different\"" doesn't mean that we can dro the encyclopedic style. (I'd also appreciate it if you'd skip the silly ''\""vested interest\""'' claim; it makes no sense, given my geographic location, and serves only to distract from the real issue. Thanks. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thank you for your note. I see now where your confusion lies; you appear to be misinterpreting the expressed concerns as an argument for ''not including'' the article. That is not the case; what needs to be done is that the ''writing'' and ''references'' need to be brought in line with Wikipedia's standards. Copyediting serves to rework the writing style, layout, etc. to make the article match other entries; peacock terms are overly promotional words and phrases that - while appropriate for promotional literature - do not belong in an encyclopedia article. Finally, with regard to references, you have provided a list of books and links. However, not all of those entires meet the standards of our [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] guideline, and they also need to be matched to the important facts and details in the article. Given that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia that anyone can edit, we place a high importance on making sure that any reader can also ''verify'' the facts that are presented. I hope this eases your concerns. --'''
[Ckatz]: While I remain skeptical as to your true intentions, I would be interested in seeing honest answers to these questions. --'''
[Ckatz]: TisTRU, '''no-one is suggesting the article should be deleted'''. It requires cleanup, and the tags are there to draw the attention of skilled copy editors. As for the references, it is simply a case of taking the sources, identifying which ones meet the [[WP:RS|reliables ources]] guideline, and then matching those up to details in the text. Again, '''no deletion is proposed'''. --'''
[Ckatz]: I think you're misunderstanding the purpose of the \""main article\"" tag; it points readers to an article that expands on the content presented in the section. --'''
[Ckatz]: Once again, it's not the story, it is the writing. It needs to be rewritten in an encyclopedic style. --'''
[Ckatz]: Not sure how many times this has to be repeated... the wording of the articles needs to be re-written in order to match Wikipedia's house style. Again, you really, really need to read through the [[WP:MOS|Manual of Style]] to familiarize yourself with what is expected for articles. As for your claims above, I've never said it was fabricated, never called for deletion, never said the subject was unsuitable - those are all your personal, repeated ''misinterpretations'' despite numerous attempts to convince you otherwise. If you think the revised wording needs tweaking, then tweak it - it was put in as a demonstration for you to see what is needed. --'''
[Ckatz]: Tony, you say you wish to have productive engagement. Here's a good starting point: please stop misrepresenting the people who disagree with you. For example, you have repeatedly announced to the community that I want to link everything. I cannot comprehend why you insist on doing that, especially since I've told you that is incorrect many, many times, I've asked you over and over not to keep making such misleading statements, and - perhaps most telling - ''I do not actually do anything of the sort''. I'm sure you would find it very frustrating if I had been repeatedly telling other editors that you hate links and won't rest until articles are completely in plain text. How are we supposed to move forward in such an environment? --'''
[Ckatz]: Not improper in the least, thank you very much for pointing that out. The block should probably be adjusted accordingly. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: You have to consider whether or not the incident is relevant to a global audience, and whether or not it is [[WP:UNDUE|undue weight]] on a relatively minor incident. --'''
[Ckatz]: It would be helpful if you could assume good faith, rather than making spurious (and grossly incorrect) claims. Please actually look at the edit history, where you will note that my contributions primarily involve removing spam links placed by individuals trying to use the article as an advertising opportunity. --'''
[Ckatz]: It should be self-evident, but I've already left an explanation on your talk page. There are at least five elements of your post that are clearly not \""good faith\"" assertions. You may have meant well, but your post did not convey that in any way. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the note. If you can find a different (and [[WP:RS|reliable]]) source to verify the text, please feel free to restore it. The IAE site, however, has been added to the spam blacklist. Thanks again. --'''
[Ckatz]: Having investigated this further, all of [[Special:Contributions\/Susieq3140]]'s edits appear to be for the sole purpose of promoting these \""awards\"" form the US Sports Academy, using a \""third party\"" reference to a domain owned by the same place. --'''
[Ckatz]: I also tracked down an AfD from a few years back ([[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\/United States Sports Academy]]) that led to the deletion of a number of articles about the awards themselves; the conclusion was that the awards were not notable. (The nom asserted that ''\""there was no evidence that the 'recipients' were aware of or accepted the 'honorary degrees'\""''.) --'''
[Ckatz]: Actually, per [[WP:LINKROT]], we tag the link as dead. I've now done so; sorry for forgetting to place that template at first. --'''
[Ckatz]: TV series continue to exist as creative works, even after production of new episodes ceases. In a similar manner, we would not refer to a book or a film using \""was\"". --'''
[Ckatz]: You cannot post links to your own opinion pages. That is a clear violation of Wikipedia's guidelines and policies. --'''
[Ckatz]: (thanks - replied on your talk page) --'''
[Ckatz]: One wonders why they never stop even when warned. He's now got 31 hours to think about how to contribute productively. Thanks for tagging in. --'''
[Ckatz]: No problem, happy to help. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: The \""Overmind\"" site appears to feature a large collection of blogs that anyone can sign up to contribute, so I'm not convinced we can use it as a reference source (unlike some other Zap2it sub-sites). In the particular case of Brittany Frederick, she does not seem to be an authority on reviewing the technical qualities of Blu-Ray discs, but instead a fan who is ecstatic that her favourite show is now on Blu-Ray. --'''
[Ckatz]: I guess it would depend on the quality of the interviews. Her blog on the Blu-Ray seemed to \""gush\"", so I'd be cautious in what she writes about the people as she may have just asked a lot of soft questions. --'''
[Ckatz]: Good point about the DVD sections, by the way. I think if we develop them further to include interesting points perhaps about how the presentation differs from the original broadcast - for example, if it is the only place to find hi-def or if the director uses the release as a chance to do the version he or she actually wanted to do originally - than we can make them more valuable to the reader. --'''
[Ckatz]: Those two pages are semi-protected because of significant back-and-forth edits from IPs; it should not affect you (nor was it directed at you) as you are a registered editor. --'''
[Ckatz]: Good point - hadn't thought of that. Thanks for mentioning it. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Sorry, I have to disagree with certain aspects of what you have said. While I can appreciate the issues you've identified, this is not a trivia section, but a section about the characters presented in a series. Most well-developed articles about series will incorporate such a section, which is why I felt that the wholesale deletion of the material was not appropriate. As you may have noted by now, I have started trimming and cleaning up the individual entries to remove commentary and focus on facts. I will need assistance from editors who are more familiar with the show in verifying some details from show content. --'''
[Ckatz]: Actually, you were the one removing them; it would have been best to stop when you were initially reverted, instead of removing the names repeatedly. --'''
[Ckatz]: Please do not mislabel this as \""vandalism\"". Note the link to AN\/I [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard\/Incidents&diff=prev&oldid=404481613 here], and the comment that the IP was a sock of a blocked\/banned user. --'''
[Ckatz]: No mistaken identity, Shootbamboo, although I see the mixup with the vandalism label. Note that the IP is a sock of a banned user, and as such not permitted to post or edit. Hence the removal. --'''
[Ckatz]: Excuse me? The change I fixed was to link the terms separately, in order to avoid using [[Vancouver, British Columbia]] (which is a redirect to [[Vancouver]]). Note that you then self-reverted without noting your error. --'''
[Ckatz]: OC, your hide was unwarranted and also rather selective. So, too, was your post at AN\/I, especially since you chose to ignore the incivility and sidetracking perpetrated by some of your compatriots on the linking page. However, I do welcome any outside attention that the AN\/I post might bring to the real problems on that page. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the notification; I have responded there. --'''
[Ckatz]: FYI, rumours regarding David Tennant's personal life have been a problem with respect to that article for years now. While many IPs and new editors have added text about it, there has not yet been a reliable enough source to support keeping the material. Before removing the ''Mail'' link (it was added elsewhere earlier today), I did review it and also searched Wikipedia for past discussions regarding the ''Daily Mail'' as a [[WP:RS|reliable source]]. An extensive discussion appears to have developed the conclusion that it is best to ensure that the ''Mail'' is not the ''only'' source we're using; that is to say, if another reliable source (not the ''Sun'' or other tabs) publishes the same information, we can proceed. Keep in mind that, given Tennant's popularity, there should be wide-spread coverage in Britain if it is in fact real. We lose nothing by waiting a few days to see what turns up. --'''
[Ckatz]: The page was set up with indef. pending and ''short-term'' semi due to a rash of unsourced\/poorly sourced changes. However, given the discussion at [[Talk:David Tennant]], it is worth ending SP early to see what transpires. Thanks for bringing it up. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... thanks for posting. I've since restored a mention of the organization, minus the overly PR-sounding parts. If you can find third-party analysis or commentary on their work, it may warrant expansion. Please feel free to let me know if you need assistance or have any other questions. Thanks again, and welcome to Wikipedia! --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... thanks for the follow-up. Actually, we did end up restoring the text once the ''Times'' report appeared, along with the qualifier that neither Tennant or Moffett had confirmed it. There's still uncertainty as to the accuracy, given that all the reliable ones - Times, Wired, etc - seem to be basing their reports on the original ''Sun'' and ''Mail'' reports. You can see the discussion at [[Talk:David Tennant]]. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: No, shouldn't end that way. I'll post to the talk page and we can see what the result is. Fair enough? --'''
[Ckatz]: No objections, I should have been clearer in saying that a redirect would preserve the work done so far - formatting, userbox, etc. - that a deletion would eliminate. Thanks for doing the redirect. --'''
[Ckatz]: While you have cited certain aspects of the BLP policy, please note that you err in saying that it is ''your'' page. Wikipedia pages are not the same as personal pages on a subject's own web site, and the subject cannot dictate what information is and is not displayed. (Otherwise - ''and please let it be perfectly clear that I am not in any way suggesting ''you'' are trying to do this'' -  a subject could for example simply reject any content that they feel portrays them in a negative manner.) Also, this request is somewhat complicated by the fact that you have presented some of this information, such as your place of birth, in your own books. Finally, while they may possibly be room to accommodate your request, any such request would need to go through the Foundation so as to privately verify that you are actually who you say you are. (Nothing personal, but it is an anonymous system here - anyone could claim to be anyone in the absence of proof to the contrary.) --'''
[Ckatz]: However, as per past discussions, the encyclopaedia uses the international IHO terminology, as evidenced by the respective articles. It would be confusing to have the newly added navbox using a different term from the articles. I have reworked your note to reflect what the related Australian articles use. Would it help with your concerns if we put \""<small>(Southern Ocean)<\/small>\"" under the Indian Ocean entry? --'''
[Ckatz]: Actually, I went ahead and tested such an entry. I then reverted it out, but you can see it [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Victoria_(Australia)&oldid=409421705#See_also here]. --'''
[Ckatz]: One, you need to let others make that call; as a new editor (and one whose only contributions involve trying to add the material) you'll need to work to avoid being considered a [[WP:SPA|single-purpose editor]]. --'''
[Ckatz]: It appears to closely resemble [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\/DVDVideoSoft]]. --'''
[Ckatz]: Semi-protected for two weeks, can be extended if the problem returns. Thanks, and sleep well... --'''
[Ckatz]: Noted, and I've updated the rationale. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Sure, why not? Maybe it will get some more regulars involved... --'''
[Ckatz]: The problem lies in some of the language used, as it was non-encyclopedic and (in some cased) rather loaded. (For example, the description of Aitken as a \""political prisoner\"".) As well, several of the references used were unacceptable as they were from blogs and\/or opinion pieces. I have now reworked the material to bring it into line. --'''
[Ckatz]: Please see the [[WP:EL|external links guideline]]. Wikipedia is not a directory service. Thanks. --'''
[Ckatz]: The promotional aspect appears because you appear to be connected to the articles, given that your account name is the same as the reference name you chose. If this was simply a case of using your own name to name the reference, then please disregard. However, the site you linked to - \""Clickheredummy\"" - does not constitute a [[WP:RS|reliable source]] and cannot serve as a reference. We have no way of knowing if the article is in fact from ''Popular Mechanics'', as they claim, nor do we know if they even have permission to republish said article. If you can find a source that meets the reliable source protocol. by all means add it (and please feel free to ask if you have questions about any potential sources you may find). --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... sorry to have to ask this, given all your work here, but you need to stop reverting the word \""season\"" in place of \""series\"" for the list of Doctor Who episodes. Despite the airing on BBCA, the article is written in British English and as such uses the appropriate spellings. (We do not mix spellings, as demonstrated in [[Cheque]].) Incidentally, I dialled up your contributions to see if you had posted about the \""series\""\/\""season\"" matter and noticed that you were also reverting in \""Quebecois\"" at the \""Iron Chef\"" list. Again, please note that we would in fact use \""Canada\"" in that case; the notes refer to the country and the subject's own article uses \""Canadian\"". Thanks in advance. --'''
[Ckatz]: We would need a definitive source (i.e. ABC or the production company) to illustrate that the period is in fact considered a part of the title (as opposed to a stylistic matter). ABC's official schedule does not incorporate the period as part of the title. I have reworked the lead accordingly. --'''
[Ckatz]: The site does not appear to meet the requirements for an article, and there have been more than half a dozen accounts created solely to promote this site. Unfortunately, yours appears to be yet another one. --'''
[Ckatz]: Ah, that edit... that was when I transcluded part of the guideline so that we could lock it (and leave the rest open). Unfortunately, what was revealed afterward was that it can make the diffs rather hard to read, because you seem to end up with a mix of the diff from ''that date'' for the material in the page you're reading and the diff for ''today's'' date from the page that is trancluded (or something like that - basically, it's a mess, and I avoid doing it unless absolutely necessary). Edits seem to disappear from the history, even though they are clear in the actual page content. (Unfortunately, I can't help with your question about any discussions; I don't recall anything about NBSPs, but then again I wasn't pondering them at the time and as such wouldn't have been looking for any such discussions. Sorry...) --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the heads-up; I've added the page to my watchlist and will monitor developments. --'''
[Ckatz]: See the list of episodes, which describes how the nine episodes intended as a seventh season were merged into the sixth season. You are double-counting those nine episodes. --'''
[Ckatz]: Done, thanks for the note. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the quick response. FYI, the regs for sourcing material for [[WP:BLP|biographies]] tend to be much stricter than for other articles, and thus there is more likelihood that material will be pulled until a citation can be found (as opposed to tagging). With respect to your edit, I'd suggest that you apply at the spam whitelist to see if you can get that particular page whitelisted for that article. As an aside, it would seem that the second set of text - \""at an early age...\"" - is not needed and a bit PR-ish. (For encyclopaedic purposes, the reader can come to that conclusion by the fact that she started so early.) Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks, I've fixed the ''Oprah'' article. The category is only applied once the final episode has aired. --'''
[Ckatz]: Note that, while pages may sometimes ''initially'' be posted by an agent or other such representative, once posted they are subject to the standards expected of all articles. There is no \""ownership\"" permitted, and articles cannot be rewritten to suit the desires of the subject or their PR representatives. --'''
[Ckatz]: I'm presuming that you are one-and-the same as [[User:Sheldonsheldrake]]. If so, you would be better served in sticking to just one account. Also note that we are not \""pushing the negative\""; if you check the reviews I went to the trouble of adding as references, you'll see that it includes a positive review. Also note that we're not highlighting direct quotes from the reviews any more, but instead simply stating a basic fact about the reception. I'm sure that, if the RT rating was exceptionally high, you'd expect that detail to be mentioned. Also, please note that it is very likely that many of the articles about \""newer\"" directors and producers are largely contributed by their representatives. However, the probability that those articles - which would tend to be rather low-traffic - have not been properly reviewed by uninvolved editors does not warrant taking similar actions in one that has. --'''
[Ckatz]: Well, the first link is to the RT page, which includes all of the reviews. By the way, the fact that his film had such an exceptionally low critical reception is certainly a relevant fact about Mr. Glatzer's life, one that is certainly more notable than the release date for the DVD. --'''
[Ckatz]: I've restored the changes, with the rationale noted in he edit summary. It may not have been clear, but my edits did not remove all of your changes. Some were kept, some were reverted, and others were trimmed for brevity. No-one will doubt your efforts. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the note. I will look into the matter and let you know where to apply for the change. Please feel free to leave me a reminder if you have not had a reply in a week or so, in case I am busy. Cheers. Your translation was not a problem, by the way; I hope mine is also acceptable:<blockquote>''\""Merci pour cette note. Je vais \xe9tudier la question et vous laisser savoir \xe0 qui s'adresser pour le changement. S'il vous pla\xeet n'h\xe9sitez pas \xe0 me laisser un rappel si vous n'avez pas eu une r\xe9ponse dans une semaine ou deux, au cas o\xf9 je suis occup\xe9. Cheers. Votre traduction n'\xe9tait pas un probl\xe8me, soit dit en passant, j'esp\xe8re que le mien est acceptable.\""''<\/blockquote> --'''
[Ckatz]: No problem, I appreciate you taking the time to reply. Wikipedia articles treat a series as a complete body of work, instead of a collection of individual events. Essentially, we document the entire run instead of being \""in the moment\"". (Fictional works exist in what has been described as a \""perpetual present\"" in that the current reality is entirely dependent upon which episode you are watching.) An actor who serves in a main role is thus always represented as such, and is not relegated to \""former\"" status. Hope this helps. --'''
[Ckatz]: The information about the award was in fact retained; however, it was reduced to the essential details that relate to the tower, and moved up a bit. The other material was more related to your company and was not needed. Please keep in mind that, as an employee of the company, you do have a [[WP:COI|conflict of interest]] with respect to adding said material. It is better to ask on the talk page as to the encyclopaedic nature of the material rather than simply adding it. (This is not to discourage you from contributing; however, it would be more appropriate to add material that you can draw upon from a more general experience with engineering rather than text specific to your company and its projects.) --'''
[Ckatz]: I would say that it is really a mistake to resort to heavy-handed threats like that; not only are you somewhat misrepresenting the situation, but it unnecessarily adds tension to the discussion. Please note that ''you'' are the one who removed the long-standing text that is in fact supported by the reference, because you erroneously thought the link was dead, and ''you'' are the one who repeatedly deleted text three times after that. While I may have restored ''my'' attempt at compromise a second time, my subsequent edit involved rolling back to the existing consensus version (consensus in this case meaning the one that had been accepted for quite some time) so that we could discuss the matter on an even footing. (Your rationale for removal was predicated on the assumption that the link in question was dead; it was not, but even if it was it could easily have been tagged as dead given that the source - the BBC - is certainly reliable. Also note - and I say this while recognizing the ''spirit'' of 3RR - that I did not actually revert 4 times in 24 hours.) Honestly, the best and most proper approach on both our parts should have been to properly respect [[WP:BRD]]: you removed some text, I restore it, then we discuss. Unfortunately, neither of us took that route; while we are discussing it now (and hopefully getting additional voices as well) please leave aside the needlessly provocative threats. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for passing that along. However, after looking at Mr. Kohs' work on that site, I have significant concerns about whether he is actually intending to write a balanced piece. His writing seems heavily skewed to a particular POV with regard to Wikipedia, one that I can't help but wonder may be influenced by the fact he is trying to promote his own for-profit wiki. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hmm... having reviewed more of his work, I don't trust him at all. Highly sensationalized, lacking in any apparent journalistic standards, apparently just trying to stir up the muck.  No thanks. --'''
[Ckatz]: --'''
[Ckatz]: Skomorokh, I'm sure you are operating in good faith, and I do regret it if you object to my removal of Peter Damian's comment from your page. However, Damian - the user operating as the ever-changing IP 109.x - has been banned from the community, and that includes any contributions made as an IP sockpuppet. If you disagree with this, you need to take it up at the appropriate forum. However, we cannot simply revert a banned user's material back in. --'''
[Ckatz]: You can take responsibility for the content, but the link has to stay out. Furthermore, please note that the policy clearly outlines that \""bans apply to all editing, good or bad\"". Also, with respect to \""edits by and on behalf of banned editors\"", note the text that states: ''\""Wikipedians in turn are not permitted to post or edit material at the direction of a banned editor (sometimes called proxy editing or proxying) unless they are able to confirm that the changes are verifiable and they have independent reasons for making them\""''. You may have your own opinions about Mr. Damian - I can't speak to that - but it does not override the fact that his behaviour has led to a ban from Wikipedia. Quoting from [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard\/Incidents&oldid=305734197#Peter_Damian the discussion regarding that ban]:<blockquote>''\""He's banned, full stop - his accounts are blocked. Any socks are blocked. Any IP addresses or additional accounts linked to him after the ban passes are blocked.\""''<\/blockquote> --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... with respect to the Kohs matter, I just wanted to be clear that I realize you are merely the messenger. I appreciate that you took the time to pass on the request. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... with respect to the Kohs matter, I just wanted to be clear that I realize you are merely the messenger. I appreciate that you took the time to pass on the request. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Re: the above, Damian has repeatedly used IP socks (as well as sock accounts, apparently) to edit the \""Sum of Logic\"" page. He has also indicated, through his actions and his posts, that he has no intention of stopping this behaviour or to stop trying to get links to his site. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the feedback; I'm glad that the tweaked version works for you. I'd be happy to take a look at the intro you mentioned over the next few days; please feel free to remind me if I forget. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: I will investigate through the television project, but the convention is (as far as I am aware) to avoid years. Furthermore, we would not use \""Season One\"" but instead \""Season one\"". --'''
[Ckatz]: Your \""praise\"" was sarcastic in nature, or at least that is how it read. If you meant differently, I'm prepared to assume good faith. However, the escalation of this minor, minor matter to arbcom is - IMHO - way over the top, and I have responded there accordingly. --'''
[Ckatz]: Your domain, as I'm not a viewer. However, note that you'll have to source the articles and establish notability for them from independent sources. Also, note that you should only add article titles to the template once an article exists. We avoid red links in templates. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Ah, didn't see the duplicate entry. Thanks for catching that. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks... check out the rewrite, and let me know if it works for you. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Elen, could you please point me to the discussion regarding the so-called \""courtesy blanking\"" of pages relating to Peter Damian? I find it rather surprising that we are wiping out pertinent notices with regard to a banned, known problem user. Thank you in advance. --'''
[Ckatz]: While I can't speak to what ArbCom agreed to, I don't agree with your statement about not tagging at least the registered socks. However, we'll see if PD can stay away. FYI, though, you might need to add a different rationale to the speedy for the IP pages as U2 doesn't appear to cover IPs who have edited. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Simply put, it is not suitable content. The page is intended as an overview of the concept, not as a site to highlight specific businesses. (Wikipedia is not a promotional tool.) However, you are encouraged to contribute in areas where you do not have a direct conflict of interest. Please feel free to ask if you would like assistance in doing so. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Feel free to revert, if you must. A few thoughts, though. One, it is most certainly not uncommon to blank or otherwise remove that sort of information from blocked or banned users. Two, the edit in question can ''in no possible way'' be defined as an \""edit war\"". Alison changed the material, someone else reverted her good-faith change, it drew my attention (having had to block one of the user's socks) and I removed his contact information. I think a more appropriate question would be why it is necessary to ''keep'' a series of links for a banned user. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... saw your post. Frankly, there was nothing incorrect in blanking the information. ArbCom blocked\/banned the individual; unless there is information to the contrary, they did not state that we could not delete the contact information. Furthermore, there is nothing unusual about blanking pages of banned users, and we don't typically maintain off-site contact information for someone who has violated Wikipedia's rules to such a degree that they manage to get banned. Lastly, there most certainly was nothing that could be described as an edit war. You can of course decide as you see fit, but it would be more appropriate to leave the information off of the page. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Note that an indef user who no admin will unblock is effectively banned, especially when one factors in that Kohs was unblocked and then reblocked several times. There is also nothing out of the ordinary in blanking off-site links from the pages of such a user. After all, the external links and sites were a definite factor in the original blocks. --'''
[Ckatz]: FYI, I've tweaked your edit to standardize on British English (\""colour\"") instead of the US \""color\"". Thanks for catching the inconsistency; however, looking back through the article history, it appears to use British English from at least five years ago. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: FYI, I've reverted your changes with respect to this. There doesn't appear to be any discussion leading to the changes, and a similar attempt last year was not accepted either. If consensus for the change does develop, then so be it, but that needs to happen first given the number of articles it would affect. Please let me know if there are any articles with unrelated grammatical changes that may have been inadvertently reversed in the process, as I can assist in restoring them. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks, I'll check it now. --'''

I am under no editing sanction. You should not have done it and you should apologise. [[User:Fys|Fys]]. &#147;

There is absolutely no rule that prohibits an editor from editing something on which they are known or suspected of having an opinion; it would rule you out from all British politics articles for a start. So I repudiate the suggestion that I have any conflict of interest at all.

Lar,True,"[Lar]: Hi, I see you added Railbox and TTX to [[:Category:Cooperatives]]...  would you think that all the terminal roads (railways in and around a city owned by the major connecting railways in that city, for example [[Indiana Harbor Belt]] and union station companies (companies set up to operate large stations such as Chicago Union Station, etc) are also cooperatives? I'm wondering if adding these to that category actually adds information  or not. Also, would you say that the [[Conrail]] Shared Assets Area is a cooperative? it is owned by the two railroads that use it (it's what remains after Conrail was demerged)... I would say it is not. Just curious as to your thoughts. ++
[Lar]: Hi! I couldn't help but notice that the ABC article I started and self nom-ed didn't last long in DYK. I was quite honored that it was chosen but rather disappointed that it didn't last very long at all... Was there something about it that made it unsuitable? I saw that the target text I put in the suggestion got rather mangled to the point that it didn't quite say what it should have. It was my first nomination so while trying to avoid [[WP:OWN]] about the whole thing, I'm still rather curious. Thanks! (I've set a watch here so feel free to respond here, I'll see it) ++
[Lar]: No worries. Thanks for the explanation. Seems rather a thankless job, so thanks for doing it! And it was up long enough to get a bunch of good edits from a variety of other folks, so that's a plus too! (I am watching here, you don't need to copy over to my talk page, but thanks for that anyway.)... ++
[Lar]: Thanks! I appreciate the clarification\/support. ++
[Lar]: \""ANNOYED\"" eh? haha. userify the above article text to my userspace for me (I'm not an admin), and I'll create the Cliff L. Biffle article and merge it in... and then propose merges for the other two esoterics that you kept. How would that be? <font color=\""green\"">[[User:Lar\/Esperanza|+]]<\/font>+
[Lar]: (I watch what I start and prefer to keep all threads in one place, feel free to reply here, in fact please do...) K, thanks. I think I'll preserve the history via a series of moves, first to [[User:Lar\/Cliff L. Biffle]] then to [[Cliff L. Biffle]] once it's ready. See any problem with that? I tend to do that with articles I author and then tag the remnant redirect (which has nothing in it, since the history went with the moved article) for speedy... <font color=\""green\"">[[User:Lar\/Esperanza|+]]<\/font>+

[Lar]: I see that your RfA request has been closed early by a 'crat. Don't take it too hard, please. Essjay did what was best for you and the project at this stage in your activities, (your wikicareer if you like) here. People look for certain qualities when they choose admins, among them experience, measured in time and number of good edits across many different areas, and understanding of how things are done. Keep contributing, learn the ways here, and if you're still interested in a few months, and interested for the right reasons (some felt maybe you were interested because you wanted to protect a particular page... that's not how things are done here) try again. Most people won't hold that you tried before against you. Best wishes. No reply needed but if you do, here is fine, I'll see it.

[Lar]: The problem is, how do you resolve the conflict between consensus and principle, or, how policy normally gets set (it follows consensus, which is based on what people say and do) and how it has been set in this case, it is derived from fundamental principles around what the WP project is, and from (somewhat oracular and thus hard to interpret crisply) statements the founder and chief policymaker has made, rather than based on what popular sentiment at the moment is. I am starting to get increasing sympathy for those that delete outside process, I must say. GT, your you know what touches on this.

[Lar]: Hope those commments are helpful. I'd rather get your personal feedback on them here before I do my general reply.

[Lar]: No, I was in a different channel, a private cabal if you like, I guess you can say, which has much more reasoned discourse than even en-admins... I think it's useful to seek quick guidance, but absolutely feel that one should not take it as a replacement for judgement, and I don't think I do take it so, which is what your words imply, at least to my eyes. That's the major bone to pick here remaining. '''<font color=\""green\"">[[User:Lar\/Esperanza|+]]<\/font>[[Special:Emailuser\/Lar|+]]'''
[Lar]: Yes, see my comments there. My BIG learning so far is that I did not explain this well at all, that close statement wasn't any good. Usually I'm more verbose, but I really wanted to try to get 6 June closer to archivable.. it still has some thorny ones in there yet like the Lightsaber one (go try to make sense of that one!). As for mentioning DRV, I believe strongly in accountability, if I thought it was close, I wanted to not give the sense I wasn't open to review and feedback. '''<font color=\""green\"">[[User:Lar\/Esperanza|+]]<\/font>[[Special:Emailuser\/Lar|+]]'''

[Lar]: Oh! You said \""I guess we have slightly different approaches to how one might handle an AfD that one is unsure of.\""... There's an essay in there no doubt. So maybe the question to ask here is how DO you handle an AfD you're unsure of? Mine is (if I've decided it has to be me that closes it for whatever reason... perhaps because it's old) to seek additional input and to review the article, the comments, the contribution histories of the commentors, and weigh things. I'm not fond of relists as it seems to just postpone the issue a bit, but sometimes they're the way to go...

[Lar]: That confuses me, sorry. If you don't think your contributions are positive then what does that mean? ++
[Lar]: Accountability? you mean like [[:Category:Administrators open to recall]]? I think we may have to agree to disagree about this user, I think they have not been civil at all, regardless of admin actions. That said, I think there is merit in my letting some other admin deal with it next time. The problem is that every admin that this user interacts with eventually makes this user's animus list.  (and thus is disqualified?) Fortunately we have a lot of admins but it seems a bad practice. ++
[Lar]: Cyde is right, more later, but I am concerned about the notion that contributions give you a free pass, or that if an admin is a little bit uncivil it gives the other party a free pass in some people's eyes. That's just wrong. It's not about wmarsh leaving, it's about this culture that seems to value disruptive editors more than hard working admins. ++
[Lar]: As a reminder here's the poll for part 1: [[Wikipedia:State_route_naming_conventions_poll\/Part1]] and sure enough it says nothing about what states it applies to (only that two states get an exemption) ++

[Lar]: I moved [[User talk:Courtney Akins Archive]] to [[User talk:Courtney Akins\/Archive]] for you, because the accepted convention for archives (as with any other subpages in user space or user talk space) is to use a slash separator. Also, there conceivably some day could be a user named \""Courtney Akins Archive\"" although I kinda doubt it. ++
[Lar]: Note that as I understand policy,if users are acting like sock or meatpuppets (or acting like the same user) it doesn't matter *what( the CU results are, if the action is circumventing a block, the other users are blockable as well. I think this unblock was incorrect. Please bring this to AN\/I so consensus can be sought. ++
[Lar]: Your RfA writeup mentions that you've been seeking the courage to stand. I'm glad to see you have, so that I could support, but if during the process you find you need some fortification, I've supplied some liquid courage. There's a brand of [[Courage (brewery)|beer]] from the UK that would have been perfect as an image, but I couldn't source a free pic so this Irish beer will have to do.

(although it's been my experience with the buying a round process, as practiced in the UK, that getting a round bought early on means only that you're in for more expense later, as later rounds tend to be bigger. Is it that way in Ireland too?) ++

[Lar]: For now: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User%3ALar%2FEssays&diff=112950837&oldid=106093578] till I find a better home, so it's not lost. ++
[Lar]: Hi... I saw this: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_arbitration&diff=129250327&oldid=129246652] .. seemed a reasonable action by a clerk, the case was \""fast tracked\"".  Then I saw this: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&diff=next&oldid=129250327] which totally confused me. Why did you revert NYBrad's action? Seems rather process wonky not to let the case get opened expeditiously. Are you someone that feels process is more important than doing the right thing efficiently? This case has overwhelming votes to open, many arbitrators seem to want it done right away, and NYBrad is a very good clerk. Wasn't it a bit of a slap to him to revert him that way? Aren't you going against consensus of the rest of the arbitration team by standing on process? (...you can answer here, I'll watch...) ++
[Lar]: A few points. First, I think what was being expedited here by NYB was merely ''opening the case'', not ''rushing to a decision''. I don't really see how \""giving the accused time to respond\"" has any actual bearing in this instance, they'll have plenty of time to respond during the case. Also, hasn't the \""accused\"" basically been blowing everyone off for a month already?  Second, while it may be true that \""society needs to be governed by dispassionate law\"", this isn't actually a democracy, nor is it a society... people don't have rights, there is no specific due process to follow, and it's not actually run by the rule of law. What it actually is, is a ''project'' to ''do'' something, to ''make'' something. Arbitration is a means to that end, that of creating an encyclopedia efficiently and harmoniously, not some system of justice that exists for its own sake. That you term your action \""overrule\"" in this matter rather than \""go against apparent consensus\"" strikes me as an issue in its own right... you aren't a judge, just one of us that we selected by consensus to help make things go smoothly. Third, NYB is, in my view, too nice a guy to give you a hard time about making things difficult for him, but that is you did. Once the case was opened, to go ahead and close it again so that it could be around for 24 more hours strikes me as really just a waste of everyone's time for no apparent reason. Fourth, I'm not privy to the arbcom mailing list but I do have to wonder what was said to you privately about this matter. I would be greatly surprised if it was uniformly positive.  In summation, it's my view that you messed up, and you could either dig in now and defend in depth, or just admit that in hindsight it perhaps wasn't the very best idea overall to summarily revert a clerk without discussing it privately with him first. You should apologise for that, and move on. It was a relatively minor mess up but a mess up just the same. ++
[Lar]: I agree with Phil here. I think you may have inadvertantly [[WP:BITE|bitten]] a newcomer. The last thing we want to do is turn an enthusiastic and well intentioned contributor into someone sour on our process who keeps their potential contributions to themselves because we've driven them away. The parkclearly exists, a google search reveals that, and it is clearly notable enough to merit inclusion. The article just needed some work, and instead of tagging, perhaps you could have worked with the user. I hope you find this feedback useful. Happy editing. ++
[Lar]: This seems a particularly inauspicious time to be undeleting things that were deleted for apparently valid BLP concerns. ++
[Lar]: Please keep conversations threaded per my talk page header,thanks. If you'd rather continue at my talk that is fine, let me know.  But all BLP is by definition, urgent, once discovered. Undeletion is just not ever a good idea without first understanding the issues. Which I see no sign you did, all you apparently did was undelete. Not on. ++
[Lar]: Holy smokes, you may want to reconsider remarks like this one: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ADeletion_review%2FLog%2F2007_May_31&diff=135170150&oldid=135157240] as they are totally unacceptable ways to make points. I cautioned you that undeletion of BLP related matters was not prudent. I cannot say it strongly enough, you must not reveal deleted content, it is a violation of the trust the community places in you. Please think long and hard before you apply for reinstatement++
[Lar]: Better safe than sorry. No harm done from a temporary thing like this if all is cleared up? Don't you agree Night Gyr? ++
[Lar]: Also, do you have any strong feeling about actually doing the switch and replacing the original Red Brigades derived flag with this one?... both you and I still have that one in our Rouge Admin badging :) ++
[Lar]: (refactored from my talk, I'll watch here for a bit) Well, the original red brigades one does come up for deletion\/kerfluffle-ing from time to time, as does the group itself... That's why I've thought that changing out the image with the star on it for this one was a good compromise. But no worries I guess. May as well let sleeping dogs lie. I think it's a fine change I guess, although I personally do prefer more cartoony skulls, that one looks rather sinister. So no I won't be reverting it. Thanks for the offer though, it's appreciated. ++
[Lar]: I am no Inkscape maven, that's for sure... but this image was a learning process for me. The original skull and bones image was made by intersecting\/unioning\/differencing shapes and twiddling paths, till I had a close approximation of the bitmapped image I was working from. Getting the text to follow a curved path was a bit challenging since you have to take spacing into account and you can't center it, only start somewhere... Perhaps I should dig up the bitmapped image and link to it in the description box. But since that version is now gone in this image, it doesn't matter. BTW, thanks for the tip on age, it's been done. {{tl|age}} does have the drawback of making your birthday obvious, but if I cared about that I shouldn't have added it to the esperanza calendar way back when :) ++
[Lar]: I added a couple of pics to the article, and a comment on the  talk, that she is named for McDougall's mentor might be worth a mention in the article, what do you think? ++
[Lar]: Thanks for your concern, IvoShandor. I'm an admin on Commons, familiar with licensing requirements, and I'm comfortable these images are going to be fine. Since this is a current DYK nom, it seemed a good idea to get the images into the article, as the capstan, however remarkable (and that Elkman went and got it himself... (did you use an underwater camera??) adds even more), doesn't really convey much information about the uniqueness of this ship and its design. ++
[Lar]: Your article inspired me... I did some tinkering with the [[whaleback]] article to tighten it up, as well as the [[SS Meteor]] and then pounded out [[Christopher Columbus (whaleback)]] ... hopefully two whaleback articles up at nearly the same time won't be too big a deal. I was always fond of whalebacks as a boy and had forgotten all about them. The Wilson went down not far from the place of her birth since she was built in Superior. My researches gave me enough material to do an article on McDougall and his company [[American Steel Barge Company]] as well, if I get inspired. And congrats on the barnstar, it's definitely earned. ++
[Lar]: Hi, please see [[User_talk:Concerniokw]], and [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard%2FIncidents&diff=158650693&oldid=158650336 this] AN\/I post. I'd ask you to strongly consider removing your comment. This is, in my considered judgement, and per checkuser investigation, a garden variety disruptive sock, part of a huge nest of basically vandalism only socks, not an aggrieved good faith contributor who needs an alternate ID to make important points anonymously. Thanks for your consideration. ++
[Lar]: Wow. Well done! Time flies when you're having fun, eh? ++
[Lar]: I'd have to think REALLY hard about that one, I reckon. But thanks for the vote of confidence. ++
[Lar]: Hi... I think you closed this keep but it seems like the AFD notice is still on the article. Did you mean to leave it for some reason? Thanks. ++
[Lar]: No worries. Coming here meant that I noticed my name mentioned, above... is that NOAA image thing all sorted then? ++
[Lar]: Congrats. I look forward to working with you here as well. ++
[Lar]: Are you still wanting to vanish? I'm confused. If you are, let us know and your pages can be deleted as you wish, but if you are not, please consider removing the threat to vandalize that is at the top of your page. If it's a threat you mean, then I'm not sure you fit in here, and if it's a threat you don't mean, I don't think it should remain. Just some friendly advice. ++
[Lar]: I'd just edit it away from the top of this page and that would be that. You can edit your own user and user talk pages, it's when you repeatedly delete warnings that some admins get concerned. Hope that helps. ++
[Lar]: Hi Mattisse. I have been requested ([[User_talk:Lar#Mattisse_and_mediation|at my talk page]]) to bring [[Wikipedia:Requests for mediation\/Caisson (Asian architecture)]] to your attention, since you have been named as a party. I was told that you were told about it already but may have overlooked it or inavertantly deleted it en masse. Typically it is considered polite to respond to such requests, even if your response is that you do not wish to participate. Would you be so kind as to take the time to respond at the page? You can respond in the section [[Wikipedia:Requests_for_mediation\/Caisson_%28Asian_architecture%29#Parties.27_agreement_to_mediate]]. I hope this has been helpful to you, happy editing.  (feel free to respond here if you want to discuss this with me, or at my talk page, as you like, but I may refactor to keep threads together)... ++
[Lar]: I saw you deleted quite a bit of text in [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Brian_Epstein&diff=prev&oldid=176791959 this] edit. I think maybe that ought to be taken to the talk page of the article? I didn't see why it was deleted in the edit summary... ++
[Lar]: No worries, makes sense to me. Recording it on the article talk page does sometimes help avoid random bystanders (<- me) from popping by and asking questions though. :) Happy editing. ... <small>count me in the \""''died laughing'' about your userid\"" column, by the way<\/small> ++
[Lar]: To elaborate this is called crosslinking...  Anyway you need to crosslink your account. You can do this by doing an edit here (to your user page, perhaps) saying you have an account on Meta named Crockspot, and then on Meta, giving the diff of that post (about the account) on en saying it is you on en. Or you can if you want set up a fullblown [[m:User:Lar\/WikiMatrix|WikiMatrix]] like my userpage on Meta references. (it's really best that it is something that one does for ones self). Once you do this it also counts for board elections.  ++
[Lar]: |} The guinea pigs having said this is good enough, I'm working my way through the A's ++
[Lar]: {{User:lar\/catmsg}} ...My guinea pigs and the \""A\""s having felt this message was OK to go forward with, today it's the turn of the \""B\""s and \""C\""s! I'm hoping at least one of you chaps will point to their own criteria instead of mine :)... it's flattering but scary! :) ++
[Lar]: |} ...My guinea pigs and the \""A\""s through \""H\""s having felt this message was OK to go forward with (or at least not complained bitterly to me about it :) ),  today it's the turn of the \""I\""s, \""J\""s,  and \""K\""s! I'm hoping that more of you chaps\/chapettes will point to their own criteria instead of mine :)... it's flattering but a bit scary! :) Also, you may want to check back to the table periodically, someone later than you in the alphabet may have come up with a nifty new idea. ++
[Lar]: Please DO get an official clarification on this before making the request at meta, so that whatever steward handles the request is not put in the position of having to decide if you \""really mean it\"" or not, or if they don't know about the clause, turn you off and then you perhaps later turn up and ask a 'crat for it back because you decided you didn't get the clause you seek. I hope that's clear :)... (I won't be the steward handling the request, this being one of my home wikis) ++
[Lar]: I think this motion resolves the ambiguity that would have given a steward pause in accepting a request from you that was conditionally worded. For reference, you can ask for permission removal at  [[m:Requests_for_permissions]]. You will need to provide crosslinking to identify and validate yourself, filling out and using the template at the top of the page to set up your request will do it for you. (a statement here on your own talk page that you are doing the request on meta would suffice as the \""local request link\"" that you need to give the diff of over there) Please advise if that is not clear or if I can be of any assistance. ++
[Lar]: Done by [[m:user:DerHexer]] 16:05, 14 January 2008 (UTC) - [http:\/\/meta.wikimedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Requests_for_permissions&diff=834298&oldid=834291 diff] ... You have my compliments for having resolved this in a much more seemly and gracious manner than I feared would be the case. Best wishes. ++
[Lar]: I'd appreciate your not repeating that tagging, because I agree with A. B., tagging active pages as historical is indeed likely to be viewed as disruption by more than one admin. ++
[Lar]: Hi, I noticed you are archiving some of this year's discussion. Thanks for that! Do you think you might be able to also create archived versions of the AFMP? I think someone did so for last year but this years is now gone, near as I can tell. Unless I was looking in the wrong place. I'm thinking that since this is now a 3 year old tradition, an archive structure that didn't just use the standard archive box might be better ... some sort of embedded template that all the talk pages carry that shows, by year, the main page, the main page talk, the DYK talk pate, the FA talk page, etc. It might be a bit much to do but might also avoid some rediscovery\/reinvention each year. I noticed this because my blog link to yesterday's main page is already stale and I was trying to find what to link to... what do you think? ++
[Lar]: K! Did. Thx. ++
[Lar]: Note that one red link from the deletion of [[Wikipedia:Verifiability]] is on every single edit page... oh I think you just fixed it. :) Seeing red THERE made me do a double take! ++
[Lar]: I blame you (and moreso our move vandal, I just closed his AfD nom for him) for the database locks just now, that page is referenced from a gazillion places ... :) ++
[Lar]: FYI I ran a check as part of trying to close the AfD. I updated the report, you may want to review it. ++
[Lar]: I strongly prefer leaving convos in one place... you strongly prefer them not... I want to let you know I goofed, please check that page again, it doesn't say what it used to at all ! ( :( at me for goofing). As for the other IP you pointed out, I did check it.  It's not technically correlated to either of the IDs, just as they are not correlated to each other. But the editing pattern supports assuming association... as with the others. Let's keep this convo here, I'll watchlist your page for a while. ++
[Lar]: (as a side note, redirecting the talk to the user page makes things (1 click) harder for CUs, as it suppresses the list of handy links on the talk page which are very useful...) ++
[Lar]: If the pattern is strong, treat as a meatpuppet rather than a sock. This case, someone using different connections and machines would fit the observed stuff returned by CU, as would multiple people. I think the blocks probably are sound enough. You might offer to unblock the main account on a committment to not repeat the behaviour pattern. ++
[Lar]: I am glad to see your editing privs restored. ++
[Lar]: Done. Thank you for your contributions, and best wishes. ++
[Lar]: Thanks. ++
[Lar]: If you mean me, I calls them like I sees them. [[WP:DUCK]] doesn't only apply to socks, you know. ++
[Lar]: Ya, I think that one speaks for itself. This isn't PoT. PoT said no other sock will be used when he needs to speak for himself. Near as I can tell (and as you know from reading the pages yourself) PoT is not seeking mentorship, either. Just peaceful editing far away from policy pages. ++
[Lar]: I sincerely hope that Ncmvocalist is not allowed to clerk anything related to ArbCom. I do not think his approach is suited to the task, and some of the things done already by Ncmvocalist have been, in my view, rather counter productive... (in particular \""pestering\"" arbs is not what is needed...)  If there is a better place to give this input please advise and I will do so. ++
[Lar]: You raise some important issues, and highlight some serious problems, but your message might be lost in among the rhetoric, you know, inflammatory statements like \""kiss my ass\"", \""looking idiotic\"", calling ''me'' \""level-headed\"", terming someone \""colossally prejudiced\"", and mentioning \""wheel-war his stupid ass\"" as a good idea... you might want to see if you can refactor this a bit. And maybe take a break for a bit... there are lots of other things to do in life, and clearing your head might help. Or come over to Commons more often.  ++
[Lar]: I think you both are edit warring on this article. Please review [[WP:3RR|the three revert rule]] and remember it is a bright line, not an entitlement. I am warning both parties. ++
[Lar]: Just as a note, in the recent case I was in, although a party not named did share presentations with me, I never saw anything evidentiary at all from the other named party. Nothing. Which is odd since that party was the one making the accusations. That party has made rather a large statement about how they never saw anything at all, but cast in a way that makes the problem seem one sided. It was not a one sided problem at all in that case. Your suggestion on how to do these sorts of cases seems exceedingly sound. ++
[Lar]: Sehr Gut! Viele Gl\xfcck! ++
[Lar]: Mattisse... edits like [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Medicine&diff=260598845&oldid=260598412 this one] just are not good. Not what we expect from seasoned contributors. Way too blatantly assuming bad faith and needling a fellow contributor. I've not followed your contributions closely but I'm not liking what I've seen... as I commented at Che, your approach may not be suitable. At all. I think you need to revisit it. ++
[Lar]: I am pretty busy myself. So you can assume that if I left you a message, I felt \""this issue is so important that it warrants a message to\"" [you] \""from\"" [me]... As far as \""following around and accusing of underhanded dealings\"" goes, I think you've the wrong end of the stick. My suggestion is that you stop needling people and stop assuming bad faith. ++
[Lar]: I think focusing on how to improve your own interactions with others, rather than worrying about others, or about Wikipedia in general, or how I choose to spend my time, or what brings matters to my attention, would be the best use of your time. ++
[Lar]: I'm concerned about the ''pattern of behaviour'' not just the particular edit. That edit is one example of many. Again, focus on your own behaviour instead of attacking all and sundry unless they 100% agree with you, and instead of seeking conspiracies and the like. ++
[Lar]: I was just popping in here to speak to you about another article that I think you may have closed a bit early. I would just ask you to give the matter serious thought and if there is any dissent whatever, don't SNOW close things. ++
[Lar]: OK good deal. I'm not even going to mention the article, that's not the point, although I guess I could... just do think. 'nuff said, best wishes. ++
[Lar]: You got a response. Issues #1 and #2 of Icestorm815's list are being discussed already, I hope you both will join in the discussion of them (and the rest too). ++
[Lar]: Just to follow up, I removed the permission (Heather hasn't been editing since November 2008), but if you disagree with that feel free to ask me to put it back or do so yourself. ++
[Lar]: I suggest you not revert that addition again. This has been raised at AN and AN\/I. I'm not uninvolved but I imagine there are plenty of uninvolved admins who would be willing to block you for edit warring if you did. ++
[Lar]: The antidote to insularity is wider participation. I think the better place to start seeking fresh eyes is on the guidelines themselves rather than the debates, but ya... glad to. Time permitting, of course. (Most of my en:wp time today was spent CUing). ++
[Lar]: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArbitration%2FRequests%2FCase&diff=311321581&oldid=311320689] :) (although I undid mine, not knowing you'd added yours, thinking mine not that funny, perhaps I should re-revert myself and then block myself for edit warring?... but I digress)  That is a very odd page indeed... we actually have page titles that start with http:\/\/ ??? and whats more, that page gets views? ++
[Lar]: You need to work on your [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAitias&diff=312575103&oldid=312516588 edit summaries]. I was giving friendly advice, hoping for a collegial conversation, but if you want we can move to warnings, up to you. Because you're on a bad path. ++
[Lar]: OK then, have it your way, going forward, I'll only come by when I feel the need to warn you about something, or let you know you've been blocked. Try to manage your affairs so I never feel the need to come by. Best wishes. ++
[Lar]: Ottava: Suppose for the sake of argument that Antandrus is part of a massive conspiracy with the single focus of making your life miserable in every way possible. Guess what? He's still right about your approach being not the best. If you change your approach, things will go a lot more smoothly for you. You're an amazing contributor, with an astounding ability to get things done. But that's in spite of your working style, not because of it. Think how much more productive you'd be if people clamored to spend time with you instead of cringed when you appeared, but put up with it for the sake of getting work done. Take that for what you like. ++
[Lar]: Congratulations. I've taken a final pass through and promoted the article [[Laguna Canyon]] to [[WP:GA|Good Article]] status. It was a \""good article\"" when we started and now it's ''great''! I had a couple more suggestions but that's all they are, suggestions. Thanks for all your efforts on this (and other) article(s). I know it took us a while but I think the delay was well worth it. Good luck in your future endeavors, I hope we get to work together again, it's been a pleasure. Best wishes. ++
[Lar]: Have things changed a lot on starting projects? I wasn't aware admin consent was required. When [[User:Kingboyk|Kingboyk]] and I started [[WP:BEATLES]] neither of us were admins. Anyway I've voiced my support. ++
[Lar]: I know what the guidelines say... but one of my earliest GA noms was quickfailed when those of us working on it were sure it could be fixed in a week. Much acrimony ensued. I'll never fail an article for time reasons if I think the editor(s) are working on it, however slowly. But don't count on other GA reviewers feeling that way. I dabble, at best, and it may be explicitly counter-policy to be patient, not sure. Best. ++
[Lar]: I agree, it is wheel warring. Ask ArbCom for an injunction to support the block, if you're sure you are right. ++
[Lar]: Thank you. ++
[Lar]: Do you consider yourself an \""uninvolved admin\"" with respect to [[WP:GS\/CC\/RE]]? ++
[Lar]: The question is specific enough without reference to any particular ''section'' of that page, and admits of a yes or no answer as posed. ++
[Lar]: We are all of us going to be \""involved\"" in whatever specific discussion we are having, so perhaps it's sophistry to point it out. However, with respect to that particular one, if I'm asking neutral questions, and you're advocating a particular point of view, you're far more involved, even under your own peculiar definition, than I am.  That said, the question is about the topic area as a whole. Please confine your answer to the question asked, if you would be so kind. Sorry if that was unclear. As it happens I have already made my own determination of the matter and acted, but the question is nevetheless of interest ++
[Lar]: Ok, then. You may take that view if you wish but the question admits of a direct yes or no answer, unlike your rhetorical dodge. They are not equivalent. Your repeated refusal to answer a simple yes or no question with a \""yes\"" or \""no\"" is all I need though, the answer is plain enough from your refusal, and I adjudge you to not be an \""uninvolved admin\"" within the scope of the topic area. Going forward any comments by you in the \""result concerning...\"" section of any enforcement request are subject to removal to the section immediately above them, as I have recently done with \""Result concerning ZP5, AQFK, ATren\"". You are welcome to challenge that determination, in the proper form and manner, should you so choose. However you are not welcome to unilaterally move things back or to post in that or any other similar section again. ++
[Lar]: It is my view as an uninvolved admin. You are welcome to contest it, in the proper forum, but I intend to act on it as I see fit. In accordance with our norms. The \""topic area\"" is the entire area covered by the [[Wikipedia:General sanctions\/Climate change probation]] in accordance with the definition currently in effect there. I'm not seeing much more to say here given your unwillingness to engage in meaningful dialog. ++
[Lar]: Don't worry SBHB, I don't rise to bait like [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:William_M._Connolley&diff=next&oldid=353779930]. Or were you worried about something else? You need to change your approach. You all do. ++
[Lar]: Apologies for any confusion. I thought you were perhaps raising material that SBHB then correctly characterized as ''baiting '''by''' Stephan Schulz''. Why would I think that? On the face of it, those posts by him look like baiting to me! That's why.  So I would HOPE SBHB would warn Stephan Schulz about it and urge him to desist. It's excellent advice.  But perhaps that's not what SBHB was doing. Perhaps he was egging him on. Can't be sure. ++
[Lar]: I think you may be confused, and a careful reread may help clear that up. The diffs show baiting BY Stephan, and SBHB does sometimes speak in riddles. Also, I don't believe that Stephan wants to be called SS. Hope that helps. ++
[Lar]: I'm happy to further discuss my perceived bias. (on my talk page, not here) I'd think a good starting point would be for you, Stephan Schulz, to articulate ''exactly'' what you think it is. Be specific. But I find myself in agreement with ATren, I'm less involved in editing in the area itself (i.e. essentially zero edits) than several of the other admins who are active at the enforcement page, and who I consider uninvolved, and I am less active. My role so far has been purely commentary and clerical, I don't believe I've actually blocked anyone yet. I think you (and SBHB, and WMC, and others) need to stop the snark. If you want to pursue the matter further after the discussion about bias I propose, I'm [[User:Lar\/Accountability|recallable]]. But please stop the snark. It's just not helpful. ++
[Lar]: Assumes facts not in evidence.  I'm happy to further discuss my perceived bias. (on my talk page, not here) ++
[Lar]: I see this isn't going very well as conversations go. I appreciate your barnstar. I appreciate your desire to bring WMC to account for snarking about it. But I must caution you that we do give editors wide latitude on their own pages and if WMC tells you you're not welcome, you're not. The only allowable exception under policy to that is if you are giving routine notifications or warnings and there is reason for them. So, I'd say just let it go. Trust me, it will work out better. Playing the martyr (\""I don't care if I'm blocked\"") is way overrated. If you really feel the need to comment and just can't resist, you can always find a talk page where the owner doesn't sweep things under the rug willy nilly and doesn't tell people he takes a dislike to that they have to go away, and comment there instead... if you pick the right page you'll find that your message gets through anyway. But taking the high road is the better approach. Easy advice to give. Hard advice to take. Hope it helps though. ++
[Lar]: They were interesting answers indeed. But I was referring to the question that starts out \""Ah. Thanks for clarifying. I think I see the source of the confusion... \"" ++
[Lar]: That's rather a novel interpretation. Stop playing games. Place, or move back, a comment of yours in the uninvolved admin section, or move one of mine out, and there will be consequences. ++
[Lar]: I don't edit in the topic area. And my constructive Wikipedia contributions are somewhat shorter at only 5 or so years. But other than that we're the same, yes. However, editing in the topic area is what matters. Stephan Schulz does edit there, I do not. Further, the other uninvolved admins find me uninvolved. They do not find Stephan Schulz uninvolved. ++
[Lar]: I'm uninvolved. He's not. The determination of this has been made, so far, by the uninvolved admins. Perhaps that will change. I suppose I could ask ArbCom for a ruling on it. ++
[Lar]: It's been mine all along. Some don't like that. Hence their machinations. I'd say it looks like one team trying to remove a ref they don't like because he's too impartial for their taste. ++
[Lar]: Get your request ready, then. The other uninvolved admins find me uninvolved and have said so repeatedly. That should do for you. I have no plans to stop participating as an uninvolved admin. You can't take me out of the game with this ploy. ++
[Lar]: No, you've misunderstood me. I'm uninvolved. The other uninvolved admins agree. You need to get over it. Don't interfere with the working of the board, because THAT is disruption. But this probably belongs on my talk, as I came here to warn Stephan, not debate you. ++
[Lar]: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk%3AWilliam_M._Connolley&action=historysubmit&diff=364466825&oldid=364446772 This] was a good comment, I think. ++
[Lar]: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk%3AWilliam_M._Connolley&action=historysubmit&diff=364466825&oldid=364446772 This] was a good comment, I think. ++
[Lar]: I need to do better at noting positive things. But you may well want to start thinking about who actually is ruder and taking the appropriate level of action instead of demurring from taking a stance. ++
[Lar]: I need to do better at noting positive things. But you may well want to start thinking about who actually is ruder and taking the appropriate level of action instead of demurring from taking a stance. ++
[Lar]: You were mentioned on same, toward the bottom. Seems to be regarding this diff: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Collect&diff=prev&oldid=366181125]. I just got up after a very late flight and an unplanned 2.5 hour drive home and am not sure what it's all about. Just thought you might want to know. ++
[Lar]: I'm not sure badgering Stephan is a good approach. A sockpuppet investigation is not like a murder investigation, and the standards of evidence are much lower. ++
[Lar]: Polargeo, I'm not sure you're being very helpful here either. It may be a better approach to try being a bit less blustery. Better, could we all just take the point that small sample phrase correlation isn't always accurate and drop this? ++
[Lar]: Unless I am much mistaken, I'm not sure you're at all clear on what point Collect is actually trying to make here. It has little or nothing to do with statistics, and your repeated reference to stats suggests you've failed to grasp that. But as I said, I think the point has already been made, ''more'' than adequately, and at this point nothing useful is being added. At least not directly useful anyway, although lots of interesting diffs are being generated. So I suggest it be dropped and everyone move on. ++
[Lar]: Full marks for trying. Thanks. ++
[Lar]: Please also note my request at the end of [[Wikipedia_talk:Arbitration\/Requests\/Case\/Climate_change\/Workshop#Note:_Connolley_has_violated_the_terms_one_of_his_probations_yet_again]]... BTW, do you prefer the no caps version of your userid (which is what it is) or the version with CamelCase (which is how you sign)? Thanks. ++
[Lar]: As would I. This entire conversation is an excellent illustration of the many problems with this faction. When one person is asked to explain or answer, others join in and evade, then take umbrage on being called on that. Simple questions, put directly, are answered with evasion over and over, and attacks on the questioner thrown in for good measure. StS, you say you have several alternate explanations. Put some forward then. WMC, why are you unwilling to answer the questions asked you directly? Do you think no one notices your tactics? ++
[Lar]: Accusing me of being in a faction with \""Scibaby\""? That needs redaction, soonest. ++
[Lar]: You need to include a smiley or some other marker. Given that you don't seem to have any ability for accepting humor, that's the least that can be expected. I nevertheless expect a redaction, or at least clarifying remark, at my talk. ++
[Lar]: I've started a thread here: [[Wikipedia_talk:General_sanctions\/Climate_change_probation\/Requests_for_enforcement#Unilateral_modification_of_active_sanction]]. I think it would be better to gain consensus for such a modification. It may well be that consensus exists. But if we modify that way based on principle, there are other sanctions that may need modification as well. So I invite you to discuss this. ++

[Lar]: I don't believe that's appropriate, the way to go is seek consensus at [[Wikipedia:General sanctions\/Climate change probation\/Requests for enforcement]], which I have put forward at AN\/I. ++
[Lar]: With respect, ANI is the audience with a larger number of inexperienced and non admin participants. Seeking consensus at GSCC is the right thing to do. I suggest you do so. Because, with respect, I don't see the consensus at ANI that you claim to. It may well be that consensus exists, but so far you haven't shown it. ++

[Lar]: (moved from the PD talk page, better suited here) ''\""Lar, have you ever written a proposed decision for an arbitration case?\"", \""Without exception, those participating in a case see their case as THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ARBCOM HAVE TO DEAL WITH (tm). \""'' ... those both were ''completely'' uncalled for remarks, in my view, so I rebutted them.  Sorry if you didn't like the smackdown, but you were ''pwned''. I'll stop trying to score debating points on you if you do the same for me. You first. ++
[Lar]: Take a pass through the last 8 months of my user talk some time if you want to see antagonism. It's been a constant incoming barrage. I'm just tired of it all. Tired of that faction and their continued passive aggressive (or outright aggressive) behavior, and how it's colored my own. Fight against something long enough and you run the danger of turning into it. Maybe I'm doing myself no favors by being so caustic, but I really have about had it. How many more messengers get shot before the message gets across? You guys just do not seem to get it yet. Instead you rag on me too. ++
[Lar]: Thanks for reading it. As a note, there is an important difference between explaining factors behind behavior, and claiming an excuse for it. I've explained, but I'm not claiming that it's OK that I lose my temper or act in ways that are not exemplary. In fact I regret it and I would prefer to do better. Hal peridol might take note of that, as that's an important distinction to aid him in his apparent confusion. ++
[Lar]: I'm not sure exactly what the fix is, but this system isn't working, and it's worse in this case than many. Arbs should have used the workshop page like everyone else instead of closing it for a month, then proposing stuff without a proper vehicle for give and take. The older way in which the workshop wasn't segregated by originator may be better... segregate the proposals by topic instead. Then arbs can move the ones they truly are ready to vote on to the PD page. ++
[Lar]: Your questions have been answered. I'm interested in your thoughts, as well as those of others and now that I've answered, would like to invite comment by others. It's odd that these questions were asked on the PD page... they seem much more workshoppy. ++
[Lar]: Way to go Dana... you passed with nary a neigh vote. Er, I mean nay vote. Now get to work! ++
[Lar]: Although the remedy \""Lar is an uninvolved admin but advised\"" looks likely to fail at this point (but that could change, who knows), I do plan to (as Carcharoth suggests) take the advice given on board, and step aside to let other admins try to resolve this matter. I am dubious whether this will work out well, since the decision fails to meaningfully acknowledge or tackle the factionalism and skewed battlefield, and leaves a lot of the worst participants unmentioned, much less advised, but I am going to give it a rest and see what happens. ++
[Lar]: The case isn't over, Tony. There are still proposals being made. Asking someone to not participate in the case isn't reasonable if they are possibly going to be impacted by it. Wait till the case is put to bed and if you still see worrisome behavior, speak out then. Make sure you're speaking out about all the problems you see and not just those on one side though. ++
[Lar]: On the contrary it's very good advice to everyone involved... speak out about all problems you see and not just those on one side. Is there some reason you disagree? ++
[Lar]: Yes, I agree my comments are pertinent. So are yours and so are those of many others. I'm not sure where you were going with that. ++
[Lar]: I hope that's everyone else's reading too. A fresh approach by fresh folk is needed. ++
[Lar]: I've deleted it for you, ATren. Please advise of any questions or concerns. ++
[Lar]: I think your avenues to seek redress are with the volunteer coordinator(s) and the WMF board. ++
[Lar]: Contacting the volunteer coordinator to ask about something is not at all a high bar, in my view. It's a pretty routine action. Or used to be. As for resigning, the thought has crossed my mind, yes. ++
[Lar]: IIRC \""another day on the wiki\"" was the phrasing Jimbo used when this was first brought to him. ++

You are invited to answer them if you so choose. I suggest that the talk page of your questions page is a good place to put them and I will do so with your acquiescence (for example, SirFozzie's [[Wikipedia_talk:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2010\/Candidates\/SirFozzie\/Questions#Questions_from_Lar|page]] already has them as do the majority of other candidates). Your answers, (or non-answers should you decide not to answer them), that will be a factor in [[User:Lar\/ACE2010|my evaluation]] of your candidacy.

[Lar]: Were you planning on responding to this? ++
[Lar]: Probably moot at this point but Bali's right and WSC's off the mark giving him a hard time. IMHO. ++
[Lar]: Since the section \""NPA on an article talk page\"" does read like a personal attack to me, or presumably to anyone at all that doesn't have context, I've removed it. I've also written ArbCom as you suggest. If they answer in a way that suggests that your section should be allowed to remain, I'll gladly restore it. Otherwise I suggest you leave it removed until the matter is resolved. Thanks for your understanding and cooperation as we endeavor to keep this a civil and friendly environment. ++
[Lar]: PS, write me if you would like me to forward you a copy of what I sent to ArbCom for your records. ++
[Lar]: I'm not angry with you. I just think you are exceedingly confused and your comments often don't help matters in the slightest. Hence I think if you're doing more harm than good, you ought to step away. ... a lot of people ought to. You're not as bad as jps who is totally out of control lately but still... As a note, that input wasn't a \""lash out at random\""... Mathsci is a bit confused too.  If you want to continue this discussion I recommend my talk page, where comments don't get censored or removed if they're inconvenient. ++
[Lar]: As for SBHB taking up the admin bit again? I don't think that's a good idea at all. Perhaps after SBHB goes a few months without snarking? ++
[Lar]: You guys are so predictable. :) ++
[Lar]: Many Happy Returns! ++
[Lar]: I see you are in [[CAT:AOTR]], but it appears that you may be inadvertantly listed. That may be because the only page of yours that carries the category is [[User talk:Trebor\/archive3]]. Having a category membership only on an archive page is perhaps a bit odd, so I would like to ask if that what you intended? Or did you intend not to be in it at all? I let folk know when I spot things like this because some folk use the number of category entries to count the number of admins actually so committed.

Khosrow II,False,"[Khosrow II]: Im just sick and tired of these anon users making ridiculous and useless edits! chances are they will never become constructive. WIkipedia should make everyone have to register before editing, that will definetly take care of people who just want to mess things up.
[Khosrow II]: [[User:Baristarim]] continually attacks pages without reason, and along with his other pan Turk friends tries to push propaganda and POV on several articles. He is currently attack the Iranian's notice board page, claiming its a place where we recruit \""meat puppets\"" where infact it is a place where we can post articles that are in urgent need of attention, such as the Ottoman Empire article where him and his friend claim that Persian and Arabic cultures had no affect, where infact, its exactly the opposite (see talk page). Please do something about this user.
[Khosrow II]: Please tell that to the other User, he blatantly is ignoring Inshahee's warning.
[Khosrow II]: Are you kidding me? I was not even the first to call you a pan Turk. It was evident by your edits that you have some agenda. Its funny that you also dont debate with sources, just your POV. You were proven wrong on several occasions yet you still refuse to understand that things are based on facts, not POV. You go as far as saying that the University of Texas is not a reliable source. And the Culture of the Ottoman empire is as the title says, '''about the culture''', yet you want to take out all references to Arabic and Iranian culture, which made up the culture of the Ottoman Empire.
[Khosrow II]: As I said, I would come to you first. Look at this: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Azerbaijan_Democratic_Republic&action=history] User Baristarim removed a whole sourced section, which also had a link to the main article, which was even more sourced. I will be reverting it, and now you know why, so talk to Baristarim. I have re inserted it now, added more to it, and neutralized it according to the talk on the discussion page of the main page of the article.
[Khosrow II]: Again, he reverted on another article: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=List_of_Azerbaijanis&curid=774820&diff=80742801&oldid=80735918] The term Azerbaijani was not even in use until the late 19th century, when the Russians started using it to seperate a sect of Turkic speakers that were of Iranian descent. The three figures he insists on keeping in lived about 1000 years before, therefore they could not have been Azeri. Also, they were Persians at the time, since the region had not yet been Turkified.
[Khosrow II]: He reverted again, even though I made changes... I also left a message on his talk page. Also, I hope he does not revert again, but if he does, I'll let you take care of it (I already reverted once on accident LOL).
[Khosrow II]: Interesting, he reverted my message on his talk page: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Baristarim&diff=prev&oldid=80752111].
[Khosrow II]: Im not giving you orders. Remember I told you that from now on I will show you all of my edits and what is going on, this is what I'm doing. This way, we can avoid revert wars and arguments before they happen. Also, as I told you, the term Azerbaijani is only a little bit more than 100 years old. Certainly we cannot call 1000 year old figures as Azeri's, and we definetly cannot call them Azeri's from the R. of Azerbaijan since they were all born in Iran. Thats like calling [[Avicenna]] Uzbek...
[Khosrow II]: Thanks for reverting yourself, but it still amazes me why you would just blatantly revert like that, taking out a whole section that was sourced. Even if you had a problem with it, you could have made it more neutral. But as of now, I have made it more neutral according to the agreement me, Ali, and Grandmaster have come to on the main article's talk page.
[Khosrow II]: And the other souces does not come from the \""Iranian Chamber of Commerce\"" LOL. Its the Iranian Chamber Society. A very reliable source for information on Iran. Besides, its just an interview with a historian about the subject, who also scites his sources.
[Khosrow II]: I wrote ''in'' his edit? What do you mean? I wrote under him. Thanks.
[Khosrow II]: What? He wrote that. Check my edit history. This is what I'm talking about. You seem to have this pre conceived notion about me, I dont know where you even got it from: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASarah_Ewart&diff=80754146&oldid=80753594] He wrote that in hismelf. Please be more observant next time, I dont want to be blamed for things I didnt do. Also, I want to know why you even assumed it was me that did that when it was obviously part of his own message that he wrote?
[Khosrow II]: Its not about what Turkey can do on its own or not, its about what [[Mossad]] is doing in Turkey and norther Iraq. Also, please post some historian e-mail addresses. By the way, the .edu and .org ones are if a historian works for a university or some other organization. Dr. Kaveh Farrokh does not work for either, he is independent as far as I know. He writes books and contributes to historical lectures, etc... Right now, I have an .edu e-mail because I got to a university, does that mean I'm important? No. University e-mails are just like AOL or Yahoo, there is no difference. I still use my Yahoo e-mail as well as my university e-mail. I take no special pride in either one, its just an e-mail address. I dont even know what your talking about, its pretty ludicrous.
[Khosrow II]: Also, I will let you know right now that me, Ali, and Grandmaster have already come to a conclusion and a neutral version of the History of the name Azerbaijan article after literally weeks (if not a couple months) of discussion. The last thing the article needs is a new editor who is not familiar with the extent of the discussion we had. Look at the talk page, unless you want to read all of that, its best to leave it as it is.
[Khosrow II]: It probably is a bug, for me it doesnt not appear as it does for you, and I did not add that sentence, he did himself. Also, when did I say you or anyone else cant edit anything? I merely suggested to Baristarim not to jump into a discussion about an article that has been going on for over a month. We have right now come to a conclusion that satisfies all sides, we have stopped edit warring, and we have stopped revert warring. The last thing needed now is for a user unfamiliar with the subject to restart the edit warring, do you know what I mean? I'm merely telling Baristarim that we have already discussed that article and gotten the dispute over with. Im even inclinded to say that it may even acheive featured status. Anyway, I'm going to sleep. I think this idea I have come up with is a really good idea, and it has already prevented several edit wars. Thanks for your help. I'll be keepin in touch like this again.
[Khosrow II]: He says that it is spamming and that its repetitive. Its a summarized section leading to the main article, and it is ownly posted where it is relevant, I dont see anything wrong with it, do you? Its just like how the Azerbaijan article has sections that link to other pages, you know? I think Grandmaster is just trying to keep this information out, thats what it looks like doesnt it? Please, I dont want a revert war, take a look.
[Khosrow II]: Also, the same user reinserted those three figures here: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=List_of_Azerbaijanis&diff=80763370&oldid=80755224] He says that this is not about ethnicity but people who were born in the region. In that case, Sitting Bull was American (as in USA), Montezuma (Aztec King) was Mexican, [[Avicenna]] was Uzbek etc... Hes not making any sense. Also, the R. of Azerbaijan did not even exist at any time in history until 1918, so the region he is referring to, didnt technically exist 1000 then (Becuase the regions origional name was changed for political purposes [see here: [[History of the name Azerbaijan]]], and therefore, them having lived 1000 years before, would not even make them candidates for a list like that).
[Khosrow II]: Hes done it again. Now you are my witness, and I'm showing you who has started the revert war (so dont think its me, like you did the other times). He once again took out the sourced section: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Azerbaijan_Democratic_Republic&diff=80952624&oldid=80952154]\/[http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Azerbaijan&curid=746&diff=80952746&oldid=80952498] and he refuses to talk about why, he just says its POV, despite the fact that its based on the consensus version of the main article which he was involved in making. You can even see for yourself the changes I made to that section to make it neutral according to the main article.
[Khosrow II]: I never said there was consensus on putting the article in relevant sections, I said there was consensus on the article itself, adn therefore the summary, which is in agreement with the main article. And what is wrong with putting in relevant information on relevant articles? And please tell me what is POV about the summary. Why dont you fix the \""POV\"" instead of deleting the whole section? Everything I have ever put in wikipedia is sourced. You have a habit of claiming things as POV and then not mentioned what things your talking about, and also not bringing up the facts to contradict the \""POV\"". Ali Doostzadeh is also complainging about the way you edit wikipedia.
[Khosrow II]: I will be going to sleep now, so I ask that the admins not make a decision until I can come back and make a better case tomorrow (as I believe GM and I are in different time zones, he has the opportunity right now to bring up his case, while I do not). In the mean time, I ask that you read the main article and the summary, and decide for yourself whether they are in agreement or not (now I remind you that the main article is a consensus version acheived with GM's participation). Also, I urge you to consider that the Azerbaijan and ADR articles are relevant places to post this information. I'll say good night for now and I will talk to you tomorrow. Thanks adn I hope you are able to resolve this dispute. For now however, since the sections are sourced, I think they should stay in the respective articles until a final decision is made.
[Khosrow II]: Thanks. Also, could you tell me how to arhive? About the list of Azerbaijani's article, User's like Grandmaster keep reverting everytime me or Ali or someone else changes the intro...
[Khosrow II]: I already showed you the Iranica link that clearly states that those numbers are worthless.
[Khosrow II]: Since this is about Dunn, I would also like to make a complaint. We were debating on another talk page and he just splices my posts and adds his words in between. I keep telling him that its not ok to cut peoples posts with yours and that he should post under other peoples posts. He insists that I shouldnt \""lecture\"" him, but this is what you yourself told me Sarah. I'm also asking him to change his post but he refuses. This may be the same as the case mentioned above.
[Khosrow II]: This is on another talk page, just thought I'd mention it.
[Khosrow II]: This is GM's tactic. He starts revert wars citing ludicrous reasons. Ignores discussions on talk pages as much as he can. Then goes to admins to get pages locked. Please unblock these pages. Thanks.
[Khosrow II]: Thanks for your help, but more and more it becomes evident why Wikipedia is not a very reliable source for information...its sad that such a great thing has such big faults.
[Khosrow II]: Is it ok for people on English Wikipedia to speak in a different language about other User's and topics? (two user's are talking about me and certain articles, and I dont think its ok for them to be doing this)
[Khosrow II]: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMardavich&diff=81974282&oldid=81522878] and [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk%3AGrandmaster&diff=81959948&oldid=81736383].
[Khosrow II]: More disruptive behaviour by GM. In one discussion page, he claims that Brittanica should have the final say in all matters, saying that Brittanica cannot possibly be influenced by outside forces and that it can never make mistakes, etc... Yet he has currently removed sourced information from Brittanica from several articles: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Erivan_Khanate&diff=prev&oldid=82803739] [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Karabakh_khanate&diff=prev&oldid=82804090] [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Ganja_Khanate&diff=prev&oldid=82804538] [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Baku_Khanate&diff=prev&oldid=82805140] This goes to further prove GM's double standard on Wikipedia, certainly an aspect of his POV, and his disruptive behaviour. Also, I will note that GM was pushing several negative quotes that about Iran and when I found the exact same type of quotes about the R. of Azerbaijan (these quotes were regarding assimilation of ethnic minorities, in Irans case in the 1920's abd 30's, in Azerbaijani's case the USSR period and present-day) and put them within articles, he quickly came up with a compromise with Ali to just have none of the quotes mentioned at all, saying that the quotes \""made Azerbaijan look bad\"". Double standard? I think so.
[Khosrow II]: It has just come to my knowledge that GM has been purposely manipulation Brittanica quotes for his own means. Brittanica never says what GM has been claiming it says and using as evidence. I have read the actual text. This is disruptive behaviour, he has purposely been manipulating Brittanica and distorting what it says; this would be classified under historical revisionism and propaganda, but I will leave the decision up to you, since you are an admin, as to what step I should take next regarding GM's behaviour.
[Khosrow II]: Ok sure. I only have access to the regular online version, and from what I read there, Brittanica says nothing that GM claims it says. Thanks for the help.
[Khosrow II]: You are very welcome and I'm the one that should be thanking you. Without your help I probably would have made the same mistakes as before.
[Khosrow II]: Just tell me when we should start talking about the two article and I will write up my comments.
[Khosrow II]: Sure, thats fine with me. Also, are we allowed to comment on the comments section? Because you mentioned something about having other secondary sources, I just want to say that that is exactly what I have done. I have even researched medieval texts written hundreds of years ago to bring up some of the evidence I use. I do not only rely on Brittanica or Iranica or Encarta or what ever, I myself prefer information from before the 20th century, becuase the 20th century has been too greatly influenced by politics and natoinalism to find any real accurate information.
[Khosrow II]: Where do we go from here? GM has been gone for awhile, we cant just wait around forever for him to show up, he may not be back for awhile longer, and who knows, maybe hes purposely inactive for all we know. I think the case has already been made crystal clear on EL_C's talk page. GM doesnt really even have a case, I already met everything he asked for and more, he is just filibustering. THe page has already been locked for more than a week... and I've waited for a decision from El_C for more than a week (hes busy), and this really shouldnt be taking this long for us to finish this.
[Khosrow II]: No, admin [[User:Srikeit|Srikeit]] locked the [[Azerbaijan]] and  [[List of Azerbaijanis]] on GM's versions. I think I have made my case very very clear, and as you can see on El_C's talk page, GM did nothing but filibuster, he couldnt even make a case, all he did was repeat himself over and over again (hes very disruptive, he does this stuff a lot). Have you read El_C's talk page? There is no way that a person could be so busy that they cannot even reply to an e-mail. I check my e-mail several times a day, even at school, and still make time to reply.
[Khosrow II]: Urgent! GM is once again starting an edit war here: [[History of the name Azerbaijan]]. He is trying to push his POV while at the same time saying my edits are POV. I dont have time now, but I will explain everything later, but for now, in confidence of good will in me, could you please lock the article on my last version until we can get this sorted out, and so we can prevent another edit war.
[Khosrow II]: GM, your credibility is already very low, as I have shown that you have a history of behaviour like this. Please do not try to turn this around. I have revealed your distortion on the talk page. The information I took out is due to repetitiveness, because what that quote is saying is already within the article. What Al Hamavi is saying is not what GM wants it to be, GM is distorting it. I am not one to take out sourced information unless I have a good reason that I can support. For example, I have still left the other quote in there, because as of now, I have no way to disprove it or a credible reason for taking it out. However, for this Hamavi quote, I do, and I have shown it. At best, we can add this source to the sentence in the article that says that sometimes many regions were combined into one large province, and add Hamavi's name to the list of figures that clearly distinguish between Azerbaijan and the region in the Caucasus.
[Khosrow II]: Also Sarah, can we speed things up regarding the situation between GM and I on the other two articles?
[Khosrow II]: Thanks for protecting the article for the moment. Sarah, we should start discussing the other two articles seriously, and you need to start making decisions now regarding what is already posted. We can go one for months with discussions, but that wont do any good, I suggest you give us a deadline (like a couple days) and then close the debate, and then you can make a decision regarding our comments. Sound good?
[Khosrow II]: Well, I was the one that suggested El_C moderate between us, but he was too busy. El_C probably wont be able to help out, because he was so busy he couldnt for over a week, so I guess GM will have to just settle with only you.
[Khosrow II]: Good, bring up information from verifiable reliable sources and I will have no problem. Thats what I've been doing all along, nice to see that you have now admitted that you are just now going to do that, as opposed to before.
[Khosrow II]: '''Sarah, its obvious that GM is not even reading my comments. I take the time to sit down, read his comments, and reply, and he cant even take the time to atleast read my comments. How are we going to get anywhere when he is being so disruptive?'''
[Khosrow II]: GM is being very disruptive on the [[History of the name Azerbaijan]] talk page. He purposely ignores what I write, does not respond to anything I say directly, and keeps diverting the discussion and making it go in circles. I dont know what else to do, both him and Ulvi are being very disruptive. Their actions include ignoring what I write, not answering my replies, not answering my questions, and bringing up the same issues over and over again, claiming I have not answered them when the writing is there for everyone to see (I have responded to their repetitive comments time and time again, yet what do I get from them? Nothing but ignoring, they dont even bother to read my posts, atleast thats what it seems like). I dont know what else to do, honestly. Any suggestions? I'm going to bed now, good night.
[Khosrow II]: I have repeatedly answered you, but you ignore what I write. This is evident in the discussion page Sarah created and its evident on the history of the name Azerbaijan article as well. Also, right after I proved Ulvi wrong using his very same source, he just left. And now, you refuse to respond to any of my posts, and you keep making the discussion go in circles. I have answered you plenty of times, and I'm not going to waste my time doing it again, you can re read the discussion page.
[Khosrow II]: The solution is quite simple. Move everyone who is not of the Azerbaijani nationality to their respective pages. Simple as that. Then we wont have such a misinformative and controversial article. There is already a debate going on in the List of Turks article as to why Atila the Hun and the President of the R. of Azerbaijan are in the list, along with others. The very same issue that I have been sayin is avoidable if all the List of .... articles are consistant.
[Khosrow II]: Sarah, I also had a similar ecounter with GM and Ulvi. Ulvi suddenly appeared where ever GM needed help, and then when GM disappeared for awhile so did Ulvi. Suspicious, no?
[Khosrow II]: It kept going in circles because you made it so. You never address the main issues, infact, you avoid them.

[Kralizec!]: Thank you for the message you left on my talk page [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Kralizec%21&diff=next&oldid=212605499].  The first level {{tl|uw-vandalism1}} warning I issued to {{user|216.125.74.4}} was not a mistake as I prefer to AGF when it comes to massively shared IPs that have received zero warnings since last month.  However I am curious as to which part of [[WP:USER]] has been updated that makes it permissible to ''delete'' others' talk page messages and replace them with your own.  --
[Kralizec!]: I do not understand what you mean when you said that you were on RC patrol, as {{user|Delicious carbuncle}} was the one to revert the vandalism, and that was 16 minutes after the fact [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Sandwich&diff=212649160&oldid=212645925], so this instance of vandalism would have never shown up on the recent changes page when you were looking at it 57 minutes later.  The warning I left for this IP was in response to the AIV report made by ''Delicious carbuncle'' [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrator_intervention_against_vandalism&diff=212649357&oldid=212648894], which I declined to block due to the fact that the \""last warning\"" had been issued the previous month.  --
[Kralizec!]: Please do not mark articles as being {{tl|featured article}} when they are not (such as you did [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Dino_Meneghin&diff=prev&oldid=214680429 here] with [[Dino Meneghin]]).  --
[Kralizec!]: Generally I follow a 1RR when it comes to fellow admins, however I am not sure I can agree with your decision to indefinitely block {{user|McSaucePaste}}.  The editor had only received a single warning [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMcSaucePaste&diff=218723065&oldid=218722522], and it was only a {{tl|uw-vand3}}.  More importantly, this individual had not made ''any'' edits since receiving that warning (other than to blank his or her own user talk page).  --
[Kralizec!]: If that is the case, then please accept my apologies.  However next time I might recommend putting something in the block description about it being a vandal sock, as otherwise it looks like an out-of-process block to an un-involved admin.  --
[Kralizec!]: The two speedy deletion notices were just that, notices not warnings like {{tl|uw-create1}} thru {{tl|uw-create4im}}.  Regardless the editor never received a level-four warning for anything, and the last warning he or she received was a level-three.  Considering McSaucePaste apparently took heed of that warning and did not vandalize any more articles, but was blocked anyway ... yes, I call that an out-of-process block (because in essence, the account was blocked after a single level-one warning).  However the knowledge that the account in question is a vandal sock makes it ''not'' an out-of-process block ... which is the point I was trying to make: outside observers like me may not be aware of the history here and\/or sock issue that was the ultimate reason this account was blocked so rapidly.  Without that knowledge, otherwise uninvolved admins like me just see it as an out-of-process block.  --
[Kralizec!]: Perhaps you and I have a philosophical difference of opinion on this, but when I am processing AIV reports (like when McSaucePaste was reported today), I feel that the AIV instructions are very important, especially the part about vandals must have been given sufficient warnings.  When it comes to McSaucePaste, he received a {{tl|uw-vandalism1}} warning at 05:14, 11 June 2008 [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:McSaucePaste&diff=prev&oldid=218595334], ignored the warning to vandalize Limbo at 16:24, 11 June 2008 [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Limbo_%28dance%29&diff=218717278&oldid=218650137] (which was his only article edit since receiving the warning), then was indefinitely blocked 14 hours later.  Are you really advocating that vandals be blocked after just a single level-one warning?  --
[Kralizec!]: Ok, I think I have a better understanding on Wknight94's perspective.  Thank you for taking the time and patience to help me \""step out of the box\"" on this.  As to Baseball Bugs's comment, not sure I can agree with this ... I too am from the midwest (lived in Ohio for most of the past 34 years), and I almost ''never'' block someone unless they have received a final warning (with exceptions for socks and vandals currently running rampant with mass edits).  --

[Kralizec!]: Also, I just noticed [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk%3A81.96.173.249&diff=240821394&oldid=240820872] that the admin .sig is no longer included inside the block template message box.  Is this an oversight or another \""feature\""?  --
[Kralizec!]: I guess I would use the phrase \""looks terrible\"" but \""awkward\"" works just as well.  While I would really like to support the {{tl|tmbox}}, forcing newer (working) templates like the uw-series into the change without first addressing all the issues gives me great pause.  It would be a different story if someone had said back in January 2007 \""hey, make sure these new uw templates follow [[Template:Tmbox\/styles]]\"" but 627 days later?  --

[Kralizec!]: Thank you for the explanation on my talk page [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKralizec%21&diff=243803058&oldid=243538233].  No need to apologize; just be more careful in the future when using a shared computer!  --
[Kralizec!]: Just wanted to let you know that I reverted your change [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Template:Schoolblock&diff=next&oldid=238824869] to {{tl|schoolblock}}.  Since this template is not transcluded, all 5835 instances of its use had their signature component broken by this change.  While I appreciate the boldness of your change, next time you might wish to discuss your proposed changes first at [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject user warnings]].  --
[Kralizec!]: Perhaps if it were part of the uw-series of template messages it would be substituted.  That, and the instructions on the template itself say \""do not subst this template as contact details may change in the future.\""  --
[Kralizec!]: Yeah, that has pretty much been my disposition about it too.  While it is annoying to have to remember to follow two different formats (one for the uw-series and a different one for schoolblock\/anonblock), I have never been annoyed ''enough'' to actually fix it.  --
[Kralizec!]: Hello.  One of your edits to the [[Neustrashimy class frigate]] article has me puzzled.  Unless it was an accident, I cannot for the life of me figure out why you removed half of the external links as well as the article's only template, all of its cats, and the interwiki links [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Neustrashimy_class_frigate&diff=prev&oldid=241574524].

[Kralizec!]: Hello.  While perusing AfD, I ran across your listing for [[Chicago Film Producers Alliance]].  However my take on the beginning part [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion\/Chicago_Film_Producers_Alliance&diff=next&oldid=261323904] is a little different.  {{user|ATurnerIII}} did not complain loudly; he instead asked nicely [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKralizec%21%2FArchive_2008&diff=260626986&oldid=260582528] to the first random member of {{cl|Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles}} he found - which happened to be me.  As per his request, I userfied it and left him instructions [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk%3AATurnerIII&diff=260778337&oldid=260713808] to \""improve the article so that it meets our [[WP:ORG|organizational notability standards]],\"" and then \""[[WP:MOVE|move]] it back into [[Wikipedia:Main namespace|article space]].\""  Had I known that he ignored my instructions and re-created essentially the exact same article the next day, I would have deleted it myself.  I am not sure what I should have done differently, but I am sorry that you have had to deal with this entire mess, and especially the editor's belligerent attitude.  I feel responsible, and would like to apologize to you.  --
[Kralizec!]: Hello.  Could you help me understand your reverts of the talk page contributions of {{user|81.132.107.66}}, especially as regarding to [[Talk:Drake Circus Shopping Centre]]?  Thank you,
[Kralizec!]: Thanks for taking care of the block notice for me!  That was #2 on my list after \""clean up mess.\""  --
[Kralizec!]: Also, you might want to double-check that I moved everything back to the right spots.  As my wife always points out, I am a notoriously bad speller, so I may not have been the best admin to fix all her moves.  --
[Kralizec!]: Thanks for the revert!  --
[Kralizec!]: Just curious, but why did you tag [[ARA Independencia]] as being an orphan?  It is a disambiguation page, rather than an article.  Thanks, \u2014
[Kralizec!]: Not being familiar with the subject of conversion disorder, it could take me some time to sift through everything and figure out if there is a pattern.  However if you -as a subject matter expert- could provide me with [[WP:DIFF|diffs]] showing how two different editors have made substantively the same edits, I could react ''much'' faster in protecting the project from disruption.  Thanks, \u2014
[Kralizec!]: Since the block on the original IP has expired, the current account is not engaging in block evasion.  Likewise none of the previous users were [[WP:BAN|banned]], so it is not ban evasion either.  As such, I cannot in good faith block the user.  I would suggest engaging the user to build a consensus version of the article, and if that does not work, use the standard [[WP:UTM|warning track]].  \u2014
[Kralizec!]: Unfortunately on the internet, anyone can pretend to be anything they want.  Wikipedia's only defense against that is our three core content policies: [[WP:NOR]], [[WP:VER]], and [[WP:NPOV]].  Rather than allow the editor to express his or her own -and potentially off the wall- opinions (a violation of [[WP:NOR]] and [[WP:NPOV]]), they must support any material that has been challenged (or likely to be challenged) with [[WP:CITE|citations]] to [[WP:RS|reliable, third-party, published]] sources (as per [[WP:VER]]).  \u2014
[Kralizec!]: The plot thickens.  The results of my preliminary investigation may be found at {{cl|Suspected Wikipedia sockpuppets of GayleNuffer}}.  Did I mention that I am in training as a SPI cleric ... ?   :-)  \u2014
[Kralizec!]: I doubt that a rangeblock would work in this case.  Leaving aside the massive potential for collateral damage, Gayle has asserted her opinions on this topic from two different ISPs as well as an AFB.  Should she press her juvenile threat, I suspect that [[WP:RBI]] paired like a fine wine with [[WP:DENY]] would be our best option.  In the meantime, I am going to go ahead and add the articles in question to my watchlist.  If you do the same, that should afford us some measure of protection.  \u2014
[Kralizec!]: He is right about [[Colonial Bancgroup]] being replaced by [[City National Bank (California)]] on the source.  I was very surprised to see that the FFIEC did a mid-quarter update of the list without changing the \""as of\"" date.  \u2014
[Kralizec!]: Hope this helps clear up any confusion that people may have experienced over this issue.  Assuming ''MBK004'' does not mind us using his talk page, you can feel free to respond here if you have any additional questions or concerns regarding this topic.  Thanks, \u2014
[Kralizec!]: With wikis, few things stay the same for long.  :-)  So ... if someone told you differently at some point in the past, the other person might well have been correct.  However it has only been within the past sixteen months that [[WP:BLANKING]] was explicitly updated to include anonymous editors.  Prior to that was anyone's guess.  And yes, lots of people have unknowingly flubbed this up over the years and inadvertently harassed IPs over their talk page warnings (me being one of the worst).  As penance for those earlier harassment sins, I now travel about and try to help people avoid making the same mistakes I did.  \u2014
[Kralizec!]: Hello.  As a recent editor to [[User talk:117.104.180.91]], I wanted to leave a friendly reminder that as per [[WP:USER]], editors may remove messages at will from their own talk pages.  While we may ''prefer'' that comments be archived instead, policy does not prohibit users -including anonymous editors like this one- from deleting messages or warnings from their own talk pages.  The only kinds of talk page messages that cannot be removed (as per [[WP:BLANKING]]) are declined unblock requests (but only while blocks are still in effect), confirmed sockpuppet notices, or shared IP header templates (for unregistered editors).  However, it should be noted that these exceptions only exist in order to keep a user from potentially gaming the system.  Thanks, \u2014
[Kralizec!]: Daleks are the supreme power, of the universe!  I obey [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_page_protection&action=historysubmit&diff=327169209&oldid=327165803 your command] and have semi-protected [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Little_Einsteins&action=historysubmit&diff=327174134&oldid=327164418] the [[Little Einsteins]] article.  \u2014
[Kralizec!]: Hello.  I was going to leave you a friendly reminder about [[WP:BLANKING]] in regards to your improper revert at [[User talk:24.79.238.203]], but I see that ''Xeno'' already did that a couple of months ago.  Would you care to explain what happened here?  Thanks,  \u2014
[Kralizec!]: No worries; I am glad to hear it was just a mixup with the tools.  As to your question, WP:BLANKING indicates that ''declined'' unblock requests should not be removed (and that is only to prevent abuse of the unblock system).  Thanks again, \u2014
[Kralizec!]: Sorry to hear about the results of the ArbCom election.  While I was terrified that MILHIST and SHIPS would be all the poorer if you were elected to ArbCom, I still voted for you anyway.  Better luck next time, mate!  :-)   \u2014

Hopefully this will give Gayle a chance to [[Conservapedia|find something better to do]] with his or her time.  \u2014

194.46.189.195,False,"[194.46.189.195]: Apologies if this is in the wrong place, but I noted the absence of a reference to the ancestry of four of the lead singers of CW as having been part of Anuna. I left a comment for you at the edit but must have done it wrong. Please accept an apology for my ignorance. The comment was \""Hi. I wouldn't call the info I inserted random trivia. The fact that four of the solo singers came from the ranks of Anuna is acknowledged in all of their official biographies and surely has a direct impact on their style of singing. It is surprising that this fact isn't already on the site\"". You undid the reference and listed it as random trivia. I think that it isn't, and that wouldn't simply be a matter of personal taste. Meav was part of Anuna for at least four years, Deirdre for at least three years, and Lynn for around four or five. I think Orla was part of that group for around a year. All four women list it on their CVs. Three of those women appear dotted as soloists all over the Anuna albums I have, and it is logical (and I suppose) correct, to assume that they were highly influenced by this group in their vocal approach to the music of Celtic Woman. It was, after all, Anuna that pioneered the \""high soprano\"" sound in the early 1990s through their work with Riverdance, and subsequently produced the soprano vocals of Eimear Quinn, winner of Eurovision Song Contest 1996. You might also note that most of the choral singers in the background are ex-Anuna I believe. I would point out that while you may think this is random trivia, Anuna appear to be still producing something unique enough for Celtic Woman to believe otherwise.

Shamir1,False,"[Shamir1]: TOM, you have got to be kidding me! Isabella of Castile played a very strong role setting up the Spanish Inquisition. She ordered Jews to be executed or expelled. Martin Luther was fiercely anti-Semitic. Please see [[Martin Luther and the Jews]] and [[On the Jews and Their Lies]].
[Shamir1]: Hi Tom, none of this is \""original research\"" it is ALL on WIKIPEDIA. it is not my opinion, these are all facts that are on this site. please look at each of the articles I showed you, including [[Isabella of Castile]]'s. thanks.
[Shamir1]: I was already briefing it up and tried to preview the page but I lost the server, then reloaded, then saw your comment and here we are. So now again, I'm on it. Thanks. --
[Shamir1]: What I got duped into believing? Then it might b a good idea to tell the producers ''[[60 Minutes]]'' who included it in an episode. Was this the first time you heard of it? I remember mainstream news here showing that clip on television, and a while ago a girlfriend of mine from France recalled the incident, so it was reported in Europe as well. And by the way, I am still thinking and editing back and forth on the Biden section. --
[Shamir1]: Also, the CNN source you added does not confirm the claim, and it is also before any actual investigation. If you actually look at each report, the Biden part (which is the only statement from a United States representative and only one that counters the UN team) is hardly longer than the rest. --
[Shamir1]: I added the thing to the camp because it is unsupported. I even had it translated to English and did not find those words anywhere. That is why we need a better citation, not because I \""think every Palestinian source is crap.\"" You gave the official camp site, yes, but where are those words? --
[Shamir1]: The main problem with the CNN source was not the \""initial\"" part, it was the fact that it does not even mention a massacre. \""Don't you get that?\"" Secondly, if you have a problem with the CNN report, tell it to them. Three, Americans got a kick out of it becuase they were NOT dying, just pretending they were. I have no idea where you got the idea that they were getting a kick out of them dying. Who was dying there? (And again, it was shown in Europe too.) I had to shorten the statement because it was too heavy without any source. I was not assuming bad faith, and thank you for providing me with those. I will have them translated. --
[Shamir1]: The CNN story reports the Palestinian claim which we already know is false. That's it. Nothing about fear or a massacre. I don't know why so many of the comments you say to may sound so appropriate when it comes to you, but hey, you've been here long enough to know that. --
[Shamir1]: Nor do I appreciate you mischaracterizing mine... Where did I say I reverted that edit because of vandalism? --
[Shamir1]: Please comment before making such a move. There is no problem with the source. No user has argued that Freedom House, which is used on several other Wikipedia pages, is not reputable source. Please read this carefully. I have taken the rules of Wikipedia into consideration. \""The need for citations is especially important when writing about opinions held on a particular issue. Avoid weasel words where possible, such as, \""Some people say ...\"" Instead, make your writing verifiable: find a specific person or group who holds that opinion and give a citation to a reputable publication in which they express that opinion. Remember that Wikipedia is not a place for expressing your own opinions or for original research.\"" The sentence (that was just reverted) followed all of such rules exactly. --
[Shamir1]: Why? Easy. Two big reasons: 1) The source is reputable and reliable. 2) I am following the [[WP:REF|rules]]. All the trouble just described is the result of users trying to wander around the very basic rules of Wikipedia. --
[Shamir1]: Israel is widely called such. This is one of the most prominent research institutes on democracy and freedom in the world. It is sufficient and an acceptable source for the intro. Having Freedom House say it is already a wide enough view. For months and months that sentence was there with the citation but without it saying that it is according to Freedom House. So now its come under attack, and I have added to say that it is the view of Freedom House (in addition to the citation already there). But even what I just said doesnt matter all that much. What matters is that we follow [[WP:REF]]. --
[Shamir1]: And I, and all Wikipedians, certainly CAN quote opinion pieces--and cite them as such.  The discussion of Hadash's politics is not found in the article. It would be a good idea to add it, which is why I felt it important to find a source. Really. One sentence from a piece that pretty much sums up the criticism against Hadash's alleged \""drift\"" is relevant and necessary. It should be correctly cited, and it is. --
[Shamir1]: Thanks for your edits to [[New Movement-Meretz]]. I have edited several Israeli political party articles and am familiar with all of them. I am wondering why you added so many references to the fact that Meretz is a left-wing party. Meretz indeed is a left-wing party, and it proudly identifies as such.

Arthur had been the heir presumptive, and Eleanor was his heir presumptive....
