[Arsenikk]: Hi. You may have missed it, but I had a follow-up question under the first point at [[Wikipedia:Featured list candidates\/List of Sacramento Regional Transit light rail stations\/archive1]]. <font face=\""serif\"">
[Arsenikk]: Hey! Did you finish fixing up everything at [[Talk:Hobart International Airport\/GA1]]? Nice if you could leave a note there when you're done so I know when to come back and looks things over. <font face=\""serif\"">
[Arsenikk]: Remember that at GA, an article does not need to be longer than what can be found in reliable sources; i.e. if there are no RS around from which to write the history, it cannot be required. On the other hand, news archives (at least online ones) can often provide some RS. For instance, in my recent GA [[V\xe6r\xf8y Airport]] (which was a strip with two daily services) I used a combination of an archaic book from the library about the airline for the pre-airport history, and a closed news search engine (which I only have access to because I'm a university student) to find news reports from back then. Most of the history actually dates from an \""convenient\"" accident report which would close the article. These are some possible RS; there may be others, or there may be very little. In a way, it is often up to the discretion of the author of smaller articles to determine when there is no more to say. <font face=\""serif\"">
[Arsenikk]: Hi. I notice you have spent the morning [at least in my timezone] moving masses of articles, such [[Greece\u2013Norway relations]] to [[Greece \u2013 Norway relations]]. Why? The [[WP:MOS|Manual of Style]] is very clear on this issue: \""Disjunctive en dashes are unspaced, except when there is a space within either one or both of the items ({{xt|the New York&nbsp;\u2013 Sydney flight}}; {{xt|the New Zealand&nbsp;\u2013 South Africa grand final}}; {{xt|June 3, 1888&nbsp;\u2013 August 18, 1940}}, but {{xt|June\u2013August 1940}}).\"" As for instance both 'Norway' and 'Greece' consist of a single world, there is no room for interpretation and the articles should have remaind where they were. I have also failed to find any kind of discussion about the issue before you went around with such a massive move. <font face=\""serif\"">
[Arsenikk]: The MOS says that by default en dashes [in this use] are not spaced. However, if one of the two \""items\"" has two or more words, then the en dash is spaced. For instance, [[Norway \u2013 United States relations]] is correctly spaced, because 'United States' consists of two or more worlds. On the other hand [[Norway\u2013Sweden relations]] is not to have such a space, because both 'Norway' and 'Sweden' only consist of a single word. I would strongly recommend you move back all the moves where both countries are single-worded, and in the future please make sure you understand the naming conventions and Manual of Style before doing massive moves to articles. <font face=\""serif\"">
[Arsenikk]: I notice you reverted [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Vehicle&action=historysubmit&diff=403523377&oldid=403460215 my edits] of [[vehicle]], stating \""restore lost references\"". This is an counterproductive revert. The article is in dire need of a clean-up, for which my edit was a small step. It is hard to me to believe you even looked at my edit, which contains removal of inappropriate legal definitions in a single province (which had a different scope than the article), merging of several small and trivial sections, copyediting, removal of out-of-scope content, formatting, and removal of out-of-scope external links. The one reference that was removed, was done so of a good reason, because a legal definition from that province directly contradicts the definition of a vehicle on Wikipedia. Please be more careful with reverts in the future. Just because references are being removed, does not mean the edits are disruptive. Thank you for your understanding, <font face=\""serif\"">
[Arsenikk]: Hi. I've been asked to create articles on [[K-point]] and [[hill size]] at FLC. Perhaps you could help me by translating the terms in [[:File:Hoppbakke-skjema.svg]].

[Arsenikk]: To follow up on the non-article comments from the Kristins Hall review: I have been doing some work with the [[1994 Winter Olympics]]; the article needs a decent copyedit (I just have to get around to it) and it should slide through GA. At the moment the article has some shortcomings that I am very aware of, and currently there is little use in anyone else fixing much to it. Once past GA, I'll need some help to get it up to FA standards, if you are interested in collaborating about that. I've brought or nominated seven 1994 venues for GA, in addition to having brought [[venues of the 1994 Winter Olympics]] to FL. On slightly more long term plans, I might do the same with the 1952 Games. I tend to switch a bit around topics, right now I'm doing some stuff on football, so I don't know when I'll be back to Olympics articles. <font face=\""serif\"">
[Arsenikk]: Is there anything more to say about [[Superfinalen]]? I was thinking of GA nominating it, but it seems a bit short. On the other hand, I don't know what else to write about it. <font face=\""serif\"">

[Arsenikk]: Details about the ski jump are at [[Holmenkollbakken]] (fully referenced). I find the Olympics article a bit unclear in that the hill had been rebuilt many times between 1892 and 1952, see for instance the difference between [[:File:Holmenkollbakken 1904.jpg|1904]] and [[:File:Holmenkollbakken 1934.jpg|1934]] (both images). In the 1952 article, it gives the impression that the hill had remained constant since 1892, which is not the case. The bit about the wooden superstructure being replaced with concrete is accurate, though, as this was done for the Olympics. <font face=\""serif\"">

[Arsenikk]: Hey! I'm on my last week of vacation now. hopefully back home on Saturday, and then I'll have more time for this stuff. I've sort of been working on the article, but I haven't saved it online. The list needs some explanatory text and a few other things and after that it will need a copyedit.

{unknown-5016},False,"[{unknown-5016}]: {{od|::::::::::::::}}I'm not too sure. One of the things I do is standardisation of templates and their documentation, like [[Template:Current daylight saving offset documentation]] and [[Template:File deletion template notice]], which hold common documentation for several templates. If you find more templates where [[Template:File deletion template notice]] can be used, you can transclude it onto the relevant documentation subpages. There are examples under \""''see also''\"" at [[Template:File deletion template notice]]. Something slightly easier you could do is look out for templates with documentation that isn't on a subpage. You can then move the documentation to the subpage. An example of this can be seen at [[Template:SD warn-needed]] and [[Template:SD warn-needed\/doc]] where I moved the documentation from the former to the latter. On another note, I noticed that your edit [[Template:Uw-refimprove\/doc|here]] caused a template loop! {{=)|surprise}} However, it wasn't quite your fault. The Singlenotice template is used instead of the documentation so the documentation subpage is redundant. Good luck! {{=)}} '''<span style=\""font-family:garamond;white-space:nowrap;\"">"

[Matt Yeager]: I don't really want to do this, but I'm wondering if you would please reconsider. The \""[[e (number)|e]]\"" issue occured about three months ago. That's what I meant when I said that \""I learned a lot\"" from it; I did learn an awful lot about [[WP:CIVIL]], etc. . I know I DID make mistakes on the page in multiple facets, but I'm wondering if you could point out any time where I really \""lost my head\"". I don't personally believe that I ever acted ''too far'' out of line; I'd really appreciate knowing where I went so wrong (if in fact I did), since once a source emerged for the claim, I did back off. I haven't asked any of the other \""oppose\"" voters to reconsider (though I might), but you seemed to have a very positive opinion of my adminship potential, except for one (admittedly bad) mistake I made. I really do believe that I've learned from that mistake, and hope that you reconsider (though of course I understand why you wouldn't).
[Matt Yeager]: That's one example. I don't have all that many others, because I don't do the \""talk page of contentious article\"" thing so much anymore. That's why, actually, my little musical note redirects to [[Special:Random]]... because that's how I've made so many of my worthwhile edits (like the ones to [[Chris Vance]], [[Dedan Kimathi]], etc... some totally random dudes that I just stumbled across in a state of total disrepair). I've tried to put the encylcopedia first, especially since the '''e''' debacle... I've come to realize that there are vastly more important (and vastly more easily changed) things than one sentence on a certain number's importance. Really, that's the most important thing I've learned from the arguments I've had on Wikipedia, and I hope that the scope of my edits proves how thoroughly I've taken it to heart. If the reasons I've presented seem compelling enough, then I would like to ask you to please change your vote on my RFA. Thanks for listening in any case.
[Matt Yeager]: Thanks! :) I hope you're feeling better, too. Happy editing!
[Matt Yeager]: [[Image:Explosions.jpg|thumb|left|165px|My admin request went up in flames.

I don't know if or when I'll go up for nomination again, but even if I don't, I will try not to betray the trust that you and 36 others were willing to place in me. Thanks for having faith in me. Happy editing... and thanks again!
[Matt Yeager]: Pi forever! =P
[Matt Yeager]: All things considered, I'd rather not request deletion. Redirects are cheap, and if anyone wants the make a funky template, they can give it another name. I can't imagine what would be properly named [[Template:Funky]], can you? So, if you don't mind too awful much, I'd really just rather have it be a redirect. You can always nominate it yourself at RFD if it's that big of a deal to you, but I don't think that I'm going to myself. Cheers,
[Matt Yeager]: Actually, scratch that... I just re-created the \""funky\"" template, because I want to have the word \""please\"" in there--just to be politeand all--and other editors are against that. So, I won't bug them about {{tl|for}}, and will just keep {{tl|funky}} for the \""please\"" version. What's wrong with almost-redundant templates, after all? (Or is there something wrong with them--I honestly don't know for sure!) Anyways, hope that this isn't unacceptable to you.
[Matt Yeager]: Congratulations, again. Good for you, and good for the encyclopedia. Block some vandals for me!

[Matt Yeager]: Wow, you actually beat me; you supported the RFA before I even notified you on your talkpage. You're really way too good at this whole Wikipedia thing. ;)
[Matt Yeager]: Hey, I was wondering why you moved the Richland High article. It's a bad idea to have parenthenses in the name of any article unless they're needed for disambiguation, but there don't seem to be any other Richland High's. Are you about to make a disambiguation page with some names, or did I miss something?
[Matt Yeager]: Oh, I'm not faulting you at all... I'm just worried that we're only just starting to air out our arguments, and suddenly there's this 5-days-left time bomb. And I know it's just an informal survey to see where everyone stands, but I'm concerned we might have people on either side say \""Oh, my side won 8-6, we're totally moving it to Matchbox Twenty (or keeping it at matchbox twenty)\"". But I appreciate the idea, I'd just personally have wanted a bit of a longer wait. In a few days, we may well have all the arguments clearly laid out, and then I'll feel comfortable make a \""vote\"". Cheers!
[Matt Yeager]: Which was certainly well within your rights to do.
[Matt Yeager]: When the chords in the chorus are D flat, A flat, B flat minor, and G flat, the chorus quite simply is either in non-Ionian mode or it's just in D flat. I'm certainly not going to revert you, of course. But what you should know is that the chorus is in D flat, whether the sheet music marks the key change by changing the signature or just puts in a bunch of accidentals.
[Matt Yeager]: Sure. The name \""Research Park\"" was untaken and it's essentially the only name I've ever heard for that area.

[discospinster]: As for the corporate logo, the guidelines can be found at [[WP:LOGOS]].  Generally the use of the corporate logo on the Wikipedia page for that corporation would be considered \""fair use\"" under U.S. copyright law, because it's used to illustrate the company.  It must be low resolution so that it would not be useful for any other purpose (i.e. so someone won't want to take it and use it elsewhere).  You wouldn't have to ask permission of the company to do this.  However, when you upload it you have to explain precisely how the use of the image in the article is \""fair use\"".  An example of such an explanation is the [[Apple Inc.]] logo [[:File:Apple-logo.png]].  If you need help with it let me know.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: In order to indicate the significance of a subject, the article must state how the company is notable.  Wikipedia has a certain definition of \""notability\""; the general guidelines can be found at [[WP:N]] and the specific guidelines for companies are at [[WP:CORP]].  You would need to show that the company has received significant coverage in [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] that are [[WP:IND|independent]] of the subject (e.g. newspaper articles or editorial reviews in well-known consumer web pages).  If you'd like to start a draft of an article to work on, you could do it in your userspace, at [[User:Jaydeeself\/My Infant Needs Inc]].  I've moved the original article there.  You should also read the page [[WP:Your first article]]; it will give you some tips on how to write the article.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: I was using templates to format the references.  There is a list of them at [[WP:CT]].  It doesn't matter which order you put in the fields, the template will always format them in a specific order.  I used {{tlx|cite news}} for both, so I'm not sure why they came out slightly different.  For the purpose of the template, Reuters is not considered an author but a news agency, so it would go in the field <code>|agency=<\/code> rather than <code>|author=<\/code>.  Apparently this makes a difference.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>

I see that you left a message for [[User:Urbanrenewal]], and [[User:Sphilbrick]] has also asked for clarification, so hopefully there will be some more information one way or the other.  From a quick look at the original SP investigation I'm not seeing anything that would implicate you, so I don't think you have to worry too much.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: If you are referring to [[Health Fidelity]], it's not currently flagged for deletion.  The previous version was deleted because it did not indicate how the company is notable per [[WP:CORP]].  The current version has a lot of references, but few of them are actually about the company itself.  You need to find and add [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] that directly talk about the company.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: There's nothing in the article that indicates he is well-known.  You need to add [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] that show he meets [[WP:BIO]].  On the [[Talk:John J. Powers (actor, comedian)|article's talk page]] you bring up significant roles in TV or films, a large fan base, and unique contributions in entertainment, but there's no specifics as to what they are.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: Seven days.  An alternative is to move it to your article space (say, at [[User:Jkinzler777\/John J. Powers (actor, comedian)]]) where you can work on it as a [[WP:DRAFT]] until it's ready to go back into article space.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: I've moved it for you since I'm not sure if you're autoconfirmed yet.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: Because you did not supply a source?  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: Yeah, I wasn't sure because the books were written by authors with WP articles, and the notability guidelines for lists tend to be somewhat more relaxed.  But if a broader consensus would help, then I agree it should go to AfD.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: I would suggest that you work on the article in your name space; that way it's not likely to be deleted.  For example, you could start an article [[WP:DRAFT|draft]] at [[User:Nutty48\/The White Cross (Gaming Clan)]], and ask other editors for their opinion at [[WP:FEEDBACK]].  I hope this helps.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: Hi Dan.  I can't delete the image myself, since it's in Wikimedia Commons and I don't have privileges there.  Eventually someone that can delete it will come by and do so.  I'll try nominating it again and we'll see if it makes any difference.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: I think what happened was you (I assume it was you) placed the deletion tag on the page, but since you were editing as an IP and not logged in, you weren't able to create the deletion request page.  The request was thus not technically complete.  I've created the deletion request page so it should proceed normally from there.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: Hi there.  Since you are the only author of the [[Geraldine Jones]] page, you don't have to do anything fancy to merge it.  Just copy the text from the article and paste it in an appropriate place in [[The Flip Wilson Show]] article with an edit summary like ''merging info from <nowiki>[[Geraldine Jones]]<\/nowiki>''.  Then replace the text of the Geraldine Jones article with <code><nowiki>#REDIRECT [[The Flip Wilson Show]]<\/nowiki><\/code>, put in an edit summary like ''info merged; redirecting'' and save it.  Let me know if you have any troubles with it.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: Preferably it would have its own article, but there should at least be a link to a [[WP:RS|reliable source]] discussing the micronation (like a newspaper article, but not the micronation's own web page).  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: I'm not 100% sure myself, but I saw that there are other articles on French schools similarly named ([[List of schools in France]]).  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: Since [[WP:CSD#A7]] does not define \""important\"" or \""significant\"" it is difficult for me to respond to an editor who asks me what it means, since I don't know (other than \""lower standard than notability\"").  Until I can get an idea of what it's referring to I might as well use the term \""notability\"" for articles that are certain to be deleted, since it's the only term that is given any explanation.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: Since it's a contentious issue, I don't want to summarily delete the article.  However, since I can't find any verification either, I've [[WP:PROD|proposed]] that it be deleted.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: It's no trouble; I'm glad you brought it up because I do think there needs to be some kind of guideline as to what \""important or significant\"" means.  It's very vague, so I don't think that helps potential editors either.  I didn't realize it was such an issue for admin candidates.  I probably should spend some time at RFA. :-)  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: It should have been deleted by now.  There might still be something wrong with the nomination, so I've reverted all that and started again.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: I don't think it's ready quite yet.  The language comes across as unencyclopedic and promotional (e.g. ''His comedy is infectious -- you will find it nearly impossible to stop laughing!!'').  Some of the text is copied directly from the PRweb article, which is a violation of copyright.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: Sorry about overwriting the changes you had made.  I had to move the history over but I figured you would go back and make the corrections again. :-)  As for the typo redirect, I have deleted it as an unlikely redirect.  Thanks for letting me know.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: The link from PRWeb is not independent, as it is a press release.  Gig Masters and the New York Hysterical Society are also not independent since he works for them.  The Comedy Point and Funny or Die links only demonstrate that he contributes to those sites, not that he meets one of the points on the list above.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: While all of the above might be true, there needs to be more [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] in the article verifying it.  I did a search for \""Girlsounds\"" and I couldn't really find anything that discussed it as a musical style.  As for the references in the article, two of them just indicate that the records exist, and the other one is unclear (is it a book?).  The maintenance tags are there so that other editors will notice and maybe have a go at adding references and cleaning up the article.  I'm sorry that you feel \""demeaned and abused\"" but this is very much the process that new articles go through, as they are always \""under construction\"".  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: If he did play for Chelsea, then there would be some argument for notability.  But there is nothing that verifies it.  People often try to create articles that are untrue (many times relating to football; I have deleted more than a few of those), and one way to check is to search for references.  If none can be found then it will likely be labelled a hoax.  I will restore it and change the deletion reason.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: You need to be more cynical. :)  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: The [[WP:PAGE|history]] of the article does matter because it shows who has edited it.  If an article is the wrong name, or another name would be better, it could be [[WP:MOVE|moved]] to the new name, which moves all of the history with it.  It is not correct procedure to redirect an existing article just because the name has to change.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: Oh I see.  I knew something was dodgy but I don't have enough experience with Commons to figure it out.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: Hi Douglas.  Please see [[Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials]] for instructions on how to allow the material to be used on Wikipedia (via the terms of the [[WP:CC-BY-SA|CC-BY-SA]] and [[GFDL]]).  Basically you would need to grant Wikipedia permission the text under the CC-BY-SA license, which means that anyone else would be able to use it as long as they attribute Wikipedia and offer it under the same license.  Often it's better to re-write the content in your own words, so that the tone is more [[WP:NPOV|neutral]] and less [[WP:PEACOCK|promotional]]. <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: To become an autoconfirmed user (the minimum for uploading images) you have to have made at least 10 edits to articles.  But I've gone ahead and made you a confirmed user, so you should be able to do it now.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: Hi there.  First of all there is an issue with the article name -- if it's about the Sallie Mae funding change, why should the article be named after one of the schools affected?  It also needs to be written in a more [[WP:NPOV|neutral]] tone, just stating facts and not coming down on one side or the other.  There's not really a need to list the individual schools that closed.  Also, sources should also be [[WP:RS|reliable]], like newspaper articles, and not blogs or discussion forums.  For example, the [[Tech Republic]] and [[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] articles would be reliable sources, but the sallie-mae-warning.blogspot site and \""Sallie Mae - My Story\"" would not be.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>
[discospinster]: Yeah, I'm not really sure what I've got myself into.  <font color=\""DarkGray\"">...<\/font>"

Nelbev,False,"[Nelbev]: It sounds like you've taken quite the break, but I'm wondering if you can help me fix something that I believe is in dire need of fixing. This is a huge problem for the way economic theory is treated in wikipedia. The definitions of [[socialism]] and [[capitalism]] that are used in wikipedia neither reflect the usage of the terms within the school of economics nor do they accurately describe the countries that are generally considered to be, or define themselves to be, [[socialist]] or [[capitalist]]. Worse yet, the definitions of the terms reflect the usage of the terms by a specific segment of the US population. That is, [[socialism]] is meant to be synonymous with a command economy, or a [[planned economy]], according to the misuse of the terms in wikipedia. And [[capitalism]] is meant to be synonymous with [[laissez-faire]] according to the misuse. For example, the US could not be considered to be capitalist by wikipedia standards, yet is is one of the most market-oriented modern democracies in the existence. In fact, by wikipedia standards, no country could be considered to be capitalist! I have both undergraduate and graduate texts that clarify the misuse of these terms, however a segment of the US population has made it especially difficult to change much of these definitions. This takes away from the more economic approach of defining a free market economy, mixed economy, and command economy as the economies with differing levels of central planning. I know that neither political economy nor economic history is your field, but I was hoping you could give me some advice as to how to properly fix these essential components of the wikipedia project. As is, the economic concepts that the general public uses most often are horribly misused and incorrectly defined in wikipedia. Can you lend some guidance as to how to fix this problem?"

Funny how there seems to have already been a Frost page, but that it was deleted. See here[http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=List_of_climbers&action=historysubmit&diff=298290868&oldid=298290716]. I wonder why it was scrapped? Great article of yours anyway. Regards,
[Ericoides]: Ah, I see. Thanks for the info. No probs re the edit.
[Ericoides]: Hmm, interesting question. I'm really not sure. It would be good to have a date before it appears on the home page as a DYK. Why not have a go; there wouldn't be a way to reference it tho', but I don't see the harm in that. I can't find a date online, but I haven't looked too hard. From one of the pages linked in your article we know for a fact that he is over 60... (Added later: From this interview[http:\/\/www.climbing.com\/community\/perspective\/tom_frost_the_full_perspective_interview\/index.html] we know he is at least 72, but I'm not sure when the interview took place. Even if I did, the year might be one of two, as it were) But at present the article is like a statue missing a head.
[Ericoides]: If I might make one more remark, good idea for scrapping the infobox. I can't see the point of them for this kind of article. Cheers,
[Ericoides]: Ah. If you look at the infobox in the [[Allen Steck]] article it should be clear. Simply add info to the fields for which you have info. Details here: [[MOS:INFOBOX]]. If Frost does repond, you could be cheeky and ask if he has a photo of himself which he'd be happy for us to use.... Regards,
[Ericoides]: Good work on TF; how nice to hear of someone so reclusive and publicity-shy. Thanks for the [[Mount Garmo|Garmo]] input too.
[Ericoides]: Thanks for your cleanup but now the ''Daily Mail'' reference I added today simply gives \"" .London\"" without the name of the paper in the ref, which cannot be correct. I'd amend it myself but I can't work out how to... Regards,
[Ericoides]: Ta.
[Ericoides]: If I can just chuck in my tuppence worth, you DO need to put the four tildes in your comment above. Happy Xmas!
[Ericoides]: A lifetime working in London's publishing houses and I've never heard that one before (\""British English tends not to use full stops after initials etc\"" \u2013 it seems particularly odd that you should maintain this, having started an article entitled F. G. L. Chester!). In the book world we place a period after letters if the abbreviation fails to end with the final letter of that which is being abbreviated. Hence we put a period after Rev. but not after Revd ... Unless the Hon. E. E. Villiers was actually an Hon (not an Honourable), and unless her two names were E and E (rather than Elizabeth, Emily or what-have-you), we would always style her the Hon. E. E. Villiers. If going with your style I would suggest it might be better to close up the Es so she is EE Villiers (I've done this in the piece). Even then, she should certainly be the Hon. (with, if you'll excuse the expression, a period). I consulted [[Abbreviation#Periods_.28full_stops.29_and_spaces]] and it seems to be fairly accurate, except that it uses newspapers in its examples (FT etc.). When I have time I'll expand it to cover other forms of publishing. I have the feeling that an encyclopedia should be using books rather that newspapers as its stylistic inspiration, would you not agree? Kind regards,
[Ericoides]: Ah, the onscreen experience was not something I had considered, so thanks for pointing that out. You might be right. There is, however, something about T. S. Eliot or E. P. Thompson that seems much (for want of a better word) 'classier' than TS Eliot or EP Thompson, perhaps just the old buffer in me seeing the inexorable creep of txtspk into areas where it has no business being. I can't say I care for the Guardian's style too much (don't mention their spelling), and they do seem to try to be wilfully different for the sake of it (double-quotes, no italics for book titles etc.). 'Periods' I use as it's marginally shorter than full stop, but to be precise I should have written 'full-point'.
[Ericoides]: This is all very interesting, bringing up lots of things I'd never considered (eg the screen issue), so thanks for that. I've often wondered why people used that &nb thingy rather than a straightforward en-rule (as here \u2013). Re your point concerning 'this is the way British usage is generally moving', I genuinely think that it moves because people in positions of publishing power \u2013 eg editors \u2013 let it do so, and so it behoves us \u2013 as editors \u2013 to make sure it goes where we want it to go. We are not entirely passive (this is very much the case in book publishing, where if I want something to be styled in such-and-such a way I can ensure it is, thereby creating or perpetuating a style that others might cite as a norm). OK, back to work, nice to chat.
[Ericoides]: Equally, 'furthest' is quite acceptable in [[Lenzspitze]] and all the other UK-related pages or pages where UK spelling was used from the outset that you have changed. Given the two comments above, please check UK usage and be careful re these changes to so many articles, it's a lot of work to tidy up (Cassell English Dict. \""furthest\"" a. most remote in time or place; Oxford Concise Dict. \""furthest\"" a & adv (used as superl. of FAR) 1. a. Most distant; etc). Regards,
[Ericoides]: Thanks for your message. What you say might be true for US English \u2013 indeed it's an interesting and useful distinction; sadly that is not the issue here. Re your comment about the restricted use of further\/furthest as \""Further means \""more far\/distant\"" figuratively or non-physically\"", in UK English you'll notice that the OED and the Cassell dictionary disagree with you (\""most remote in time or place\"" and \""Most distant\"" (OED gives for \""further\"" To or at more advanced point in space or time \u2013 from this one can infer that space is certainly relevant to furthest). Please give me a reference from a dictionary of UK English that supports your point. Until then please do not keep changing articles in UK English to what you mistakenly believe to be correct usage. Kind regards,
[Ericoides]: Your work on spelling is truly amazing, but may I ask you again to respect UK spelling. In [[Chessington World of Adventures]] you changed speciality to specialty. In UK English (which should be used here, as the park is in the UK) speciality is the correct word. Perhaps you might internalise [[American_and_British_English_spelling_differences|this list]] (speciality is even listed there as the correct UK spelling) and any further lists that give more examples!
[Ericoides]: Thanks for your last message!

[Ericoides]: So [[Tajik Air]] did not kill you?
[Ericoides]: Hi Wereon, thanks for your message. You say that \""it does officially have a comma\"", but looking at an official source such as www.parliament.co.uk (ie Hansard) I find that you seem to be mistaken. See these refs[http:\/\/www.parliament.uk\/search\/results\/?q=Sheffield+Hallam] [http:\/\/www.parliament.uk\/search\/results\/?q=Plymouth+Sutton+and+Devonport]. Equally, are you saying that in calling the constituency Sheffield Hallam that the Sheffield City Council is incorrect? See [http:\/\/www.sheffield.gov.uk\/your-city-council\/elections\/election-results\/general-election-2010]. These sources seem to be as official as you can get. Moreover, I am intrigued why you haven't changed the name of the [[Plymouth Sutton and Devonport]] article itself. Regards,
[Ericoides]: Thanks for that. It looks like a lot of pages need their names changing then! (Just noticed you are at Cuths. Small world; so was I (1982\u201385)).
[Ericoides]: Hi Sk\xe4pper\xf6d, Thanks for your message. It's nice that we were both correct and incorrect. Best wishes,
[Ericoides]: Hello, Just wondering if there is an ODNB entry for this character. I've still a lot to add from my alpine books (when I can locate them, they're in boxes from a recent move). (The fr wiki has material on him but it's not properly cited so I'm waiting till I find my books.) Regards,
[Ericoides]: Hi Jim, Just wondering whether you might have any info on [[James Eccles]], about whom I've just started a page. He seems to have done a fair bit in the Rockies. I don't have any books on US mountaineering, whilst I imagine that you have quite a few. Any new info gratefully received. Best wishes,
[Ericoides]: Many thanks for that wealth of info, invaluable. I'll try and fit it into the article. Regards,
[Ericoides]: Re Eckenstein, I think there's something in a Winthrop Young biography I have, as well as a Younghusband biog. Plus a passage in Eric Newby's ''A Short Walk in the Hindu Kush'' (about the Eckenstein boulder in Snowdonia). I'll have a rummage tomorrow, it's late now. Crowley biogs have more, of course.
[Ericoides]: Many of my books are still in storage but I found this (btw, JP means [[justice of the peace]]). \""Early in 1907 Geoffrey was voted on the committee of the [[Climbers' Club]], the club for Snowdonia climbers, and immediately he was in action. His Journal notes: \""Made a brilliant (!) speech at their dinner, with [[Sir Charles Trevelyan, 3rd Baronet|Charles Trevelyan]] and [[Francis Acland]] as my guests, who also spoke. Helped to settle the Eckenstein-Abraham row over the Abrahams' North Wales book.\"" Oscar Eckenstein was an impressive but odd man, one of the very few who could get along with \""the great beast\"", Aleister Crowley. A railway engineer by profession, he was a veteran climber with an original and inventive mind, a pioneer of balance climbing and a pioneer, too, of the use of crampons on snow and ice. Like many of the Snowdonia climbers, he hated publicity, believing that their sport should remain private and exclusive. The [[George and Ashley Abraham|Abraham brothers]] of [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]], George and Ashley, had grown up in a very different tradition. They were professional photographers and took the view of their [[Lake District]] mentor, [[O. G. Jones]], that climbing was such fun that everybody should be told about it and encouraged to have a go. In 1906 the brothers published a book, ''Rock Climbing in North Wales'', crammed with accounts of adventures on the cliffs of Snowdonia and illustrated by their superb photographs. This would have been enough to upset Eckenstein but, compounding the offence, one passage in the book, [94] about an early attempt on the [[Y Garn (Glyderau)|Devil's Kitchen]], vividly described his assault on the crux wall and \""pricipitate retreat\"". An incensed Eckenstein introduced a resolution at the Club's annual meeting, the exact terms of which have not been recorded. The tenor, however, is obvious. Ashley Abraham stood up to plead that he and his brother had intended no personal offence. Eckenstein was finally persuaded to withdraw his resolution.\"" Hankinson, Alan (1995). ''Geoffrey Winthrop Young: Poet, Educator, Mountaineer'', Hodder & Stoughton, 1995, pp. 93\u20134. In a later passage in the same book, Eleanor Slingsby (daughter of [[William Cecil Slingsby|Cecil Slingsby]]), gives this brief portrait of OE. \""I remember Eckenstein very well at the 1911 party, hammering things in the hall and smoking his awful pipe tobacco. He had a bushy beard at that time and was regarded as something of a prophet figure.\"" (p. 119) On p. 233 Hankinson notes that OE, together with [[John Percy Farrar|Farrar]] and [[Norman Collie|Collie]], had helped GWY with his book ''Mountain Craft''. If you have the time\/energy you could also trawl through some of [http:\/\/www.ukclimbing.com\/forums\/info\/search.php?forum=0&dates=1&name=&topic=&body=Eckenstein these threads] on UKC (eg the one entitled \""Who was the Brit mountaineer?\"").
[Ericoides]: Your work on OE is excellent, well done. If you have the time you could give more details on the OE-Abraham feud (the GWY above) after the sentence \""though their relationship was not always smooth\"". For instance, \""though their relationship was not always smooth, as may be in seen in the Eckenstein-Abraham row. This was caused by the publication of the Abrahams' North Wales guide in which Eckenstein was ... etc etc.\""; always nice to have specifics. This would then lead nicely into the North Wales material that follows. I'm afraid I don't know much about that period of the AC, although I know Whymper had trouble with the AC because he was considered a \""swell\"" (a [[Class (social)|class]] distinction, I think). There is an excellent collection of essays called ''Mirrors in the Cliffs'' (ed Perrin) which, among many other good things, describes this period; many decades later, as the [[Edward Lisle Strutt]] article says, \""... 1927\u201337, these being the years \u2013 according to Alan Hankinson \u2013 in which 'the Alpine Club [...] had declined into a stuffy, snobbish, backward-looking institution. Its dominant figure was Colonel E. L. Strutt [...] for many years the autocratic and outspoken editor of the Alpine Journal. His views were rigid and intolerant. The only decent and honourable way to climb was the way in which he had climbed as a young man. Crampons were inadmissible; pitons anathema.\""
[Ericoides]: Yes, you might be right. Perhaps he asked for a [[U and non-U English|serviette]] rather than a napkin. Most of what I know about California comes either from the Grateful Dead or ''Curb Your Enthusiasm''. The only time I visited I was 6 years old.
[Ericoides]: I'm guessing you ''must'' be in [[Dushanbe]].
[Ericoides]: Thanks Hro\xf0ulf. Gresham's eh, what a coincidence!
[Ericoides]: I'm not sure if this has already been raised at DYK in the past few days as I haven't visited it but I've put on a query on the article's [[Talk:Robert_Parker_Les_sept_p\xeach\xe9s_capiteux|talk page]]. Nice article, btw.
[Ericoides]: I've changed it now to ''Robert Parker: Les Sept P\xeach\xe9s capiteux'' so it corresponds completely with the book's cover. (It always seems to me that French use of upper-case in titles is rather haphazard, but the cover should always be followed ...)
[Ericoides]: Unless I'm misunderstanding you, have a look at the title as presented on the book's cover. Two fonts (hence, partly, colon). Then, in that extravagant script (the subtitle (hence again, partly, colon)), upper-case L, S and P and lower-case c (i.e. ''Les Sept P\xeach\xe9s capiteux''). That, aside from the imprint page, is the best authority we have for the correct spelling of the title.
[Ericoides]: Lovely article, congratulations.
[Ericoides]: Lovely article, congratulations.
[Ericoides]: No problem. I used to live in Sofia in the early 1970s (on Marshal Tolbukhin, if you know it) and your articles bring back some very happy memories.

[Ericoides]: Nice article.
[Ericoides]: As you were the creator of these pages I thought I should say that I've moved [[British Mount Everest Expedition 1922]] to [[1922 British Mount Everest Expedition]] and likewise with the 1924 one so that, eg, [[Portal:Mountains\/Alpine_history]] has a consistent list, with event following date (eg [[2008 K2 disaster]]). Unlike my misguided Base Camp suggestion above, I think this one works and I hope it's OK with you. Regards,
[Ericoides]: Hi Lihaas, I'm not sure what you are trying to say with this phrase: \""as well as a revolt from southern secessionists (where Osama Bin Laden is originally from[7])\"". How can he be \""from\"" southern secessionists? People are \""from\"" places. I am \""from\"" England, and he is \""from\"" Riyadh. If you are trying to say something different (I'm guessing you want to say that ObL's [[Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden|father]] is Yemeni, which is not the same as saying that ObL is from Yemen), please say so clearly and in English, rather than reverting perfectly reasonable changes. Thanks,
[Ericoides]: Fair enough. It was not stated clearly, that's all.
[Ericoides]: How you've rephrased it is perfect :).
[Ericoides]: I am not really sure what I think. I drafted this: Weak support for rename to Category:People educated at X. This is the clearest method. It's a great shame to ditch the idiosyncratic and charming Old Wykehamist etc, but I do like a bit of internal consistency in my categories (eg, see [[:Category:Deaths in sport]] for an awful mess). Makes them easier to work with. 'Alumni' for 'school pupils' is quite horrid and should be avoided at all costs. (Some hours later, I was disturbed to find [http:\/\/wyksoc.com\/ this].) Thanks for notifying me, tho'.
[Ericoides]: Hi Larry. Sorry, my point about the \""ridiculous title\"" referred to that unwieldly and very American construction, \""William R. Kenan, Jr., Professor of Sociology\"" at the University of Virginia. I should have been more clear. We surely don't need to say \""University Professor\"" (should be lower-case, in any case), as that is implied by the Wazza R. Kenan stuff. As an aside, I remember ''Prophesy and Progress'' very well as an undergraduate in the early 1980s, and I still have two copies, one my own, the other the library's that I carelessly forgot to return. Regards,
[Ericoides]: Ah. In which case you are right. Another US-ism, so I'll revise what I said above, and say that \""ridiculous\"" now covers both designations. I'll leave it to you whether or not it's reinstated, but personally I'd leave it out. It's no great potatoes either way.
[Ericoides]: Hi Jim, axes aside, I've just seen your comment on [[Talk:Thomas Graham Brown]]. Yes, you are correct. I've just acquired a copy of ''Brenva'' so I'll be greatly expanding the article in the next few weeks. But see my rather weary comment on the Talk page. Regards,
[Ericoides]: I've made a few minor changes to Wright, mostly closing up the refs to the text immediately preceding them. Bit busy at the moment with work but will have a better look on Wednesday. Looking good, though.
[Ericoides]: The blog that quotes the paper is not a reliable source, so we cannot trust what it claims the ''Sunday Times'' says.
[Ericoides]: Hi Epeefleche, Just wondering \u2013 if you've any spare time \u2013 if you'd have a look at [[Ntrepid]] to see whether anything can be added etc. I'd like to take it to DYK but it's a bit on the short side; there's not much info on this shadowy organisation. Thanks,
[Ericoides]: Sorry, I was pushed for time.
[Ericoides]: Please don't change hooks just because you are unfamiliar with the rules of English grammar. As someone has rightly pointed out, \""its\"" is just as correct as \""it\"". Many thanks,
[Ericoides]: Hi Benea, Sorry about my move of that sub. I realised right after I'd done it that it was a mistake but although I tried I couldn't revert my move. Thanks for doing it.
[Ericoides]: Sorry about this. It was not mean; the diff shows that his contribution was pretty much nonsensical and was so badly written that it couldn't stand as it was. I explained this on his user page; but in future I will not tamper with his credits. I've emailed you in any case.

Mike Rosoft,True,"[Mike Rosoft]: Sincerely,
[Mike Rosoft]: In fact, PipeDown is not the only user to add the material to the [[Mark Barry]] article. I have removed it from the article's history to [[Mark Barry\/hoax]]. -
[Mike Rosoft]: I'd say: no, there is no evidence that the edits have any merit. There are essentially two versions of the article: one of them is a valid stub about the musician, the other a long, barely coherent piece claiming that he was a football hooligan (probable hoax), inserted in place of the real article. -
[Mike Rosoft]: Thanks for your considerations, but \""XYZ is [position]\"" is consistently used in every Wikipedia article about people holding a particular position at the moment (see [[incumbent]] and [[Lists of office-holders]]). Or is there a consensus to change that? -
[Mike Rosoft]: If you believe the article [[Moldova]] should be moved, please list it at [[WP:RM|requested moves]]. Thank you. -
[Mike Rosoft]: The contents you have added is completely unformatted, and I am not sure that it's even encyclopedic (I guess the other editors will decide it; I have listed it at [[WP:CU]]). Please see [[Wikipedia:How to edit a page]] and [[Wikipedia:Manual of style]] for instructions on proper layout of an article. Regards,
[Mike Rosoft]: [[WP:CU]] is just a shortcut for [[Wikipedia:Cleanup]], a listing of pages in need of edits. Nothing will get fixed automatically, but chance is that another user will have a look at it. Personally, I am not even sure where to start; a part of the problem is that lines starting with a space will be displayed as unformatted, fixed-with font text. By the way, where did you get the text? Did you write it yourself, or did you happen to take it from the school website or another outside source? The latter case would be a problem, since you can't use copyrighted material on Wikipedia without a permission of the copyright holder. (See [[Wikipedia:Copyrights]] for details.) -
[Mike Rosoft]: I have attempted to clean up the format of the article; it will probably need to be radically trimmed (and rewritten into prose, not just lists). The copyright will probably note pose a problem, since a mere listing of facts can't be copyrighted. -
[Mike Rosoft]: Well, it's better than it was (at least, it's readable). It probably still needs some work, but it's not somehing I can help you with, so I'll leave it to others. -
[Mike Rosoft]: I apologize if I was too harsh to you in your self-nomination. If you want to know, I don't approve of Israli actions in Palestinian conflict; to the contrary, if I lived in Israel, I would probably be a member of the organization [[Gush Shalom]], or perhaps in jail for refusal to serve in the military. But the point is that Wikipedia has a policy of [[WP:NPOV|neutrality]], and it's not supposed to be [[WP:NOT|a soapbox]]. Regards,
[Mike Rosoft]: You have nominated several templates created by {{User|Sgeo}} for speedy deletion for misrepresenting the policy; I don't see how they meet the criterion, so I have moved them to his user space. Regards,
[Mike Rosoft]: I strongly recommend you to withdraw tour nomination for [[WP:ADMIN|adminship]], as it's <b>highly<\/b> premature. You have made very few edits, almost all of them to your user space. You should try again several months from now, after you have some experience with constructive editing of articles and the [[WP:5P|Wikipedia policies and guidelines]]. Regards,
[Mike Rosoft]: In the end, I have removed the speedy deletion notice from the article, as it makes a claim of notability per [[WP:MUSIC]] - two albums at a somewhat notable label. I recognize that the article has been speedily deleted several times, so if you believe it isn't notable enough, feel free to nominate the page for [[WP:VFD|deletion]]. -
[Mike Rosoft]: Could you please be more specific on what page\/user you talk about? -
[Mike Rosoft]: Simply said, because the article wasn't encyclopedic or even factual. If you want to create a page about your friend (or yourself), get a personal website or a blog. ([[WP:NOT|Wikipedia is not a hosting service]].) -
[Mike Rosoft]: It's not just that the article is unreferenced, but I wasn't able to find any evidence that the sitcom even exists. -
[Mike Rosoft]: Maybe, but I wanted to give it a benefit of doubt. Perhaps {{tl|hoax}}? -
[Mike Rosoft]: The page was originally marked for speedy deletion as [[WP:CSD#G12|copyright violation]]. Instead, I deleted it under a different criterion - as [[WP:CSD#G11|promotional]]. (Given that you are affiliated with the organization, you should have a look at the [[WP:COI|conflict of interest]] guidelines. Generally, it is recommended for users not to create articles about themselves, their companies, etc.) In addition, the name of your account seems to imply that it is a shared corporate account; since an account is only to be used by a single person, I would recommend for you to [[WP:CHU|request its renaming]], or simply create another one. (See the [[WP:UN|user name and user account policy]].) -
[Mike Rosoft]: After reviewing the article and some research using Google, I believe that the game probably is notable enough to have an article on Wikipedia. (On the other hand, [[WP:OTHERSTUFF|existence of other articles about less notable subjects]] isn't a very strong argument for keeping this one; each article must stand or fall on its own.) -
[Mike Rosoft]: That's right, but as far as I can see all edits by unregistered users are of this kind. In fact, the last vandalism has remained on this page for months. That's why I had semiprotected the page. -
[Mike Rosoft]: I don't think that [[WP:OTHERSTUFF]] contradicts community consensus; to the contrary, it repeatedly gets referenced in deletion debates. Granted, results of previous debates may be used as a rough guideline on whether or not to keep a different one (though it is in no way binding; [[WP:CCC|consensus can change]]). Mere existence of another article can't; just as well it can be a reason to nominate the other page for deletion as well. -
[Mike Rosoft]: Because [[East Jerusalem]] is a geographic term with a specific meaning (unlike \""southeast Jerusalem\""). -
[Mike Rosoft]: Read the article [[East Jerusalem]]. -
[Mike Rosoft]: Granted, but there's no point in creating redirects from all-caps titles. (Page titles are case-sensitive.) -
[Mike Rosoft]: \""Southeast Jerusalem\"" means \""South-eastern part of Jerusalem proper\"". \""Southern East Jerusalem\"" means \""Southern part of East Jerusalem [Israeli-annexed area]\"". Har Homa is in the latter, not in the former. -
[Mike Rosoft]: [[Manchester, NH]]? Sure. In fact, it already exists. -
[Mike Rosoft]: For the second time, Har Homa is NOT in southeast Jerusalem [proper], it's in southern East Jerusalem. I consider this point closed; if you want to continue it further, take it to the [[Talk:Har Homa|article talk page]] or [[WP:EA|editor assistance]]. -
[Mike Rosoft]: Granted, the page ([[Filter Platforms Inc.]]) wasn't particularly promotional in nature; on the other hand, it didn't cite any third-party references and only referenced the company's websites. The primary [[WP:CORP|inclusion (notability) criterion]] is: did the subject attract non-trivial coverage in reliable third-party sources? I am afraid the company doesn't seem to meet these guidelines; articles that don't contain any claim of notability or significance may be [[WP:CSD#A7|speedily deleted]] upon discovery by any administrator.<p>If you believe that the article could be salvaged, I might restore it into your user subpage for you to work on. You can also seek advice at [[WP:EA|editor assistance]]. -
[Mike Rosoft]: There is (namely, [[Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations|CheckUser]]), but I suspect it has already been run. (The edits have been so thoroughly redacted that not even [[WP:ADMIN|administrators]] can view them; only a handful of users have such a privilege. If you want to be sure, feel free to contact the [[WP:ARBCOM|Arbitration Committee]].) -
[Mike Rosoft]: I have made a checkuser request at [[Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations]]. -
[Mike Rosoft]: Don't know; you can try contacting the [[WP:ARBCOM|Arbcom]] by e-mail. (There's already an [[WP:ANI#Oversight please|Administrators' noticeboard]] thread.) -
[Mike Rosoft]: The BJAODN has been removed from Wikipedia, but it has found a new home at [http:\/\/bjaodn.org\/ bjaodn.org]. -
[Mike Rosoft]: I have reviewed both the deleted article [[The Real JO]] and the links you had given me, and I found nothing that would persuade me that you are in any way notable. The main notability (inclusion) criterion is: did the subject of the article attract non-trivial coverage in reliable third-party sources? (See also the [[WP:MUSIC|specific notability guidelines for musicians]].) [[WP:NOT|Wikipedia is meant to be an encyclopedia]], which is a compendium of existing knowledge, not a means of making something known.<p>In fact, it is recommended that users do not create articles about themselves; see the [[WP:COI|conflict of interest]] guidelines for more details. -
[Mike Rosoft]: I would recommend contacting [[User talk:King of Hearts|King of Hearts]], who closed the deletion debate. -
[Mike Rosoft]: I am of the opinion that it's redundant to existing articles - [[House of Stuart]] and articles about individual monarchs. Since you have challenged the [[WP:CSD#A10|deletion]], I have brought it to a full deletion debate at [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\/The later stuarts]]. -
[Mike Rosoft]: The article [[DJ stellth]] doesn't cite any [[WP:V|third-party references]] and fails the [[WP:MUSIC|notability (inclusion) guidelines]] - in fact, coverage in reliable third-party sources is the primary notability criterion. In general, a user should not create articles about himself or other topics he is directly connected with; see the [[WP:COI|conflict of interest]] guidelines. ([[WP:NOT|Wikipedia is meant to be an encyclopedia]], which is a compendium of existing knowledge, not a means of [[WP:SPAM|making something known]].) -
[Mike Rosoft]: The main [[WP:CORP|notability (inclusion) guideline]] is the coverage of the company in reliable third-party sources. Your article cited none; instead, it was filled with marketing language. In general, it is recommended that users don't create articles about themselves, their companies, or similar topics they are directly connected with; see the [[WP:COI|conflict of interest guideline]] for more details. -
[Mike Rosoft]: Once again, see above. Is the video notable for anything but being the longest video on YouTube? Do you have any reliable third-party sources that mention the video? If not, then I am afraid Wikipedia won't have an article about it; it's that simple. (See the [[WP:WEB|notability guidelines for web content]].) If you believe that the page indeed meets the inclusion guidelines, consider creating it as a subpage of your user space, e.g. [[User:IksDe\/Origami Box Destroy]], and then seek advice on the [[WP:EA|editor assistance page]]. -
[Mike Rosoft]: As a follow-up, the video doesn't seem to have attracted any coverage in reliable third-party sources. It has been mentioned in the YouTube wiki, and on several blogs etc. - these aren't [[WP:RS|reliable sources]]. -
[Mike Rosoft]: It doesn't matter. The videos [[Charlie Bit My Finger]] and [[Me at the zoo]] did attract third-party coverage, and so they meet the notability guidelines. Origami Box Destroy didn't, so it doesn't. -
[Mike Rosoft]: I have reviewed the article, and it seems that the website has only attracted trivial third-party coverage (see the [[WP:WEB|notability guidelines]] for web content). If you believe otherwise, you can challenge the deletion at [[WP:VFU|deletion review]]. -
[Mike Rosoft]: I tend to agree that the article doesn't quite fit the speedy deletion criteria, so I have undeleted it and sent it to a full [[WP:VFD|deletion debate]] at [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\/Cayole]]. -
[Mike Rosoft]: Wikipedia is not [[Urban Dictionary]], or any dictionary at all. [[WP:NOT|It's an encyclopedia]]. If you can provide a verifiable citation for the term's useage, it could be placed in the Wiktionar. If it's a made-up term, then it has no place either in Wikipedia or Wiktionary. See [[:wikt:Wiktionary:Criteria for inclusion]] and [[:wikt:Wiktionary:What Wiktionary is not]]. -
[Mike Rosoft]: It's not quite kosher to create an article with a \""good article\"" tag in place and claim that two unrelated people marked it as such, is it? (See more about the [[WP:GA|good articles]] process.) That said, I have left a bit of feedback on the article [[Talk:Six Million Crucifixions|talk page]]. -
[Mike Rosoft]: Thanks for the reminder; I have marked the article for insufficient notability, instead. (This automated message does sound condescending a bit, though, especially considering that I have been using Wikipedia longer than you. :-) -
[Mike Rosoft]: {{-)}} -
[Mike Rosoft]: No offense taken :-). -
[Mike Rosoft]: If you believe that the information could have better references, why don't you improve them yourself? Alternately, discuss the changes you intend to make on the article talk page, or ask for help at [[WP:EA|editor assistance]]. -
[Mike Rosoft]: I thought that the article was an attack on an existing wrestling organization. I was wrong; hence, I shouldn't have deleted the article as an attack page, but rather under the [[WP:CSD#A7|speedy deletion criterion A7]] - lack of any claim of significance or notability. See the [[WP:NOTE|notability (inclusion) guidelines]]. -
[Mike Rosoft]: I have deleted the article under the [[WP:CSD#A7|speedy deletion criteria]] for a lack of any claim of [[WP:NOTE|notability]]; coverage in reliable third-party sources is the primary notability criterion. ([[WP:NOT|Wikipedia is meant to be an encyclopedia]], which is a compendium of exsting knowledge, not a means of making something known.) -
[Mike Rosoft]: I have restored the article and moved it to [[User:Geofferybard\/Monastic silence]]. That said, I believe that its topic is so close to the topic of the article [[Vow of silence]] that the information could be included in the page itself. (And the page [[Vow of silence]] has itself been nominated for merging to the main article [[Silence]].) By the way, a YouTube video is not a good reference; see the guideline on [[WP:RS|what constitutes a reliable source]].<p>If you disagree with my evaluation of the article, you can seek advice at [[WP:EA|editor assistance]]. (Should you move the article back to article space, I don't want to be revert warring, either; I'd probably seek advice in the same place.) -
[Mike Rosoft]: Yeah; I have reported the bug at [[Wikipedia:Huggle\/Feedback]]. -
[Mike Rosoft]: Normally, [[WP:HUG|Huggle]] doesn't revert anything on its own - it was probably a mistake on my part. -
[Mike Rosoft]: I would ask {{user|HJ Mitchell}}, who recently unprotected the page with a reasoning that \""somebody wants to do something legit with it\"". I don't think this is what happened - it was immediately created as a Wikipedia self-reference. I count the recent redirecting of the page to [[wiki markup]]\/[[hyperlink]] as another Wikipedia self-reference, so I have deleted it and restored the full protection. -
[Mike Rosoft]: Possibly; it depends on how much of a deletionist the reviewing admin is. (It looks like I was wrong on this article; the author just misspelled Nitte Trust as Net Trust. On the other hand, given the user name of the author, the page could be speedily deleted as [[WP:CSD#G11|self-promotion]].) -
[Mike Rosoft]: Looks like this is not the case. I proposed the page for deletion (\""Not written in encyclopedic style, no third-party references\"") while [[User:Nikthestoned|Nikthestoned]] nominated it for speedy deletion ({{tl|db-promo}} - under which the page was eventually deleted). For some reason, the system didn't report an edit conflict, so I just re-added the speedy deletion notice. -
[Mike Rosoft]: You seemed to have warned the wrong person :-) -
[Mike Rosoft]: Done. -
[Mike Rosoft]: You mean [[Damir Omerbegovi\u0107]] (himself a speedy deletion candidate)? -"

Perhaps you want to check this out and maybe push for protection of the Islam article.
[Anonymous editor]: Thank you for warning me about 3rr. I was acting in goodwill as proposed by [[User:Kmccoy|kmccoy]]'s mediation, by substituting the compromise (temp) version of the article for the disputed one. All previously disputed parts were reworded and entered into that version before to encyclopedia standard. Sam insists on reinserting the same disputed sections plus adding another section into the article without any discussion on the issue! So far he even deleted the compromised part of the article and replaced it with his own. I believe that is unfair to me and all the other editors who were involved in the dispute with him and clearly this shows that he does not want to solve disputes on the article. Please review edit history to see the additional sections that he added and the prior discussions on the talk page. If you do choose to protect this article, I sincerely hope that you will delete the three disputed sections so that it is protected without what all the editors (beside Sam) consider to be irrelevant and disputed. Btw, I was originally there to mediate too, but this issue has escalated with Sam's countless arbitrary decisions.  Please see talk page.Thank you. --

[Anonymous editor]: Also I removed the story before because I think we should give other stories a chance too.

Thank you for your support of this great project. As I'm sure you can appreciate, we have no choice but to block vandalism of our pages. If you have an honest dispute, your fellow editors require you to bring it up on the talk page of the article. Wholesale deletion of entire sections will not be permitted. This is your only warning. --
[BurnOMG]: The vandal in question is trying to delete the '''only''' article on the term [[Terror]]. This is vandalism, plain and simple. You are not superior to your fellow editors. If you promote vandalism out of some misguided sense of loyalty to your friends here on Wikipedia, you will be blocked from editing. In the future, please review the actual case before you recreate the vandalism. Thank you. --
[BurnOMG]: [[Image:Nuvola apps important.svg|25px]] You are being [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocked]] for your vandalism of the [[Terror]] article for 24 hours. You were warned to stop the wholesale deletion of the entire article and you continued deleting it. Please demonstrate your good faith in this matter and refrain from editing for 24 hours. If you break this ban, your fellow editors will have no choice but to make the ban physical and possibly permanent. This is your only warning. Thank you. --
[BurnOMG]: ShelfSkewed turned an article page into a disambiguation page and then deleted the only article on the topic. Your fellow editors expect you to review a case before taking action. Deleting the only information about the term is blatant vandalism. You are to assume good faith and never take action against someone based on the word of another editor. If you do not have time to review the case, do not take action. Deleting the only article on [[Terror]] is vandalism. You have committed vandalism and compounded your mistake by ignoring a warning and committing it again. That is why I have imposed a ban on your editing for 24 hours. Please take the time to review your actions and the case in question if you choose to be involved further. Thank you. --

Canada Hky,False,"[Canada Hky]: Thanks for the review.  I will get to all those within the next day or two.  Schenn is probably still in the prospect stage as an NHL player.  I saw you checked out [[Drew Doughty]]'s article - he's probably a tier or two below Doughty.  He's the great hope of Toronto Maple Leafs fans everywhere, though.
[Canada Hky]: Have addressed most of the issues in the review, still looking for a different reference for the one article for subscribers only (I think it was free access when I wrote it initially).  I'll let you know if I cannot find anything.
[Canada Hky]: Found an additional reference for the Globe and Mail story.  I left the original reference in there as well.
[Canada Hky]: I was going to post this on the talk page for the article, and I guess it could eventually get moved over there - what is the reasoning behind having the Midget AAA championships on the SJHL team page for years that the SJHL team wasn't in existence?  Notre Dame had and has a Midget AAA team that runs exclusive of the SJHL team.  If the team wasn't playing in the SJHL, they weren't an SJHL team, and if they were playing in a Midget AAA league, they weren't a junior team (which is what that article is about).  Properly, shouldn't the succession boxes for those Telus Cup wins be on the school page (or whereever the boxes for the other championships are)?  The SJHL players didn't port over to the midget team, it would be like any other team that ceased to exist in a league for a while.
[Canada Hky]: That kind of makes sense.  I see them as two different entities as well.  I'll see what I can dig up on it around here, I'm sure I've seen their history books in a library in the city.  To me - the same players don't mean its the same team.  It just means they moved up a level, but the Midget team can't be the Jr team (if anything, they probably did it because they could no longer be a Midget team as guys were aging out).
[Canada Hky]: Just finished up the GA Review for Celski.  Please feel free to ask, if anything needs clarifying.
[Canada Hky]: Just passed the article - thanks for your help in completing the review.
[Canada Hky]: Hi, Thanks for your comment on the Taube GA review.  Would you mind taking a look at the section about his history again, and checking to see if I addressed the issue you raised?  I believe I understood what you were meaning, and in the absence of any direct evidence of how his family moved around, I added in general information about German migration to Russia, and then subsequently to North America.  Thanks!
[Canada Hky]: GA review is posted, not too much to take care of.  Drop me a note if anything is unclear."
Gooday.1,False,"[Gooday.1]: Ok, this isn't a compliment, but I've got to tell you this so you don't get the wrong idea. Just because somebody does a bunch of rearranging of info and formatting on an article you wrote doesn't mean what you added is worthless. Yes, saying \""fuck this shit\"" on an article is dumb because that can only result in penalty, but doing the grunt work on highway articles with infoboxes, etc. is better than nothing. So, my point is... if you're think you're trying to help, screw everyone else's insults... take their advice and try not to screw up, but if you do, someone else will fix it. If you're trying to hurt Wikipedia or trying to satisfy your funny bone, then you're in the wrong place. Simple common sense. Now, if you're not an expert in an area, don't try to overthrow someone who is; however, you're input is usually appreciated, so keep on editing... if that's what you want to do. Just learn from mistakes and gain experience. Also common sense. Heck, I wanted to say \""fuck this shit\"" on a bunch of my articles that were reverted... until I realized the reverter was a moron. --
[Gooday.1]: Now that I look through your archives, I see you've been told this before: [[User talk:Elkman\/Archive3|here]]. Get it through your head... or do whatever you want... I guess I really don't care. --"
Mikitei,False,"[Mikitei]: Bread Ninja wasn't even willing to negotiate on this matter and outrage just disagreed with my point of view after asking it. She probably just did it to annoy me. I don't entirely believe that but I got that feeling again when she immediately wrote to me that I was somehow biased and practically just made my day miserable by starting this whole fight again... I am agreeing on some of her changes like removing the comparison about DJMax and other rhythm game which I kept just because I found it interesting while it maybe wasn't really important for the whole picture. Mostly Bread Ninja just removes content and doesn't add anything new on her own to replace or improve the quality of available information. Anyway so I asked for a third party opinion and she gave your talk page as a link to me. For a final thing... I really hope that this is not too much of a trouble. I know this is big and complicated matter which went silent for a few weeks but now is starting to heat again. I hope you can help building these DJMax articles with us since it's now being proven that two people might not be able to solve issues they have together and need a third wheel so that things can progress forward. I am probably just like her. Our will is to improve Wikipedia and articles but our views for doing so conflict too much. Which is sad since if we could work as a pair, we probably would be unbeatable pair in writing interesting articles. PS. This was a reconstruction of my previous comment which my Macintosh ate by making a kernel panic twice. ;_; I apologize for it's possible lack of linear path of thoughts. --
[Mikitei]: Let me also add that most things are negotiable with me. If there's a good reason for removing the photo and people (more than 3) support that action then I can perfectly accept that it just won't be there. But as the things stand I still don't understand why Bread Ninja doesn't want that picture there. What harm does it do? What kind of misinformation it spreads? And in generally what is her problem? (Among the other things and issues.) I so much would like to work with her and I don't see any better showcase of that than those long messages I've sent to her, trying to understand her and hers point of view. I am waiting for your reply. Thanks! :) --
[Mikitei]: Please help me and her. Now she just edited my comments (by adding bold) to give different message. I reverted that and then she reverted it and I had to revert it again. Why can't she just make a quote? Why she often splits lists into smaller pieces and makes her own comments on top of them giving readers false assumption that she wrote them? I have to then practically move them into one group so that things aren't mixed. It alone shows that she doesn't know any proper netiquette. At least in my honest opinion. By the way, is there a problem in my written english language? I admit that I am not a native speaker. Usually I have no problems with talking and communicating with people using english but trying to communicate with her has made me doubt myself quite a bit more than once. :\/ --
[Mikitei]: Yeah, that's enough Jinnai. I trust you... And I understand that point about CEs (\/ LEs) you wrote about. I earlier wrote something similar to Bread Ninja also but she misinterpreted it. If it was just an alternative cover, there'd probably be no point having picture of it. I also wrote something on a similar lines that it is not \""absolutely necessary\"" because it's not important news picture about major event for example. But like in the case of that Lunar game it still has a small valuable reason for being here. And I really do plan to improve the article and improve information about LE box. Black Square's LE box has lots of various stuff packed into it ([http:\/\/www.play-asia.com\/paOS-01-77-3-49-en-85-1-70-36dp.html see here] and [http:\/\/www.play-asia.com\/paOS-01-77-3-49-en-85-1-70-36dp.html here]). It's a huge box and article itself has\/had information about the box, its content and how many where produced and so on... And I can guarantee that once I get the box I'll add free image I've taken myself of it and its content into Wikipedia to replace that image if nothing else emerges. The problems with LE are for example that there's no free image available of it and it's contents. Only free image is the image in question. Of course I could just try to ask people on the net for a free picture which shows the contents. For example [http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/25686043@N03\/3173167232\/in\/photostream\/ here] and [http:\/\/www.protocolsnow.com\/wp-content\/images\/tinypic\/081231_djmax2.jpg here] are two promising pictures but permission for their usage should be asked first. Current picture is better than no picture at all. It shows the size and look of the box. Of course the LE box itself is pretty unique and only comparable thing which comes to my mind is \""[[Nokia N900]] Hackerbox edition\"" which had shiny black box you had to \""[http:\/\/vimeo.com\/8259713 hack]\"" open before you as a selected member of the press got access to it. (Hackerbox was only available to press members and few selected hackers if I remember correctly.) Without a picture of LE I think DJMax Black Square article would be less informative and less interesting article to read. That picture has also been a long time there. Numerous people have been editing the article but Bread Ninja is the first one to object having that picture there. Koreans have the same picture in same connection in their article too. Shouldn't the usage be justified since it adds clear value (albeit not much, until better image arrives) to the article and is not against Wikipedia guidelines on the matter... As for the information about the box... Most DJMax sources are in korean. I don't see it as a problem but apparently it's huge problem for Bread Ninja. Of course trying to verify something without knowing korean is hard then but since services like Google Translate do exist which can give rough image of the content in korean text for english speakers it shouldn't be too big of a problem. Wikipedia IRC channel thought that it's acceptable in most situations when there's no english language sources available which all take priority over everything else. Of course only then (like it stands in [[WP:NOENG]])... And I'll add that this is first time Bread Ninja writes that she got IRC working. It's not a problem of accepting something or not but a problem of understanding what she actually wants to say and how she understands my messages. Her actions are also sometimes completely opposite of what she says. But there's probably no point if we tell you about these things since we are both no good for it. --
[Mikitei]: Just what is going on in her mind? I don't want to offend anyone but this is just absurd. She's like poison to my motivation. I hope we can talk this thing through and resolve this dispute in a civil manner. --
[Mikitei]: I almost forgot to show these sites... It's easy to find these two blog posts about DJMAX Black Square. Both are about \""unboxing\"" DJMAX Black Square Limited Edition... [http:\/\/www.protocolsnow.com\/2008\/12\/31\/dj-max-portable-black-square-limited-edition-dj-max-technica-ultimate-collection\/] and here [http:\/\/koiaichaku.com\/?p=1517]. Sorry about this really fast and bit messy reply. --
[Mikitei]: I know that it doesn't matter what kind of picture it is, you practically always need a permission from its owner \/ person who shot it. There are some cases which might maybe allow free use but studying if it falls there is more complicated than just asking for direct permission. I am sending emails asking from bloggers if they are willing to contribute a picture to Wikipedia. So far many haven't answered and one has refused to give a permission. At the moment I am going through the korean websites and stuff. I find it disappointing that game's official website won't mention the Limited Edition. It's however quickly mentioned few times in developer blogs. But there's nothing worth adding to wikipedia to support the case. For example somewhere they mentioned that \""LE's content has been set few days ago\"". They had this kind of small mentions but I might have missed something. It apparently was more huge deal to developers that \""Clazziquai Edition\"" had been leaked to web before official release and they almost cancelled whole \""Black Square\"" because of that if I understood the text correctly. It was something they had many times in their blogs... Since my knowledge of korean language is very very limited it might take a while I go through korean web sites. I hope you won't get impatient with me. Especially because I don't have that much free time from projects I am working on in university. And I need to rest sometimes too. :) --
[Mikitei]: I strongly disagree. --
[Mikitei]: I am at the moment whenever I have time I am searching stuff like [http:\/\/ruliweb.daum.net\/data\/preview\/read.htm?num=640 this] from the web. In that link developers are being interviewed about Black Square and how they came up with the idea of releasing two titles one for casual and one for hardcore gamers and various other stuff. I know at the moment why the special edition is cube. But I am still searching for better sources for it. There's this guy whom wrote that limited edition's name Quattro means four in italy. Which I checked hold true. It was chosen since the Black Square is the fourth title in the portable series. Limited Edition is cube because of this square analogy, see [http:\/\/blog.lhyeung.net\/lang\/en-uk\/2008\/12\/06\/dj-max-portable-black-square-quattra-limited-edition\/#more-3811 here]. There where only 1500 copies of Black Square Limited Edition (not 1000 like I previously stated) and it's definitely a limited number unlike what Bread Ninja wrote. She didn't obviously understand that there are two editions of the game... normal and this limited edition. Black Square Limited Edition has a ridiculous price point of costing you more than 200\u20ac these days despite the fact that it was released only few years ago (that means price has got a lot higher from 50\u20ac something.). Its a real collector's item. --
[Mikitei]: I've been trying to explain why it's needed and you don't understand my view point. Besides I will talk this over with Jinnai and after that it will be still there, will be replaced, or removed. Or something else will be done to that picture. Please wait. --
[Mikitei]: I really think you should let me and Jinnai talk this out. If Jinnai is clearly on behalf of the removal the it's ok. At the moment, Jinnai has this 50-50 feeling about the matter, staying neutral on the subject. You think that picture should be removed and I think that it should stay there as it is. This is not a consensus as I can see it. You're not even giving me time to search for this stuff. Besides you still haven't answered what kind of negative effect the picture has on the contents of the article. It's only adding value in various forms to the article. Why it should be removed? I would understand your point if the picture had no relation to the contents, would be bad quality, had license issues or something like that. But there's none as far as I know. Of course it would be much better if contents would be shown. But until I get the Limited Edition package or somebody gives permission for a that kind of picture its not going to happen. Can you at least await for Jinnai to actually make a reply on this subject. One other thing I don't like about your change by the way is that you're destroying the list of limited edition contents. That list is easy to read. I guess it's a matter of taste (just like this picture conflict between you and me is) but I think that you're lowering the readability of the article by making a long sentence out of things inside the package. You might as well just remove the whole Limited Edition section if you're doing that. However if you do it I will revert that change since I oppose such actions. Why don't you do something constructive for a change and actually try to write something? Good night! --
[Mikitei]: [[User:Jinnai|Jinnai]], temporarily taking the picture out from the article doesn't sound that bad indeed. However what I am most concerned is that the picture might be removed during that period it is not being used. Can you assure it won't be removed from Commons? I know it probably won't be soon but the possibility is there. Also at which point should we make a deal about bringing the picture back? How much information should be added until it could be added there? I know that if we make a deal about the bringing the picture back at later when certain information or conditions have been met for it... And if I or somebody else meets those requirements we negotiated for bringing it back... Can you assure that it won't start another fight? I think that it's more than likely that for example Bread Ninja probably would not honor that agreement and would probably start saying things like \""it was already discussed and decision was final\"" or \""you're still not meeting the requirements we made a deal about\"". Besides if there's a value (albeit small) that picture adds and it doesn't conflict with policies of Wikipedia why it cannot stay there? Probably easies solution to meet expectations of everyones would be that the current picture is replaced by image which shows the content of the box. Right? ...Hey! I tried to add more text to go with the picture on the [[DJMax Portable Black Square]] page and I hope that you can check it out. Korean gaming sites give small pieces of information I've tried to translate those sentences into a english. It's bit hard to make it quality text because I need to translate korean to finnish and then translate it from finnish to english inside my head. I'll give my reply to Bread Ninja later on... hmm... what else? I just quickly builded [[DJMax Mobile]] article and I was hoping somebody could inspect it. Could you do it? Thanks! Now I'll go to sleep. It's so wrong and immature to stay awake till 4am fighting in Wikipedia about a single picture so often. :) --
[Mikitei]: I have university to attend to and I am not able to do this stuff right now. I got permission for a new better picture which shows the box contents but before the owner changes flickr copyright to CC I pretty much cannot add it. Anyway looks like Bread Ninja acted on her own once again... What should I do with her? I will revert the change she just did and then correct her spelling later on. It's really annoying that she uses word \""consensus\"" when only consensus we have here is pretty much only her own. Besides I would need to do this for 24\/7 to get everything there and I just don't have that kind of time to give for Wikipedia. --
[Mikitei]: And your opinion Bread Ninja is different and you can have different opinion but you don't have authority to decide it alone whenever the image is indeed unnesseary or not and right to remove it just because you think it's \""trial\"" information. That would not be the kind of democracy I expect from Wikipedia users. It would be helpful (and much appriciated) if more opinions are collected about this matter. --
[Mikitei]: Why don't you read your own text? You're not getting what I am saying at all and you're just not even trying to reach agreement here other than what are in alignment with your own goals. And consensus isn't consensus until parties (all three of us) agree to it. And it has not happened if you read the text here. And so far we all have our own opinions about the matter. Besides you're accusing me of something I am not. You're not neutral here. Get more people to back up your opinion. Get more people to talk about this thing at all. You're not building things. And you're not the one whom should be deciding what information goes in and what goes out. Section name should be specific in this case because there's only two releases, normal and limited edition. If there where more than two special packages and both where listed there I could agree with you on more general naming. Other than that it's just distraction and making article hard to read and understand. You where fine with the Black Square article being what it was for years. Why don't me and other people improve it? Please read the conversation... Jinnai has not written the words you wrote in change log of Black Square. --
[Mikitei]: There are people whom find small details interesting and there are people whom don't find them interesting. I guess it's up to us as contributors to determine which details should be in the article. For example, if something was sold in a some price and currently that something has a value which is a lot higher than what it was originally sold, don't you want to know what the original price was? I'd find that interesting information. Besides how you can see that as a something which moves the article out side the neutral point of view? Trivial information would be something like telling \""black square has a song something where a something in a some corner is seen doing something at point something\"" and so on. I would remove that kind of trivial information. Every article on wikipedia is built on top of small but important details (some more than others). If you're only writing about the video game as a what kind of game it is from gamers perspective then you're missing the neutral point. In a way just in a same sentence both denied and admitted that you support removing of the information... I think that your perspective is highly one sided considering what the matter is just as much you think mine is. This probably calls for a more opinions about the matter. I hope Jinnai can come up with clear answer. I'm off to read for swedish exam... Good night! --
[Mikitei]: Bread Ninja, I can say those same words back to you. You don't seem to have neutral view on the subject and you just remove what you feel like instead of thinking if its needed or not. That's why you're promoting censorship. --
[Mikitei]: I am taking Wikipedia's side as well here. Problem is that Wikipedia doesn't define good or bad in cases like these. We can both happily work for the Wikipedia and still have a completely different point of views. Both of us have one goal in mind. Improving the articles. What is different is our methods. --
[Mikitei]: I want you to know that I probably won't be able to come to Wikipedia for the rest of the week. I am having really busy time now in real life. --
[Mikitei]: Also Bread Ninja, when article is short stub there isn't nothing to clean. First somebody builds a rough version of the article and then community starts thinking what is really important and what isn't. If you start cleaning the article while somebody is building it you're just going to ruin his\/her motivation for building articles in the first place. Please keep that in mind. --
[Mikitei]: Jinnai, can you explain to me where we are right now? What is going on in this topic? What is going to happen with the picture? Bread Ninja is bringing here stuff that I don't feel belongs to this subject anymore and I am not sure if she even has a goal she wants to meet. I think she doesn't understand the point here at all and does what she pleases. I have a long reply (actually two) for her which mostly just consists of lecturing her on philosophical subjects related to this matter which I feel is pretty far off of the actual point... actual point being about \""what is going to happen to that image?\"". I don't feel like submitting that reply. Most importantly I feel that the image has its place and it's right at home where it is currently. It has a job and it does it. Albeit it could do it better. By the end of the month or early next month I can probably take a picture of the limited edition package with its contents laid before it and upload it to commons to replace the current image which just shows the box. And that's just maybe since the limited edition is really rare. If I do that is it ok solution for Bread Ninja who obviously want the current image out of there? It's hard to get anything concrete out of her. Jinnai, you've seen what kind of english she writes and I just cannot take her seriously anymore. My objective here is to have at least one DJMAX article which has a single picture to show what kind of limited editions DJMAX series has. I feel that it's worth a picture. Not every DJMAX article needs it. Just one article is fine. Something you can refer to in a main [[DJMax]] article. Since Bread Ninja is not doing article writing (= work towards the goal of improving it) I feel that this is getting pointless. If she really was doing something to improve the article up to next class she would start contributing stuff instead of just ruining the articles with her low class copyediting. --
[Mikitei]: I have few more paragraphs about these things you've written in this thread I feel I haven't really given my reply. Like I wrote to Jinnai, I don't feel like submitting them all since they are off-topic replies to your off-topic sentences. I wrote them so that you would understand my view point better to this subject but I don't know if I should even try showing them for more than a few reasons. :) --
[Mikitei]: You can believe what ever you want but I am adding the image just because article calls for it. I am arguing here that you're removing it because you're not rational on this topic. Oh by the way, what about the random picture about game boxes the [[Halo (series)]] article has? Halo (series) article generally has pictures you probably would seem unworthy but it's still a \""good\"" quality article. I see a contradiction here between you and others in a articles like those which have bit similar conditions and still have just accepted the image despite what you deem as a absolute direction. --
[Mikitei]: Bread Ninja, More importantly I haven't touched your comments like you can see here: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Jinnai&oldid=423815720, That is your edit and your comment. I don't know why you started editing your own comments and then starting to accuse me of editing your comments. Please keep that out of this debate. That's really dirty of you. --
[Mikitei]: Are you aware Bread Ninja, that you generally don't organize your replies properly? Because of you there was few times when Jinnai didn't even noticed the message I left for him. I think so because no reply written for me in this thread albeit I can see from the logs that Jinnai was active during that time and wrote a reply to you. You wrote so much that comprehending everything is difficult and replying to you often requires even longer reply message. I just feel bad for the sake of Jinnai. --
[Mikitei]: I strongly disagree with your first paragraph but anyway... About second paragraph: OK. Until then... However I promise that I'll change the picture to something better soon. I'll show the picture first to you before doing any changes. --"

If the person responsible for that link is not commercially motivated, why not remove the link? The pictures of prostate muscles are not central to the prostatitis page.

[Kathryn_NicDhàna]: A note on my comment about the need for POV and accuracy flags on the article, or at least on the last version I saw of it. I think it is important that the article's name accurately reflect its focus. My concern with the article is that a Wiccan\/Graves\/Modern-Feminist-Spirituality interpretation has been misrepresented as *the* \""Neopagan\"" perspective. Neopaganism is diverse, and only some faiths pay any attention to the Maiden-Mother-Crone thing. My concern with the article all along is that it should not imply that all Pagans, Heathens, or Neopagans see \""triple Goddess\"" as meaning Graves' modern Maiden-Mother-Crone configuration. I've seen too many shoddy, Newage and Neopagan writers abuse this theory and try to shove Goddesses like Brighid, An Mhorr\xedghan, and various other historical Goddesses into that ill-fitting format. It's a format that is irrelevant to many traditional cultures. So I think we need to be very careful to not make it sound like \""Neopagan\"" = Wicca. In my low level participation there in the past, I tried to make this clear, but Davemon made it a [[WP:BATTLE]]ground environment, and I just don't care enough about the article to fight with him. This is how editor after editor has been discouraged from working on the article. I don't think Davemon understands the field well enough to make some of these calls. Or if he does, he just doesn't care. - <font face=\""Georgia\"">

[Happysomeone]: This is an FYI, I suppose, but there has been some substantial rewriting attempted at the old Tea Party protests page, now moved to the [[Tea Party movement]]. It also split off a daughter article, [[Tea Party protests, 2009]]. Instead of freeing up editors to keep the moved page more topical and keep the '09 protests paired with all the historic info and developments, a concerted effort has emerged that in my view is not much more than page blanking and deleting anything that seems to paint things in a negative light.--

Marcd30319,False,"[Marcd30319]: Dana, thanks for taking the initiative on my laundry list.  Regarding the [[WUDO]], the organization existed for slightly over three years, and while the ''TIME'' magazine article (Note 2) mentioned a land exercise planned for the Fall of 1949 as a follow up to [[Exercise Verity]].  However, I haven't found any subsequuent mention of that exercise.  So it appears that Exercise Verity was the only major military operation undertaken by the WUDO.  In any case, it seems that WUDO was a placeholder for the eventual creation of [[NATO]] and [[SHAPE]].  Your thoughts?

[Marcd30319]: Thank you, Buckshot, for [[User_talk:Marcd30319#Command_histories|your messsage regarding the U.S. Navy command histories]].  Quite frankly, I have had concerns about this.  I initially tried to  do just as you suggested, adding the command histories to the bibliography or external links of the article of the specific ship, but I got a message from [[User:RP459]] about the {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65}} questiong this, so I came up with the List alternative approach.  I even got an '''Original Barnstar''' from [[User:RP459]] on 9 September 2010 for this solution.  Maybe you and RP459 can discuss this and get back with me, or we can kick this over to [[User:The ed17]] at [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Military history]] who is very good at resolving these issues.

Ckatz,True,"[Ckatz]: Good point - take a look now. I've updated the link list at the top of the article. --
[Ckatz]: I think you two have worked out a good solution to the \""city conundrum\"". Thanks for resolving this issue. --
[Ckatz]: Cool... thanks for doing that. I've checked out the page before and had planned to apply to use it. No time like the present, eh? --
[Ckatz]: Wow, looks good. You put a lot of work into it, and it shows. Some problems, though - one, we lose the diagonals, which is a fair bit of information. Two, the arrow icons invite people to click on them, which leads to the image page. This will (I think) be somewhat confusing for most readers, so you might want to consider using arrows from a character set (as opposed to Wiki images). --
[Ckatz]: Hey, forgot to leave you a note re: the latest update. Take a look at your sandbox when you get a chance, and let me know what you think. --
[Ckatz]: I liken it to the directions assigned to highways - a \""north\"" route doesn't always head exactly north, but it's the best approximation of which way you'll be travelling. Food for thought, so let's keep this discussion going. --
[Ckatz]: Very kind - it's important to try and get your ideas in there too. The part that I'm least keen on is having multiple entries for the '''same''' municipality (i.e. (SW)Vancouver - (S)Vancouver - (SE)Vancouver). If we can address that issue, I wouldn't be so bothered by having, say, Surrey and Delta in the same cell. On the subject of the empty spaces (which I think can be a good feature if used appropriately), what do you think of the idea of using some colour-coding? I was thinking that we could colour the backgrounds of the individual cells with a very light green or blue (for land or water) to visually tie the cells together. I'll be playing around with the coding later tonight ([[User:Ckatz\/Workspace\/Templates|here]]) so if you have suggestions please leave a note - colour ideas, styles, \""No, Ckatz, the idea isn't worth the paper it's printed on\""... (OK, maybe not the last one!) Cheers! --
[Ckatz]: I might ask you what your reason is for persisting in this, frankly, rather pathetic edit war. You've already been [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:ED209&oldid=64965708 taken to task by an admin] for ignoring established Wiki procedure, and it was quite a scolding at that. [[User:Pm shef|Pm shef]] obviously has an agenda too, he really should clearly state his personal and professional connections to the Vaughan political process, and he's certainly not without fault in this matter. '''However''', and this is an important point, he at least appears to be doing something on Wikipedia '''other than arguing endlessly about a municipal election.''' I mean, really, get a life already. This is an encyclopedia project with a global audience. '''Absolutely no-one''' in their right mind cares about this, '''unless''' they're from Vaughan. (I'd wager that there are probably a lot of Vaughan residents who would cringe if they knew what sort of presence their (town?city?district?) now has on the Web.) To be perfectly honest, I didn't even know where Vaughan was before I happened to stumble across this dispute, and after watching it for quite some time, I'm even less impressed. If you want to add a controversial point, take it to the talk page and hammer out a compromise. If you aren't satisfied with the results, then there are other avenues to explore in terms of expanding input into a difference of opinion. Why this article exists is beyond me -- it would make more sense to just Afd the thing and hope it goes away. --
[Ckatz]: Thanks for catching that - I only intended to remove the \""social fabric\"" and \""lifestyle\"" edits, and retain the burner info. --'''
[Ckatz]: No, what I wanted to do was remove the text about grow-ops and the homeless, pending verification, since they are two of the topics that tend to get thrown into articles by issue-driven contributors. The burners, however, are not a \""controversial\"" subject, so, while I couldn't personally verify their existence within the stated timeframe, it did not seem outside the realm of possibility. I thought I'd ask, however, as there are a few editors frequenting the Vancouver project who seem to have a really good knowledge of BC's history. Thanks again. --'''
[Ckatz]: Some of your changes had to be reverted since they were contrary to the WP:MOS for disambiguation pages. I've left a full explanation at [[Talk:Eris#Re: Nfitz's edits|Talk:Eris]]. Cheers! --'''
[Ckatz]: I'm sorry, but I have no idea which index you're referring to - you are editing from what must be a changing IP address, so I can't trace your edit history to establish where we crossed paths. However, if you could please provide some more details, I would be happy to discuss it further.  (As an aside, you might wish to consider establishing a user name, as that would give you a stable talk page and allow you to receive notification about new messages and changes to pages you are following.) --'''
[Ckatz]: I'll check them out. Thanks. --'''
[Ckatz]: Nbound - just to let you know that I've removed the \""Brisbane\"" entry from the price table. I've nothing against Brisbane in particular, but the table should only have one entry per nation or it will quickly become unmanageable. If you prefer Brisbane to Sidney, I'll swap it around. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: I agree - it would be nice to see a range, as there's often a disparity in pricing across nations. (It's certainly that way in Canada!) As I mentioned, adding new rows to the table is problematic, as the size will quickly become unmanageable. However, perhaps the solution is to have one row per nation with a range incorporated into the price (such as \""$1.00-$1.50\/liter\""). Thoughts? --'''
[Ckatz]: I appreciate your concern. However, it is important to remember that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia project, not a PR website. The information about Huang Biren's year of birth is a matter of public record, and it is certainly appropriate to a biographical article about her. There is no rational reason for removing the birth year. --'''
[Ckatz]: It's important to note that I never accused you of vandalism or malicious behaviour; in fact, I recognized your intent. However, the manner in which you approached the cleanup was not the best way to do it. Instead of just deleting numerous discussions and replacing them ('''repeatedly''') with the same warning message, you should have created a proper page archive. --'''
[Ckatz]: No apologies needed - it's all about learning here. I'd offer tips on how to archive, but I've never actually done one myself. If I get a chance, I'll try to read up on it and help out. Cheers! --'''
[Ckatz]: Your reasoning, while valid in some situations, is not required here. We are talking about a reference to a handful of cities, all of which are listed by name only. They can easily be listed in a sentence (as I did), which improves the layout of the page. Otherwise, we are left with large areas of blank space, and an overly long page, for no particular reason. As to your second point, [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Ckatz&diff=82975433&oldid=82556129 now deleted], it would be helpful if you could demonstrate some maturity and stop making spiteful, baseless accusations.  As I told you before, I have no idea what your dispute with Mr. Fenton is, nor do I care. I only asked that you demonstrate restraint by refraining from continuously sniping at him on the Jericho pages. I do not appreciate you then accusing me of blindly supporting him just because I edited your text. Finally, if you are discussing a matter relating to the Jericho article, please keep the conversation on that talk page. --'''
[Ckatz]: This refers to the [[Battlestar Pegasus]] article, where [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Battlestar_Pegasus&diff=86013535&oldid=85989939 you deleted] the text:<blockquote>''\""Glen Larsen, producer of Battlestar Galactica, attempted a revival in the late 1990s with a feature film project using Commander Cain and the Battlestar Pegasus.\""''<\/blockquote> and left the [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Battlestar_Pegasus&action=history edit summary] ''\""Uncited and liekly fan cruft so exterminate.\""'' It took all of ten seconds for me to do a quick Google search and confirm the information. All I'm asking is that you take the time to check out plausible information, rather than just deleting it and leaving a sarcastic comment. --'''
[Ckatz]: Well, I never said you didn't have the \""right\"" to do it - I merely asked if you could be a bit more polite about the way you go about doing it. If you wish to think of this as a \""job\"", then you might also want to consider that labelling your edit with ''\""Uncited and liekly fan cruft so exterminate\""'' isn't particularly professional. The possibility of a film involving the BSG universe is a noteworthy addition to an article about BSG, so you could easily have added a \""citation\"" tag and waited a few days to see if anyone responded. --'''
[Ckatz]: Matthew, it wasn't exactly \""discussed\"" - you said ''\""Removed the ship table as we dont know much about the XCV and also the Starfleets are diffrent, so.. dont add it back thank you.\""'' and deleted it. Also, it doesn't matter if another ship named \""Enterprise\"" turns up someday; we have to act based on what we know '''now'''. The template is for moving between articles about ships named \""Enterprise\"", not for establishing an absolute record of said ships. --'''
[Ckatz]: No problem - I've forgotten before, and I always appreciated it when someone did the same for me. --'''
[Ckatz]: You're welcome! I appreciate the note, and the BSG information as well. Cheers! --'''
[Ckatz]: No problem whatsoever, and no apologies needed - I presumed it was due to the edit overlap. As for MARTA, thanks for the information. Cheers! --'''
[Ckatz]: It's part of the [[Wikipedia:Accessibility|Wikipedia accessibility guidelines]] ([[WP:WAI]]), and the specific section is [[Wikipedia:Accessibility#|here]]:<blockquote>''\""Disambiguation links should be the first elements of the page, before any image or infobox. A text only browser or screen reader present the page sequentially, and otherwise the dablink will be read between the image and the lead section.\""''<\/blockquote> It's a common mistake, as many editors move the top-of-page templates for esthetic purposes. However, it creates problems for people who use screen readers. Hope this helps. --'''
[Ckatz]: Based on activity, I guess. I monitor several hundred different articles that I've worked on, for changes and vandalism, as well as doing the odd bit of vandal patrol work. When an editor's actions warrant it, I'll leave a warning on their talk page (which is how I crossed paths with this editor) and the Wiki software automatically adds that talk page to my watchlist. After allowing time for them to reply,  I remove the page (otherwise my watchlist gets way, way too bulky and s-l-o-w). However, if there's an apparent pattern, I'll keep an eye out for a while - which led to a note on Sw's page today, hence (I presume) the question. As far as I know, the Wiki software won't allow you to check out other watchlists, for privacy reasons. (Perhaps administrators can, but I don't know as I'm not an admin.) Hope this helps! --'''
[Ckatz]: Based on the Wikipedia articles about the [[United Soccer Leagues]] and [[Major League Soccer]], it would appear that the USL '''is''' the largest '''system''', as it encompasses three men's divisions, a women's league, and a youth league, whereas the MSL is a single league with 13 teams. The MSL is the top-'''level''' division, and perhaps that is what you were referring to. However, the text in the lead would need to be rewritten to reflect that fact. I've started a discussion at the [[Talk: Vancouver Whitecaps#Size of league|Whitecaps talk page]] to figure out how best to handle this. (BTW, it's not really \""common knowledge\"" unless you actually follow soccer.) --'''
[Ckatz]: Sorry you feel that way about bilingualism - perhaps it might help if you didn't view it as \""us versus them\"". Frankly, I think it makes the country that much more interesting. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hmm... you're right, that does need a tweak. The coding is a little different than what I'm used to, so I'll try to read up on it and see if it can be adjusted. Nice job, once again, for reformatting and creating the new look. --'''
[Ckatz]: Mike, your links are to a commercial site that is contrary to Wikipedia's [[WP:EL|guidelines]] for external links. As such, they are being removed - not just by me, but by a host of other editors. You are compounding the problem by spamming them across a series of pages, and repeatedly re-adding them. Please read [[WP:EL]] to better understand why your links are not suitable. Thank you - remember that you are always welcome to contribute to Wikipedia, as long as you follow the project guidelines. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Please do not make [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Ckatz&diff=95677975&oldid=95655411 empty threats] in an attempt to justify your [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Stanley_Park&diff=95677414&oldid=95674071 actions] at [[Stanley Park]]. If you had read the edit history first, you would be aware that your material duplicated text that was already in the article, and more appropriately placed. Furthermore, if you had investigated, you would have seen that I made an effort to incorporate your material into the existing text. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, you [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Stanley_Park&diff=95677414&oldid=95674071 blindly reverted] back to your last edit, completely ignoring the fact that you [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Stanley_Park&diff=95677414&oldid=95674071 obliterated a lot of work by several other editors]. Please use more caution, and consider discussing your concerns on the talk page first. Thank you. --'''
[Ckatz]: No problem... I wasn't either, until a template I created was modified. Of course, it being a user box, you're always welcome to propose a change if you prefer a different style. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: No problem at all - just had to ensure that some of the templates didn't persist, such as the Vandalproof software tag etc. Enjoy. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the note. As for the Antarctic 'claim\"", there's no mention of it at the [https:\/\/www.cia.gov\/cia\/publications\/factbook\/geos\/ay.html CIA World Factbook] or the [http:\/\/www.asoc.org\/general\/ats.htm Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition] websites, no results for a Google search (news and web), or on some other Antartica pages I looked at. Wikipedia requires solid references for text, and in the absence of that, we've no choice but to remove the text about the supposed \""stateless person\"" territorial claim. --'''
[Ckatz]: I wil certainly participate in an RfM, if need be, but be advised that I do not take kindly to your actions in this matter. Without any pause for discussion whatsoever, you jumped into the fray and began leaving \""WARNING\"" messages on my page and on those of other users. This is not the appropriate manner in which to achieve consensus, and I think that an RfM would indeed highlight that fact. --'''
[Ckatz]: Ummm... I think that you're looking at TWO sentences. If you'd like to critique, by all means go ahead - but I want to double-check to see if you've misread this particular example. --'''
[Ckatz]: Again, your first reaction is to toss around accusations. If you wish to claim that I am \""vandalizing\"", please provide concrete examples. If not, then don't make insinuations that are groundless. --'''

Prior to that, another editor had to revert you at [[Torchwood]] for adding [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Torchwood&diff=prev&oldid=100232639 \""Chief of Stupidity\""]. Those were your only two edits that day, so it was clear that you weren't serious about making positive contributions. --'''
[Ckatz]: It's not a question of your intent, it's whether it is appropriate for a discussion on an '''article''''s talk page. In this case, it wasn't, and so it was removed. To be honest, if I hadn't done it, someone else would have, possibly going a step farther and adding a warning note. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... no problem replying here. As for the return to \""is\"", it's based on parts of the style guide, examples of other articles, and related discussions. I'll give you what links I can off the top of my head, and try to add to the list as I find more examples. (Unfortunately, there's nothing concrete in the Style Guide that spells out a guideline, as I discovered while trying to find an answer to a related topic a few months back.) Generally speaking, writing about fiction is to be done in what the MoS calls the \""[[Wikipedia:Guide to writing better articles#Check your fiction|perpetual present tense]]\"". Beyond that, an unwritten but oft-repeated  convention seems to be that a work of fiction '''still exists''', regardless of whether or not it is out of production. That is to say, [[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]] still \""is\"" a film, [[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]  and [[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]] still \""are\"" television series; and [[Calvin and Hobbes]] and [[Peanuts]] still \""are\"" comics. They don't cease to '''be''' films, TV shows, or comics just because there is no new product. However, we would then switch to past tense to describe the production dates (i.e. ''\""Peanuts '''is''' a syndicated daily and Sunday comic strip written and illustrated by Charles M. Schulz, which '''ran''' from 2 October 1950, to 13 February 2000...\""''). Here's a [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Television#Was vs. Is|related discussion]] at the Television project. I tend to agree with the idea of \""is\"", despite the potential for grammatical clunkiness, but either way I'd like to see some sort of guideline emerge as it would help a lot in clarifying one aspect of the project's style. Please let me know what you think of this, and I can incorporate it into some sort of push for a discussion about establishing a guideline. Thanks. --'''
[Ckatz]: No subterfuge intended, of course - I didn't hear back from you, so I presumed you weren't too bothered by the page. Anyway, I'll try to look through it once again to see if there's anything that can be tweaked. Thoughts? --'''
[Ckatz]: If you review the edit history at both [[Runaway production]] and [[Hollywood North]], you'll see that I'm not just \""blatantly reverting\"" you - I am making a concerted effort to incorporate your points into the text. However, that does not extend to just leaving every single word you wrote intact, as much of your material requires a major overhaul to suit an encyclopedia article. Examples include:<blockquote>''though proclaiming that unilaterally in an effort to promote his city doesn't make it true''<\/blockquote> and <blockquote>''\""Hollywood North\"" is not clearly understood as to what exactly it is; but it is clearly not to be confused with the actual cities or long-time film communities of [[Hollywood, California]] or [[North Hollywood, California]]. \""Hollywood North\"" the [[protologism]] does own its name however, to [[Hollywood, California]], the most notable [[film]] centre in the world.''<\/blockquote>The goal is to provide a \""neutral\"" article - that means that any inaccuracies on the Canadian side should be corrected, but it also means that you can't just rewrite the text to push the American industry point of view. It is also appropriate to discuss major overhauls of an article on the talk page '''first''', especially when there is an ongoing dispute over content. --'''
[Ckatz]: And - once again - I would ask that you avoid making misleading accusations about anyone who disagrees with you. In this case, your messages imply that \""I\"" have threatened to have you banned, or that I have put graffiti and threats on your talk page, and several other comments. I HAVE DONE NO SUCH THING, and any examination of the history of our interactions will reveal just that. (In fact, I have NEVER left a message on your talk page. Why? Becuase you tend to delete comments from it, so it is easier and more reliable to interact with you on the article talk page.) Please be civil, at least. --'''
[Ckatz]: I swapped in \""notable\"", but it didn't read quite right in this context - so I've removed it altogether. What do you think of \""pioneering\""? --'''
[Ckatz]: Agent86: Thanks for the note. Whichever template you think is more appropriate, please go ahead and apply it. The \""POV\"" tag is there only because it's what was on the page last night; I didn't do anything more than a straight revert. I'm hoping (hoping hoping hoping) that with a lot of patience, I can get some sort of compromise to work, both at \""Runaway\"" and at \""Hollywood North\"". Both are (IMHO) valid topics, and both article could also use some fleshing out. HN needs to be more than just a definition - it could benefit from a bit of history and industry reaction so that it doesn't get tagged as a \""yay us\"" piece. \""Runaway\"" could use some input from the \""other side\"" - what other nations think about incentives, and why they use them. It could also use some exploration of the other reasons for productions leaving Hollywood - it's not all about cost, as there are issues such as location burnout that factor into it as well. Anyway, sorry to talk your ear off - but you're an interested party who'se not caught up in the [[maelstrom]] yet... Thanks again. --'''
[Ckatz]: Again, check the show's page at CBS.com. That is the list of characters - 12 in total, not including any of the ones you added. The fact that you created an article about a character on a TV show does not make him or her a \""main\"" character, it just means that there is an article. You can still link to your article from the entry in the \""minor\"" characters section. --'''
[Ckatz]: Once again, it does not matter if you, or I, or a TV reviewer, or anyone else thinks a particular role is \""important\"". The show's producers and the network decide who the \""stars\"" are, and who gets promoted as such, in conjunction with union agreements. The Jericho \""Wiki\"" is not the same as the official site, and - even if it was - the deputies are listed under \""supporting characters\"". I could write an article about the guy who died from radiation poisoning (just as you did for the two deputies) but it still wouldn't make him a main character. I'm going to restore the list to what it should be based on the official CBS website, as your own examples prove that the changes you've made do not reflect the actual character list. Please take your concerns to the article talk page if you wish to seek a change, rather than just changing the article over and over again. Thanks. --'''
[Ckatz]: On a related note, thank you both for your participation at [[Runaway production]] and [[Hollywood North]]. Perhaps more than anything, this situation could really benefit from \""new blood\"" sifting through the conflicting contributions and sorting out what is appropriate. I'd also appreciate any advice you can provide me on how best to approach this matter as an editor - constructive criticism is always welcome. Thanks. --'''
[Ckatz]: If you have a dispute over the \""Awards\"" table, please take it up with [[User:Wizardman|Wizardman]]. The material wasn't deleted, it was incorporated into the body of the article. As for the \""semiprotected\"" tag, your use of it is inappropriate because the action of adding the tag does '''not''' actually protect the page. (Note, too, that this is at least the seventh time this template has been improperly applied to the page, including at least three attempts by you.) If you wish to seek protection for the page, you should go through proper channels and file a protection request. --'''
[Ckatz]: Please don't remove the \""unreferenced\"" tag - it serves to alert editors that an article needs some form of citation in order to support the text. This shouldn't be interpreted as a critique of the subject, only as a notice to ensure that deficiencies are addressed in a timely fashion. --'''
[Ckatz]: You have to provide proof that the material in the article is true, and verifiable. That means supplying links to sources - books, articles, websites - that fit under Wikipedia's [[WP:RS|guidelines]] for citations. I don't know what web site you're referring to (as it's not listed in the article) but generally speaking it has to be a reputable source, not a blog or a personal page. Hope this helps. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... I saw your request at the Village Pump. There is some code you can add to your monobook.js file to add an \""unwatch\"" link to your watchlist. You can find it [[User:Ilmari Karonen\/unwatch.js|here]]. I installed it a few weeks back, and haven't encountered any problems to date. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: It's pretty much a cut-and-paste edit. You copy the text in the box at [[User:Ilmari Karonen\/unwatch.js|Ilmari Karonen's page]] into your monobook.js file at [[User:Tvoz\/monobook.js]], making sure not to delete anything that's already in there. You then save that edit, and flush out your Internat browser's cache to see the changes. (For Firefox\/Mozilla\/Safari: hold down \""shift\"" while clicking RELOAD (or press Ctrl-Shift-R); for Internet Explorer: press Ctrl-F5; for Opera\/Konqueror: press F5.) The \""un\"" tag will show up on your watchlist next to items; clicking it removes the article. If you decide you want to remove the code, the easiest way is to revert yourself or undo the specific edit where you added this code. Good luck~ --'''
[Ckatz]: You might wish to read the following news items ([http:\/\/www.financialexpress.com\/fe_full_story.php?content_id=113572 NDTV, Astro, Value Labs to buy out Red FM] and [http:\/\/us.indiantelevision.com\/headlines\/y2k7\/feb\/feb64.htm Radio Today in talks to dilute 20 per cent to foreign strategic investor]), which explain how Red FM was sold to a consortium of NDTV, Value Labs, and Astro in 2006. --'''
[Ckatz]: Yes, I've checked that - the radio page gives a \""not available\"" message. Various news items ([http:\/\/www.indiantelevision.com\/headlines\/y2k6\/jan\/jan22.htm here's another one]) indicate there was a change in ownership as well. --'''
[Ckatz]: I won't revert for now, but I don't think it was necessary to remove all of the US units, as you did at [[Ceres (dwarf planet)]]. My point (in agreeing with Michael's removal of the escape velocity converison) was that it doesn't make sense to have one conversion at Ceres, while the other \""major\"" bodies (planets and dwarf planets) do not have the same conversion. If someone wants to do all of them at once, that would be a different matter. As it is right now, the removal of the US units from Ceres compunds the problem in that Ceres is now even more out of sync with the other infoboxes. --'''
[Ckatz]: Case in point - the addition of that material by [[User:Toddles29]] recently. It was done across all of the bodies at the same time for consistency. --'''
[Ckatz]: If you're referring to [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Battlestar_Galactica_%282004_TV_series%29&diff=109372085&oldid=109349394 this edit], I believe that you may have misread the edit history. As my comment (''\""Undid revision 109341872 by 69.77.132.17 (talk) rm. trivia\""'') states, I only removed some trivia about a mention of BSG on ''The Office''. This is in keeping with [[WP:TRIVIA|Wikipedia guidelines]] on avoiding trivia. [[User:Thethinredline|Thethinredline]]'s work on the \""Theology\"" section hasn't been altered. --'''
[Ckatz]: No problem at all. While I find the \""Undo\"" feature to be very useful, especially for removing entrenched vandalism, the default comment can be a bit hard to decipher. With all the text about '''who''' is being undone, the '''what''' tends to get lost. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... I saw your note at [[Talk:Pluto]]. As I stated there, I have no preference either way, and will go with consensus. The previous change was reverted because it was only changed at \""Pluto\"", there was no comment or explanation as to why, and (perhaps most importantly) because of [[User:Something14]]'s '''long''' history of making edit on Pluto-related articles to marginalize the \""dwarf planet\"" designation. Again, though, I'll go with whatever the group wants. Cheers, and thanks for bringing it up. --'''
[Ckatz]: Fair enough. So your thought is to go with the unbracketed version? [[Talk:Minor planet names#1 Ceres vs. (1) Ceres|This discussion]] seems to suggest that the \""official\"" method is to use brackets. However, it also gives examples of official usage with unbracketed numbers, and makes a good point about the unbracketed variant being more in line with the way astronomy articles are named on Wikipedia. Thoughts? --'''
[Ckatz]: Likewise - although I'm glad you decided to go with the version you did. Besides matching the related articles, I like the look better. Thanks. --'''
[Ckatz]: FYI, your page moves have been reverted. Wikipedia guidelines for page names dictate using the simplest name, not naming for consistency. --'''
[Ckatz]: No problem. It's certainly not the first time this has occurred on Wikipedia, and I can appreciate the desire for a consistent approach. The discussions over disambiguation - whether to go for the simplest name, or to go for consistency - have been rather heated at times, so I thought I would adjust your changes before you got caught up in the issue... Cheers, and good work BTW. --'''
[Ckatz]: I've restored a lot of the reference details that were removed by MatheoDJ, as well as fixing some other changes from the same edits. I'd appreciate it if you could please look over the article to make sure that the information you added is still present. Thanks. --'''
[Ckatz]: An editor has asked for a [[Wikipedia:Deletion review#{{{2|Duck on a Rock}}}|deletion review]] of [[:Duck on a Rock]]. Since you closed the deletion discussion for this article or speedy-deleted it, you might want to participate in the deletion review. '''
[Ckatz]: They're actually links to unofficial, advertising-supported blog site which do not meet [[WP:EL]]. --'''
[Ckatz]: Whoops... thanks for catching that. It's been really hard to keep track over the past while. I've made the change (and I notice that the page is now protected as well.) Cheers! --'''
[Ckatz]: It isn't a matter of whether or not there is a spoiler tag - it is that the material isn't considered encyclopedic. That level of detail about a series is better suited to a fan site, or to the ''Jericho'' wiki. --'''
[Ckatz]: Re: whether or not the Haitian is deceased. My bad - if Mohinder talks about killing him, then fair enough. Apologies for not catching that, and thanks for being so good-natured about it! (As you said, we have worked well together. Cheers!) --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello again... sorry it took a while to get back to you. I don't think the blog would suffice, as the writer appears to be guessing as well. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... sorry it took a few days to get back to you. I'll see what I can do with regards to the image. (I haven't done a lot of image declarations, but it is about time to learn...) Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hopefully it will be OK now. I've reworked an existing declaration from a promotional image used on the [[Kiefer Sutherland]] page. Please let me know what you think. --'''
[Ckatz]: No problem... good catch on the ''Private Eye'' text. My apologies for not leaving a note for you regarding the change - I was in a bit of a rush. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hmmm... I'd thought I just restored the ''Shrek'' text, but apparently I accidentally restored the \""Private Eye\"" text as well. Sorry about that - it has since been removed by another editor. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Dposse - you may wish to check out [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Television#Episode redirects|this issue]] regarding television episode articles. I've filed an AN\/I report on it, but it may be a difficult slog. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news. --'''
[Ckatz]: I've also left [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Heroes#Warning regarding episode articles|a note]] on the ''Heroes'' project page. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Done. (Generally speaking, unreferenced trivia should be weeded out.) Thanks for mentioning those two. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... sorry to bug you, but I just wanted to see what the story was with that page. (I had several not-so-nice messages from the creator after a redirect because of the content fork, and as such the explanation on the deletion log concerns me.) Did the editor file some sort of complaint, or post a speedy delete. or what? I'd appreciate any information you can provide. Thanks. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the information. Again, sorry to bother you about it - when I saw the comment, I wasn't concerned about you, but instead that perhaps some sort of action had been filed against me by the editor. What you've explained makes perfect sense. On a related note, I'd appreciate any input you might have as to how I handled things. From what I can see, the page was a pretty clear-cut redirect (or delete). It is about the Queen Charlotte Islands\/Haida Gwaii, for which there is already an article ([[Queen Charlotte Islands]]). It has some information about the Haida people, who are covered in detail in [[Haida]]. It has no references, is written in a non-encyclopedic manner, and closely parallels the information at the [http:\/\/www.purewest.com\/bluewater\/charlotte.html PureWest] and [http:\/\/www.bluewateradventures.ca\/destinations\/tripnotes\/queennotes.htm Blue Water Adventures] web sites. The editor in question ([[User:BCR123|BCR123]]) has also been cautioned by two different editors for adding inappropriate external links for a [http:\/\/www.islandsretreat.com QCI-based tourism company]. Thoughts? --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the reply. In this case, it wasn't a content dispute so much as a article fork, created and edited solely by the editor in question, that sprang up shortly after he\/she was reverted\/cautioned for adding spam links. I don't think it is AN\/I material... just a series of insults and insinuations. There comes a point where you get fed up with trying to be nice, and I'd prefer to ignore the editor rather than see the situation devolve. Thanks again. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the note. My changes weren't based on the U.K.-U.S. differences, but on the [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (titles)|style guide]] (and hence the changes were only to titles). In terms of titles, Wikipedia treats quotation marks as applying ''only'' to the title in question. All punctuation is kept outside of the quotation marks, and the same is true for italics as well. --'''
[Ckatz]: Unfortunately, that note isn't referenced either, and we cannot use Wikipedia pages to reference other Wikipedia pages. I've added a citation request to the ''Liar Liar\"" text. If one turns up, you can restore the text. --'''
[Ckatz]: As you've been told many times by several different editors, this is an international project and we have to write in a manner that reflects the audience. As for the warning, you are well aware that you changed the [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Smallville_%28TV_series%29&diff=prev&oldid=148626067 ''Smallville''] article once again, against the wishes of other editors and in an identical manner to your edits at [[Stargate SG-1]]. --'''
[Ckatz]: Please read through the [[WP:EL|external links]] guidelines - they will explain exactly why your link is being removed. If you feel that the SRTForums link is also unsuitable, please make your case on the article talk page. (As I've already explained there, I have no interest in the SRTForums link - if it is invalid as well, I'll remove it.) --'''
[Ckatz]: As well, an examination of the site (home page etc.) reveals that it appears to exist primarily to get viewers for advertising. (This is a subjective analysis,of course, but the home page boasts of \""anylizing reports\"" [sic] and information on the \""best looking girls\/boys in the world\"".) Sorry, but it just doesn't meet the guideline. --'''
[Ckatz]: As well, the ''lack'' of citations using \""language=English\"" would lead one to think that such usage is discouraged. Thoughts? --'''
[Ckatz]: Move completed. --'''
[Ckatz]: I've cleaned up the section to remove non-encyclopedic text and assertions. We'll see what the reaction is. --'''
[Ckatz]: I'm not interested, frankly, in a pointless war of words with you. However, I will say that it is very telling that you chose to respond to a disagreement over ''content'' with a carefully veiled ''personal'' jibe - that being the insinuation of vandalism on my part. I won't dwell on the insulting nature of your comment, other than to note that a) even the most cursory examination of my contribution history (and absence of blocks and warnings) would demonstrate that I spend an enormous percentage of my time on Wikipedia ''removing'' vandalism, and b) you obviously couldn't be bothered to make such an obvious, essential check of said records before hitting \""save\"". It is also interesting to point out that, according to your note on this page, my actions ''\""border on vandalism\""'' because I am ''\""very familiar\""'' with Wikipedia's policies. However, at the [[Talk:List of Farscape episodes#Upcoming Merge & Redirect per Wikipedia Guidelines & Notability Standards|''Farscape'' talk page]], you stated that I was ''\""unfamiliar\""'' with these same policies. Either I'm a really, really quick study (given that the messages are only three minutes apart) or else you're just saying whatever you feel like in order to try to justify your actions. Kind of sucks, really, and it is completely contrary to what this project is supposed to be about. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for asking. There's a long explanation\/discussion about the formatting at the ''Doctor Who'' project page. In a nutshell, Wikipedia convention is to use quotation marks for episode titles. The DW project, however, got into the habit of using italics instead, I think due to the fact that many titles refer to multi-episode serials rather than single episodes. The convention initially carried over to the new series, but more recently consensus was reached to move toward conforming with Wikipedia's guidelines. The new episodes were done first; I'm not sure what the plan is for the older ones. Hope this helps. --'''
[Ckatz]: There are several issues with regards to how you restructured the section. First off, there is no need whatsoever to separate \""former\"" and \""current\"" cast members. We treat the series as a whole, and the cast list reflects it as such. (Both of the examples you've used, ''Veronica Mars'' and ''X-Files'', avoid separate sections.) Similarly, your use of years isn't the most effective way of representing cast information, as a) viewers tend to think in terms of seasons rather than years, and b) the series is broadcast internationally, and Wikipedia itself is international. What North America sees as \""current\"" is not necessarily so for other regions. Personally, I have no problem with indicating when a character joined or left a series, but given the problems with your changes as a whole, the only viable option was a revert. Hope this answers your questions - please feel free to ask if you have more. --'''
[Ckatz]: Something simple, such as \""(season one)\"" or \""(season two, recurring in season one)\"" might be suitable. (FYI, I never presumed ''you'' were American; I was only referring to the fact that the series airs in ''North'' America ahead of many other parts of the world.) --'''
[Ckatz]: Alphabetical order, as per most other series articles. With your list, there was no easy way to find characters - some were alphabetical, others were grouped at the bottom. --'''
[Ckatz]: Useful feature, indeed. There is an \""undo\"" link in the page history - click it to have the option of undoing that edit. Alternatively, if you need to remove several edits in a row, use the \""diffs\"" option and undo that. (This works for edits by more than one editor.) Note that the edit will fail if there have been changes to the selected text in the meantime. For example, if Editor A vandalises a section, and Editor B edits a different section, you can undo Editor A. However, if Editor B makes a change to the same section of text, you can't undo Editor A's change. You could, however, undo Editors A ''and'' B if Editor C hasn't changed that section, and so on. This might not be the clearest explanation - please let me know if that is the case. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: I've had to remove the text again. While I appreciate the coincidence (and do find it interesting), the reality is that without some form of proof as to a connection, it is not considered to be encyclopedic. Are the game's creators ''Stargate'' fans? Perhaps - but computer games are released around this time anyways to meet the Christmas season. Are ''Stargate Atlantis'' producers fans of the game? Again, perhaps - but it is highly unlikely that they would alter the plot development of a season to match a game release date that could well change on short notice. However, if you feel strongly about it, please bring it up on the article's talk page. --'''
[Ckatz]: There are many bits of information about shows that do not qualify for inclusion. Countless bits of trivia are added on a daily basis across the television articles; some are deemed suitable for an encyclopedia article, while many others are removed. Does it mean the subject material isn't interesting? Not necessarily - just that it is not appropriate for Wikipedia. Take a look at the the articles for mature series - those such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[Doctor Who]]'', with strong Wikiprojects and hundreds of editors. Then, take a look at the articles for the newer, \""hit\"" series such as ''[[Heroes (TV series)|Heroes]]'' and ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]''. You'll see that they do not include week-to-week ratings information. Ratings, when included, are treated on a season-to-season basis. Hope this helps. --'''
[Ckatz]: No problem at all, and thanks for the note in return. I've restored your edit and added a request for a citation instead. (I saw the note you've pointed out at [[Julie Kavner]]. While it too is uncited, the attention to detail of the ''Simpsons'' Wikiproject is such that we can put out feelers for a reference rather than just removing it.) Thanks again for the contribution! --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks - that was added without discussion by an IP a few days back. It also shouldn't be there, and has been removed. --'''
[Ckatz]: There is a review process for television articles. THe preferred course of action, if article notability is questioned, is to redirect. Deletion is strongly discouraged. --'''
[Ckatz]: No problem - at the time, I wasn't aware the article had been merged. Thanks for the note. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... regarding the merge, the problem arose from a Wikipedia software upgrade that caused \""ref\"" tags being rendered as strings of numbers within the text of articles that were saved during a (roughly) 14 minute window. Unfortunately, your merge of \""Ted Sprague\"" occurred within that window and had to be reverted. Thanks for re-doing it. --'''
[Ckatz]: Sorry to say this, but I believe that you have misunderstood the actual events. If you'll refer to the edit history, it will reveal what really happened. [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Area_51&diff=173600788&oldid=173552101 This edit], by IP 84.197.122.26, deleted the \""Geography\"" section and replaced it with the racist material you described. Four minutes later, IP 71.11.128.83 [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Area_51&diff=next&oldid=173600788 reverted the vandalism], labelling it \""racism and spam\"". Your edit was done '''over two-and-one-half hours later''', and resulted in the second [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Area_51&diff=next&oldid=173601331 deletion of the entire \""Geography\"" section] (which at that point had no racist comments in it) with a thus-misleading edit description ''\""Deleted A Pointless & Stupid Racist Comment.\""'' ''That'' is what I reverted; '''an unexplained deletion by a low-edit IP account with an edit description that had no correlation with what was actually done'''. Given the inherent discrepancy between the comment and the action, and given that you were editing with an IP address, and given that it was the first edit from that IP address in almost two months, I feel my actions were entirely appropriate and justified. The only thing I can think of is that you saw the racist vandalism in the edit history, didn't realize that it had been removed, and thought you were removing it. Why you would delete an entire section, however, I cannot explain. I'm sorry that this happened to you, but I would respectfully state that it is ''you'', in fact, who should have checked the facts before making unsubstantiated and incorrect accusations against ''me''. --'''
[Ckatz]: The blog doesn't say this''is'' the season finale, it says that it is ''\""even more resolved and complete if, God forbid, the strike goes on so long that there is no more of season 2 than the first eleven.\""'' Beeman also says that they have every intention of producing more episodes for Season two if they are able to. (Sorry for the delay in responding - I was working on the rewrite.) --'''
[Ckatz]: Oh, I'm sure the debates will rage on endlessly. The confusion comes because of Kring's desire to make smaller \""volumes\"", or storylines. The ''season'' consists of an order of 23 episodes (season one) and 24 episodes (season two). However, this year, the ''volumes'' are shorter - last year's \""Genesis\"" ran for 23 episodes - all of season one - while \""Generations\"" was intended to run for 11 episodes and \""Villains\"" for 13 episodes, to make up season two. --'''
[Ckatz]: Sorry, but it's not \""disruptive\"" - I really don't think it is appropriate to archive the discussion at this time. The older material, yes, but not the more current material. (Sorry about the snow, too... if it makes you feel any better, the sun is partially obscured by some clouds right now.) --'''
[Ckatz]: By all means, have at it. I've already left you a note on your page... some of the material (as mentioned in my note) needs to go, as it is unencyclopaedic. FYI, I'm only removing text that isn't supported by the references provided, and cleaning up wording that is overly promotional. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: BTW, I did (of course) check the reference first. It is a college newspaper, and it says ''\""With its 2006 debut on NBC, Heroes hooked viewers with its \""save the cheerleader, save the world\"" mantra.\""'' That validates the use of mantra, but it does ''not'' support your assertion that ''\""In 2006, when Heroes debut on NBC, Save the Cheerleader, Save the World became a very popular mantra for the series\""''. That is why I worked the term \""mantra\"" into the line ''\""The series, along with its mantra \""save the cheerleader, save the world\"", has been referred to, featured and parodied in several other series...\""'' --'''
[Ckatz]: No problem, and I appreciate the note. I'm also trying to avoid an edit war, as that article has had enough battles in the past with \""DEYS\"". Accordingly, I've proposed what I feel is a possible solution at the talk page; please let me know what you think. Thanks again. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... for some reason, I had [[User:BayBoyBlues]] on my watchlist, so I noticed your post regarding the confusing usernames. FYI, I have filed a notice at the [[Wikipedia:Usernames for administrator attention]] message board regarding this. --'''
[Ckatz]: Ah, that was fast - the account has been blocked. If you have any future issues like this, you can file a request there (or feel free to ask me for assistance, if you like.) Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... thanks for the note. Hopefully, the [[WP:EL|guideline]] I supplied will help explain Wikipedia's approach to external links. However, I wasn't the one who removed your edit from the main article - that was done by someone else. I see you've restored it, which is fine as it seems valid. If, by chance, it is removed again, you may wish to bring it up on the talk page and explain why you feel it is warranted; that tends to be received better than simply reinserting. (By the way, with regards to ''\""how to carry on a conversation\""'' - you're doing just fine. Generally speaking, questions regarding article content go on the article's talk page, while questions regarding a specific editor's actions are best directed to that person's page.) Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: These are just some of the reasons for avoiding excessive lists. Yes, ''Lost'' may well have such lists, and I'm sure you could present other examples. That doesn't mean it is the best solution, however, and there are certainly examples of long-established, highly respected television articles that ''do not'' do this. (For example, ''[[The Simpsons]]'', which is generally regarded as an example of what we should strive for.) Thoughts? --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... thank you for the note, and for the offer of a nomination for adminship. As you've noted, I have been offered nominations in the past, but did not feel quite ready to accept at the time. However, I now feel more comfortable with accepting the responsibility. Would it be alright to think about it for a few days to be sure, and so that I can review the procedure? Thanks again. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the note; I'll re-run AWB when I get a chance. (IIRC, the changes from the scan were pretty minor.) I also took a look at the page, and the problems with the \""Reference\"" section seem to originate with the IP edits just following where you reverted to. The IPs removed a few brackets from the \""ref\"" and \""cite\"" coding that messed things up. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Fair enough... you've raised a valid point, and I did consider the whole \""removing a complaint about removing stuff\"" issue when making that change. Given the IP's limited contribution history, and the fact that the only contributions have been POV article text or forum-style talk page posts, I still think it was justified. However, I won't object if you wish to restore it. (Good to see you're still around, by the way!) --'''
[Ckatz]: A good suggestion... hmm... I saw that trick a short while back - I'll try to track down the coding. Thanks. --'''
[Ckatz]: Sorry for the delay. The links were repeatedly restored, despite cautions and notification that they were not suitable. (I've explained in more detail at your talk page.) --'''
[Ckatz]: Done. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... sorry to bother you, but I was just curious about the revert at [[Charlottetown]]. Anything in particular that was amiss with the reference regarding passenger volume? (No problem if I missed something, just let me know.) Cheers! --'''
[Ckatz]: Fair enough. Any thoughts about how we might rework the line to include \""we\"" and still make it a bit more formal? (Part of why I removed it was because I thought \""we know [[life]] exists\"" was a bit casual.) --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello again, and thanks for your patience. Yes, I would be happy (and appreciative) to accept the nomination. I would like to spend a few days reading through the admin. reading lists, to prepare for the process. Does that work for you? --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks very much, both for the nom and the kind words. I've accepted the nomination, completed the questionnaire and have transcluded the RfA. Thanks again. --'''
[Ckatz]: (''edit conflict'')Please stop restoring the links - they fail Wikipedia's [[WP:EL|guideline for external links]]. First off, the link you added to [[Spacewar!]] has no relation to the page, other than a similarity in name. The other two links don't add anything to the respective page, I'm sorry to say. That, really, is what we use as a standard, not \""equal access\"". (There are many, many, many space-related sites like yours that do not make the cut.) Beyond that, you have already been advised about the conflict of interest; as a principal in the company, you cannot be considered neutral when it comes to assessing the perceived value of your product. Please don't just keep restoring the links, as it will only result in a block of your IP, or worse, a spam-block of your domain. A more productive approach would be to try to seek consensus amongst editors that there is some merit to including a link to your site. Hope this helps. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... a question - what does one do when a SPA\/suspected sock puppet comments at an RfA? Should I even respond? I'm concerned that doing so might just be what the guy wants, but on the other hand I don't know if it is considered bad form to just ignore the comments. (I strongly suspect this is from the 143.*.*.* IP\/confirmed \""EverybodyHatesChris\"" sock who disagreed with my edits this afternoon.) Any guidance you can offer would be appreciated. Thanks... --'''
[Ckatz]: With all due respect, it is hardly fair to make such a statement just because I was not able to respond instantly. As to your tags, there was no need to add ''four'' additional templates to the section, especially with an edit comment such as ''\""Well, let's go all out then, shall we?\""'' Soulscanner had added the \""disputed\"" tag, to which you added \""cleanup-section\"", \""copyedit\"", \""repetition\"" and \""misleading\"". At the most, you should have added ''one'' tag - the \""cleanup-section\"" template. The others are repetitive; \""copyedit\"" and \""repetition\"" are already covered by \""cleanup\"", while \""misleading\"" is addressed through the existing \""disputed\"" tag. The edit war you and Soulscanner are involved in is disruptive enough, and I'm not favouring either side. The simple fact is that the extra templates did not help, so they were removed. --'''
[Ckatz]: The latter, to verify that they do it to attract US listeners. It seems plausible, as it could attract American advertising, but a cite seemed in order. Since you've removed the text it applied to, I'll remove the template. (By the way, thanks for the note (and the vote)) Cheers! --'''
[Ckatz]: Thank you very much... and thanks for the \""new admin school\"" tip. That will help with the learning curve. Cheers! --'''
[Ckatz]: Sorry, just missed this last night. I'll try to look over the article and give you some feedback. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: The links are not being used as references; they are being spammed across many pages, most recently by single-purpose IPs which appear to be in use by the same person or persons. Furthermore, this is not the first time this URL has been involved in questionable postings; problems date back to at least March of 2007, when [[User:Sportsint|Sportsint]] was repeatedly warned regarding spam. (It even appears that the URL was added to Wikipedia's spam filter for a period of time.) Wikipedia is not a collection of links; just because an interviews exists does not grant it the automatic right to be listed. --'''
[Ckatz]: Please read through the [[WP:EL|external links guideline]]; I would be happy to answer any questions you might have. However, please remember that you have been given final warnign regarding these links. --'''
[Ckatz]: Sorry, but we'll have to discuss this through the talk page as I'm not on a chat service. As for your concerns, I'm not sure how much more helpful one can get. I've explained the guideline regarding external links, I've given you a link to that page as well as to previous concerns regarding the URL, and I've held off on other measures despite repeated reverts.  --'''
[Ckatz]: Unfortunately, the remainder of my comment was cut off; a simple search in English found 1,800 hits on Boulaich. Obviously, not all will be useful, but several of the hits (book on Amazon, part of university-level course reading, etc.) are sufficient to establish that a speedy deletion is in fact inappropriate. Beyond that, I would ask that you assume good faith on the part of your fellow editors, and avoid making unwarranted <s>threats<\/s> suggestions that this action in any way warrants an AN\/I report. Note that the speedy deletion policy explicitly states that ''\""deletion is not required if a page meets these criteria\""'' and ''\""Any editor who is not the creator of a page may remove a speedy tag from it.\""'' Speedies are a ''request'' for deletion, not a directive. As an ''administrator'', I'm expected to assess your request, determine if it is warranted, and act accordingly. As an ''editor'', I'm entitled to disagree with your opinion. --'''
[Ckatz]: Out of respect for your reply, I've changed \""threat\"" to \""suggestion\"". However, that doesn't change my underlying concern that you would consider this as being even remotely worthy of an AN\/I report. Those are generally reserved for serious issues, not minor disagreements over content (which is what this is.) --'''
[Ckatz]: To quote another editor, ''\""The fact that there's a keep !vote here already indicates to me that it would have been inappropriate to speedily delete the article. Speedy deletion is only for those cases that are so obvious that there is no need to waste everyone's time with a debate.\""'' (This is from the [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\/Regina Freedman|deletion debate for Regina Freedman]]; while that article did end up being deleted, it is another instance where you took issue with an editor who disagreed with your use of CSD:A7.) Look, obviously, we're not in agreement on this matter; why not agree to disagree and put this behind us? --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the note. Unfortunately, the links don't meet [[WP:EL|the external links guideline]]. I've explained in greater detail [[User talk:198.182.9.42#External links|on your talk page]]. --'''
[Ckatz]: With all due respect, your links do not meet the requirements. However, we cannot disrupt the page over the links section, so I have followed standard practice as per the [[WP:EL|guideline]] and inserted a link to the Open Directory Project. The ODP is, to quote their site, ''\""the largest, most comprehensive human-edited directory of the Web.\""'' Wikipedia recommends the use of this search engine as a means of avoiding dispites over external links sections in articles. You are free to submit any and all links you wish to that site; the submission page is [http:\/\/www.dmoz.org\/add.html here]. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... thanks for the note. Well, the name popped up on the 'bot list, and did not come across as a serious attempt to create an acceptable ID. Factor in the nonsense article, and the soft-block seemed warranted. I won't object if you feel inclined to revert, however. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the note. Unfortunately, those articles were vandalized by [[User:Bnationalp]] ''and'' by that user's IP address; hence the complication when reverting. The user and the IP have been temporarily blocked; please let me know if you see more vandalism from either party. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: \""thesportsinterview\"" links have been repeatedly spammed across a series of articles for over a year now, and the URL was even on the spam list for a period of time. A host of single-purpose IPs have surfaced, their only goal being to add links to this site to articles. The external links guideline does not condone adding links just because an interview ''exists''; otherwise, we would have hundreds of links on these pages. You have been advised of this repeatedly; please respect the site guidelines. --'''
[Ckatz]: You are welcome to seek a second opinion, but to be perfectly honest you are in all likelihood going to get exactly the same response. Wikipedia does not exist as a directory for links; furthermore, the fact that your links were \""up for a year\"" does not indicate that they should have been placed to begin with. There are well over two million articles on Wikipedia, so it does take time to clean up problems. You are not the first site owner to question why his or her links are being removed; many, many people have done the same thing, because they do not see the difference between Wikipedia and other web sites. I've said this before, but I'll say it again: do not take it as a comment on your site, merely the reality that the links are not suitable for this project. --'''
[Ckatz]: I think we need to clarify another issue as well. Based on the conversations you've had today, I think that you may be under the wrong impression as to what Wikipedia is. This site is ''not'' a public forum, a search engine, or a directory service. The aim of the project is to build an online encyclopedia, one that \""anyone can edit\"". That involves several core principles that govern what sort of content is deemed acceptable; we have to ensure that text is [[WP:V|verifiable]], obtained from [[WP:RS|reliable sources]], [[WP:N|notable]], and so on. [[Wikipedia:Notability (organizations and companies)|Companies are not permitted to use Wikipedia for advertising purposes]], which is why an article about an organization is expected to avoid resembling that organization's promotional material. Related to this, web site owners are cautioned about [[WP:COI|contributing information that benefits their interests]], and [[WP:EL|external links to sites]] are not permitted just because (for example) an interview exists. There are millions of companies world-wide that will [[Wikipedia:FAQ\/Business|never be able to have Wikipedia articles]], not because they are bad or because Wikipedians dislike them, but instead because they do not demonstrate sufficient notability for inclusion. Think of it this way - you would expect your company to be permitted to have a listing in the phone directory, alongside CNN or the ''New York Times''. Would you, however, be offended if those organizations were written up in the ''Encyclopedia Brittanica'' and yours was not? --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... I see you've noticed this editor as well. Any thoughts as to what to do - the name is debatable, and the edits are hit-and-miss. (They also seem quite advanced for a brand-new account.) --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the feedback. Yes, the speed was one of the odd things; the self-congratulation on the user page was interesting as well. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Andrew, per the comments that have been left on your talk page, at least three editors other than myself have reviewed your site and felt that it did not meet the external links guideline. This doesn't mean your site is bad, but Wikipedia is not a links directory or a search engine. We don't link to ''every'' site with content. The project works on based on consensus, and the consensus so far has been that your links don't belong. Please see my note on your talk page as well. --'''
[Ckatz]: It is understandable that you would feel strongly about your site, and it is also commendable that you are trying to adapt it based on comments from others. However, one key problem lies in ''you'' being the one to add links to the site, since there is an obvious [[WP:COI|conflict of interest]]. You'd need to convince other editors that the site has something unique and distinct to offer, and let ''them'' be the ones to add the site. FYI, blogs and user-edited sites often have a more difficult go of it than other sites with stricter editorial oversight. As for the other links you mention, the general feeling here is that the existence of invalid links (again, using \""invalid\"" as a reflection of WP's links guideline rather than site quality) does not justify the addition of ''more'' links. If you feel some existing links aren't appropriate, you are encouraged to suggest they be removed. (Ordinarily, I'd say to remove them yourself, but again the \""conflict of interest\"" issue arises.) --'''
[Ckatz]: One point to consider: the message you're currently posting is too \""promotional\"" in nature, and may well cause additional problems. I would suggest you remove the old text and reword it to briefly describe the site and its features in simple, \""hype-free\"" text. Most importantly, '''be sure to mention your role''', the fact it was deemed unsuitable previously, and that you have reworked it on the basis of comments received here. That way, there is nothing \""hidden\"", you avoid the \""hey. look at this great site\"" spam messaging that is discouraged here, and you put everything out there for editors to assess. Again, you may or may not be successful, and it would probably be case-by-case. Hope this helps. --'''
[Ckatz]: Further to this, remember that on Wikipedia, an \""administrator\"" is just an editor with some extra tools to assist in enforcing policies and guidelines established by ''all'' editors. Your actions and the IP's actions contravened a long-established requirement for verifiability, and as such can (and should) be removed when discovered. While editors are encouraged to discuss the matter - as Bignole did by posting on the respective talk pages - it would be inappropriate to allow unreferenced material to remain until said discussion is complete. --'''
[Ckatz]: Done - I've restored the version immediately prior to the posting of the AfD notice. (There were no revisions after that point.) The only change I've made is to comment out the categories and the interwiki links. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Done. Thanks for letting me know. --'''
[Ckatz]: No problem - please let me know if this persists after the protection is released. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the note. I've found the \""DMOZ\"" link to be pretty useful so far... the ''Sliders'' page most definitely wasn't an \""issue\"" by any stretch, but there are other pages (in TV, cars, etc.) that have had real problems with external links. It seems to address several concerns, especially complaints along the lines of \""why isn't my site here if that one is\"", while still providing easy links to fan pages. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: There is still a need to provide proper references, and a check of the other pages shows that it wasn't referenced there either. Please try to provide some, as much of the article is unreferenced. --'''
[Ckatz]: The warnings to RP were a part of a larger issue, rather than any specifics about formatting. (Good to check, though, if you're aiming for FA - hope it goes well!) For your question, I would suggest going with 01 January 2001, and then applying [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)#Autoformatting and linking|wiki markup]] to the date as <nowiki>[[01 January]] [[2001]]<\/nowiki>. That will allow it to appear based on a user's preferences. Hope this helps. --'''
[Ckatz]: I'll take a look. It should be possible to split the history, but I'll have to double-check. Might take a while before I can get to it, but I will let you know either way. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hey, Michael, sorry to hear that you're leaving. I can relate to the time thing... hopefully, you'll be able to stick around in some capacity as it would be a real shame to lose you altogether. Best of luck, and hope to see you here again. --'''
[Ckatz]: By the way, what do you mean by \""stasis\"" - would you like your pages semi-protected against vandalism, or what? (Just let me know.) --'''
[Ckatz]: The section (not page) was removed initially because of questions over its notability. Keep in mind that while the game may have had a fair number of players, that does not necessarily mean it warrants inclusion. Given that the series is now over, you may find that a lot of material that is currently in the article (''Tom Tooman'', ''Beyond Jericho'', etc.) ends up being removed by the editors if there is no indication of lasting importance. However, I've left it in for now after cleaning it up a bit. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: No bother - and done. (I'd noticed the connection between the two as well. Thanks for keeping an eye on it.) --'''
[Ckatz]: Again, no problem - feel free to ask any time. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Wow... glad you caught that, as it certainly wasn't what was intended; I'd only meant to undo a spammed external link in that article and several others. Seems the utility I was using did something other than what it reported, so I'll review the other edits as well. Thanks for bringing it to my attention, and sorry for the inconvenience. --'''
[Ckatz]: With respect to the image, it is important to discuss a change of this nature ''first'' because there are several issues with regards to the replacement. The replacement images have been retouched (by a Wikipedia editor) and cropped, and were actually mislabelled in some instances as being \""Pluto and Charon\"". (According to the official source, the two discs are both Pluto.) Furthermore, this is ''not'' a question of using a \""prettier\"" image, as evidenced by the number of comments about the \""disco ball\"" ([[:Image:Pluto.jpg]]). Despite these complaints, we have used that image because it does better serve the \""encyclopedic purpose\"". The original is a ''more accurate'' representation of Pluto, being a true-colour image. --'''
[Ckatz]: This message is being left for both parties - please stop edit warring over the use of flags in the television template. This is a content dispute; reverting one another over and over is more detrimental to the project than the presence (or lack thereof) of an image. Both of you are in danger of violating the [[WP:3RR|three-revert guideline today; CJ2005B may already have done so. As well, to correct Islander, the template instructions are simply that - instructions for use. They do ''not'' mandate the use of a flag icon, nor should they be considered as being on the same level as an official guideline. --'''
[Ckatz]: The edit war being \""already over\"" (and Islander's being a sysop) aren't really relevant - the note was still valid. I'll emphasize, however, that it was just a note, not a warning or a template. If you've resolved it between yourselves, great, I was only trying to stop the back-and-forth on the page. However, since it has been brought up, I'm curious to ask Islander why he\/she (sorry) \""completely disagrees\"" with me. (I'm presuming it is in regards to the template-guideline comparison.) --'''
[Ckatz]: Ah, but guidelines do have a higher status (if you will) than template instructions, as a guideline must reach consensus to ''become'' a guideline. (The template documentation is just that - instructions on how to use the code - and does not have the same weight. (As well, the template instructions do not say one''must'' use a flag, or even that flags are recommended. They only give a link to where you can find flag templates.) --'''
[Ckatz]: It is in [http:\/\/www.inspection.gc.ca\/english\/fssa\/labeti\/guide\/ch11e.shtml Section 11.2], stated as ''\""Metric units must be used or, '''metric units and any other equivalent unit of measurement''', provided that the metric units are displayed more prominently.\""'' (The relevant text is in bold text for emphasis.) Hope this helps. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... yes, we've been tracking and reverting the same person\/link. However, [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Steveston%2C_British_Columbia&diff=213414263&oldid=213345684 the revert you're referring to] actually involved the URL www.steveston.bc.ca; the spammer (after having his\/her handiwork removed yet again) [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Steveston%2C_British_Columbia&diff=213343955&oldid=213343195 deleted that link] out of what I can only assume is spite. --'''

[Ckatz]: No problem, always happy to answer questions. Thanks for getting rid of today's spam, by the way. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... regarding your message, I appreciate your concern - but it would have been more appropriate to enquire as to the situation rather than just assuming the worst. I'm certainly not interested in edit warring, nor do I personally care about where the redirect goes. However, there was an established consensus as to where the redirect should go, and the page has been plagued with multiple changes since then (usually from newer editors who aren't aware of the consensus.) Part of an administrator's role is to ensure consensus reached through discussion is maintained, and that involves using our discretion to do so. In this case, it is clear that leaving the page redirected to the TV series will not achieve that goal. Accordingly, the best choice is to protect the consensus version. If you disagree, I'm happy to discuss it with you - and I do apologize if my edit summary wasn't clear as to my intentions. However, I still feel that there is no need whatsoever to suggest a \""misuse\"" of the admin bit when a thorough examination of the details clearly reveals it is not. --'''

[Ckatz]: Look, this really shouldn't be such a big deal. I can assure you that it is certainly not meant as any sort of comment on your move to protect the page. I'll revert myself if you wish, but I really think you should open a discussion on the matter - or at least make some sort of mention of it - on the talk page. Otherwise, the page remains locked, there's no clear explanation of why, and the regulars who have been working under consensus are left in the dark. --'''
[Ckatz]: In principle, the idea is interesting. However, the template itself is not designed for such a fine degree of directional input, nor is it appropriate given the constraints imposed by the typial Wikipedia page. (For example, while you've squeezed in the directions you did, there's not really any room to add their counterparts that require horizontal space.) This template is only intended to give an ''approximate'' indication of where other cities are. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... couple of questions for you. One, I noticed you restored the \""image\"" code. My thought on removing it was that it encourages use of images for decorative purposes, which is contrary to [[WP:FLAG]]. Second, I've reverted some other changes from earlier today which added fields for WNW, ENE, WSW, and ESE. I think they are a bit too fine a detail for this template, especially given that there's no room to add NNW etc. What do you think? --'''
[Ckatz]: The changes have been removed again, pending discussion. (I've asked the other editor who maintains the template to comment as well.) Again, the addition of the additional points is not necessary, and does not improve the template in its current form. In fact, it actually complicates the design, as it is nearly impossible to differentiate between the different positions given the coarse resolution possible with a text-based template system. (This is especially true with longer entries that tend to wrap.) If you still feel strongly about his, I would suggest you open a discussion on the template page to get input from other editors. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the note. However, the correct wording (per Wikipedia convention) is to retain the present tense. Creative works are considered to exist even after ceasing production. --'''
[Ckatz]: The link was removed because it does not meet the [[WP:EL|external links guideline]]. Ths is not a comment on the quality of your site, merely a reflection of the fact that Wikipedia is not intended to serve as a directory service. Hope this helps. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the note. Regarding the revert, keep in mind that it was a case of an anonymous IP editor whose only two edits were to 1) add speculative trivia, then 2) restore that trivia without explanation after it was removed. As for the information, it is non-notable trivia, as explained by the other editor who reverted your text. Hope this helps. --'''
[Ckatz]: I'm not sure what your question is. I'll presume that you are referring to the fact that your edits are listed under your IP address. That is because you have chosen to edit anonymously, without registering. All edits must be logged under the licence used for Wikipedia's content; if you prefer not to display your IP, just click on the \""Log in\/Create account\"" button. (Registering also allows you to have a personal talk page, create a watchlist for pages you've edited and\/or wish to follow, and so on.) Please feel free to ask if you have any questions about this. --'''
[Ckatz]: No problem - and thanks forleaving me a note so that I could correct my previous message. As mentioned, the issue is with adding promotional links. You may find the [[WP:EL|external links guideline]] helpful in understanding this; feel free to ask if you have any questions about it. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Per the release, ''\""The two known and named plutoids are Pluto and Eris. It is expected that more plutoids will be named as science progresses and new discoveries are made.\""'' The text further down about naming apears to be related to resolving the overlap with regards to naming objects between the IAU (planetary bodies and their satellites), the WGPSN (surface features) and the CSBN (small bodies except satellites of the major planets). I'm sure we'll eventually see Sedna et al declared as plutoids\/dwarf planets, but for now only two are official. --'''
[Ckatz]: It isn't a question of where they are from. The [[WP:MOS|Manual of Style]] - specifically, the[[WP:FLAG| section regarding use of flags]] - outlines how we are supposed to avoid the decorative use of images. --'''
[Ckatz]: Being (or not being) a \""scientific paper\"" has nothing to do with it. This is an encyclopedia, with a series of policies and guidelines developed under consensus. Please read through the Manual of Style and the [[WP:FLAG|guideline for use of flags]]. While you may find the use of the image esthetically pleasing, that does not make it acceptable under the site's rules. Neither does the presence elsewhere. Also, please stop reverting without discussion as that is not permitted either. --'''
[Ckatz]: That may or may not be the case, but disagreeing with site policies doesn't give you the right to ignore them. If you disagree, the proper method is to seek change of the guideline. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello, and thank you for the swift response. Tonight's vandalism was relatively minor in nature, being more of a nuisance factor. However, I did block for six months based on past history. Given your attention to the matter, however, I have now reduced that term to two months, and (as per your request) extended it to the second IP. Thank you again for taking a proactive approach to this matter. Please feel free to ask if you have nay questions about this. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: There are a number of issues with the graphic, and its placement. First off, we shouldn't be tinkering with the lead while the poll is under way. Secondly, the graphic itself is confusing and hard to interpret. There is no explanation of what the different axes represent, no qualification as to how the results are compiled, and no indication as to whether or not it is even relevant. Counting rollbacks is not a definitive measure of vandalism; rollbacks are often used as a speedy revert of other material, especially given that many users have scripts that allow proper edit comments when rolling back. Finally, I'm not sure why you feel it is appropriate to include this  graph when you were opposed to including the poll results. --'''
[Ckatz]: I could respond in so many ways to this... anger, over a '''nonsensical''' accusation of racial bias; frustration, given that you've obviously not read the [[WP:EL|external links guideline]]... Look, this isn't a link directory. If there are other sites that (as with yours) should not be there, let me know. Don't resort to making ridiculous, unfounded, confrontational, unfair, insensitive and meaningless accusations just because your nose is out of joint. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thing is, you have to provide a [[WP:RS|reliable source]] for the claim. Memory isn't good enough; it has to be something [[WP:V|verifiable]]. --'''
[Ckatz]: Reverting changes by an editor with a history of POV incidents is perfectly acceptable, and does not in any way limit my responsibilities as an admin. --'''
[Ckatz]: Simply put, they are not permitted under any circumstances; this isn't just a guideline, it is [[WP:NPA|policy]]. I'll take a look at the page. --'''
[Ckatz]: Already taken care of. --'''
[Ckatz]: The contributions, however, suggest the editor isn't serious. Seeing as how you're the target, though, I've no issues if you wish to adjust. --'''
[Ckatz]: Generally speaking, Wikipedia doesn't use spoiler tags, even in references. Hope this helps. --'''
[Ckatz]: Either way, it isn't a suitable contribution, and has been removed. --'''
[Ckatz]: No problem at all - thanks for your work as well. Sneaky vandals... --'''
[Ckatz]: It is important to note that there was no discussion of the page moves to begin with, nor any consensus to do so. (The first move was an undiscussed move by a newish editor who wanted to affirm the US dates.) As well, per [[WP:BOLD]], keep in mind that the second part of that guideline states ''\""...but be careful\""''. In the case of an established page with dozens (if not hundreds) of pages linking to it, it is better to initiate a move discussion ''first''. Yes, the episode list is under \""reimagined\"", but the older series is titled \""(1978 series)\"". I've no real preference, but I do feel that the proper way to do this is to discuss it first, so that there can be a) consensus and b) a coordinated effort to clean up all the loose ends afterwards. Thoughts? --'''
[Ckatz]: Read through [[Special:Contributions\/74.234.19.110|your edit summaries]]. They are clearly disruptive, clearly inappropriate, and you've been (clearly) warned. --'''
[Ckatz]: Actually, no, just had other things to do. First off, not all of your content is \""fine\"", as demonstrated by the fact that you have been reverted by several different editors. Second, there is a vast difference between an encyclopedia article on the ''word'' \""fuck\"" and your [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Tyers_River_railway_station%2C_Victoria&diff=prev&oldid=226361781 edit summary about a misplaced comma] saying <blockquote>''\""What kind of fucking IDIOT places a comma in a place like that? Jesus fucking Christ I could see a frigging semi-colon, but how far up your ass would you have to stick your head to find that comma?\""''<\/blockquote>Surely you can see the difference.--'''
[Ckatz]: The article does not meet the [[WP:N|notability requirements]] for inclusion. (Please note that this is not a reflection on the quality of the band.) You may wish to see if you can locate reviews, references, etc. to support an article. --'''
[Ckatz]: I've restored it to a sub-page of your user page; you can find it [[User:Waleran\/Hrvoje Banaj|here]]. Please feel free to ask if you have any questions about the article. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Done. Thanks for letting me know. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello, and welcome! Thanks for the contribution. It was, however, removed because of Wikipedia's [[WP:EL|external links guideline]]. (In a nutshell, this site isn't a directory service, so we usually only add links that supplement the information in an article, as opposed to providing links ''to'' search engines.) Don't let this deter you, though, as your participation is appreciated. --'''
[Ckatz]: Please don't make assumptions as to why I make certain edits. I would suggest that you  discuss your proposed changes in greater detail and seek consensus first, rather than the method you are currently using. [[Solar System]] is a well-established and featured article, one that has been through numerous reviews. Does that mean it is perfect, and should never be changed? Of course not - but it does indicate we should approach changes differently from the way we would for a developing article. --'''
[Ckatz]: Simply put, you tried something, I disagreed. This is not a case to be \""formally contested\""; instead, I would suggest you open a discussion on the article's talk page to see if anyone else supports your idea. --'''
[Ckatz]: Getting that way; I've just given notice on the talk page. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the note. After checking the contributions, it seems to match. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks - the never-ending string of socks continues. --'''
[Ckatz]: With all due respect, Tony, the onus is on you to seek site-wide consensus for a change largely championed and desired by you, rather than the article-by-article non-consensus method you are currently using. --'''
[Ckatz]: Sorry, but I'd prefer it if you didn't try to marginalize my concerns through the use of terms such as the unjustified \""hysterical\"" (here) and the offhand \""might have traction\"" (on your talk page, to myself and to another editor). I made an effort to explain my minor tweaks in the edit summaries, and have expanded upon that on the talk page. As for the DA, I have never said you were the only one pushing for optional status. I do, however, object to the way in which you are ''removing'' it without seeking a widespread consensus. That should definitely be discussed (and consensus reached) on a wider scale, not just in a conversation between us. --'''
[Ckatz]: Unfortunately, the text as written does ''not'' help toward that goal. It needs a rewrite, contains a lot of speculative material, and too much plot detail for the main article. While your efforts are certainly appreciated, in this case it would be better to discuss first. --'''
[Ckatz]: Please see my response on the article talk page. --'''
[Ckatz]: The partnership is described in the lead paragraph - complete with your reference. (Your text ''\""Executives from both companies expressed optimism...\""'' has been removed because it is not encyclopedic.) The lead also mentions, in the first sentence, that Scripped offers script registration and script coverage. --'''
[Ckatz]: As mentioned previously, what you need is to provide references that establish the [[WP:N|notability]] of the research. At present, we only establish that it is ''happening'' - not that it is notable. (Many companies fund research in areas they are involved in; that does not make the research encyclopedic.) --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for leaving a note. No worries about wheel-warring at all; I think you've done a good job in monitoring the discussion. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: There's no need for the aggressive tone here and in your edit summaries. My suggestion was merely to discuss the change *before* implementing it, not after. Simply put, many of the astronomy pages are high-traffic articles with relatively stable content; several have reached GA and FA status, so the general aim is to try to coordinate changes rather than just alter individual articles. --'''
[Ckatz]: FYI, the standard format for listing stars is alphabetical. Please don't just revert against this long-standing custom; if you do not agree with it, the better option is to open a discussion through the television project. Thanks. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the input; I certainly considered those points before issuing the block. However, HarryAffla has a long, long history of single-purpose editing on [[Solar System]], an equally long history of edit warring and ignoring input from others, and a habit of making inappropriate accusations against editors who disagree with him. While I have edited [[Solar System]] at length, I have made a point of avoiding this particular dispute as an ''editor'' (as HA has commented on at length) in order to remain impartial as an administrator. I've no objection, though, if you or anyone else wishes to review the matter, as I feel the contribution history for HA will more than justify the action. Thanks again. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hulu links aren't typically added, plus the content is often restricted to certain geographic regions, making it unsuitable. --'''
[Ckatz]: Re: the revert, fair enough. Thanks for the note, and let the discussions begin... --'''
[Ckatz]: Done, and thanks for the suggestion. Good to see you around, by the way. How was the trip? --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks, I'll try to review this tomorrow and give some feedback. However, it is probably best to present the ideas at the talk page, so that everyone can provide input. --'''
[Ckatz]: You need to provide verifiable references that support the text. [[WP:RS|This guideline on sourcing]] and [[WP:V|this one on verifiability]] may help explain what is needed. Please feel free to ask if you have more questions. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Please see your talk page; we sent messages at the same time. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... FYI, I'll need to revert your move to [[Template:Sp]], then move it to a new name in the \""Template\"" space, as that name was used earlier in a now-deleted template. If you could please suggest an alternate name - perhaps something that better indicates what the template is for - I can then make the move. Thanks. --'''
[Ckatz]: Sorry, but you are completely mistaken. Removing the \""Cheetah Girls\"" image is in no way whatsoever an \""administrative action\"", does not involve any administrative tools, and is based entirely on reading the [[WP:POINT|appropriate guideline]] and comments made by other editors at [[Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion\/2008 October 23#Section break 3|the Doctor Who image discussion]]. ''Any'' user, even including an anonymous IP, can make that edit. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... thanks for asking about this. The removal should not be taken as a comment on the NYMR in any way; apologies if my edit summary wasn't clear enough. Unfortunately, there has been an ongoing issue with spammed ITV links over the past year. This link was removed because it is one of many ITV links that were added en masse by single-purpose users and IPs tracing back to ITV itself. Please feel free to ask me if you have any other questions. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Likewise, no problem at all. In future, just remember to go to the admin first. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Please see the sources provided. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the note; I've trimmed the list, added a link to the Open Directory Project's \""horror\"" category, and cleaned it up. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: No problem. I've found that the Open Directory link (the template <nowiki>{{dmoz}}<\/nowiki>) can help resolve problem with excessive link build-up. It is Wikipedia-endorsed, and if editors want to add links, they can be directed to the ODP to submit the links there. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the note. The [[Open Directory Project]] is a volunteer project to create directories of Internet sites arranged by category. Given its volunteer nature, it has been deemed a suitable link for Wikipedia articles, and has become a useful tool in reducing excessive build-up of links. The template <nowiki>{{dmoz}}<\/nowiki> is used to provide a direct link to a category on the ODP; if editors want to add links to fan sites, they can be directed to the ODP to submit the links there. Hope this helps. --'''
[Ckatz]: Not a source, in the reference sense, but it is a organized directory of links. URLs are submitted to the volunteers for possible inclusion, and (if accepted) are added to one or more categories. DMOZ is considered a preferred alternative to a long list of links in an article. --'''
[Ckatz]: Tony, you know full well it is perfectly relevant to the discussion. Furthermore, it clearly indicates the time at which it was added, and there is also a mention in \""meta-discussion\"" for, well, discussion. Finally, I might add that you did not extend the courtesy of notifying anyone about your RfC to begin with - despite its overlap with one that was already under development - so you can hardly complain about what is \""appropriate\"". --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... unfortunately, your edits have had to be reverted again. The character of Daphne in ''Heroes'' does not warrant an article at present; all efforts to create one have only contained plot, whereas an article on a minor character would need significant real-world information to justify it. --'''
[Ckatz]: Useful information might include comments from the producers on the role, casting notes as to who was considered for the part, long-term influence of the character on the main characters, and so on. Again, though, this would all have to be sourced. --'''
[Ckatz]: --'''
[Ckatz]: Greg, I'm uncertain as to how there could be any confusion leading to the AN post, given that I told you point-blank that I had not contacted anyone when we discussed this two days ago. However, I do appreciate the retraction here and at the AN board. In the spirit of putting this behind us, I have tweaked my post at AN accordingly, and am willing to consider this closed if you are. --'''
[Ckatz]: Wikipedia also doesn't cover those sort of errors; virtually every film ever made has them, and they are really just a form of trivia. Generally speaking, we only note details such as those when someone else has made a note of it, such as if a film critic takes the producers to task for sloppy errors. --'''
[Ckatz]: They are interesting, for sure, but unfortunately they are not notable in the context of an \""encyclopaedic\"" treatment of the subject. (That is why I've had to remove it from the ''Iron Man'' film article as well.) Now, again, if some of these become notable through observations of third-party sources, they would then be suitable for inclusion. For example, there may be an Army official who comments on the errors in the war scenes. Alternatively, the producers might note (on a DVD commentary or similar medium) that they purposefully changed some aspect in order to achieve a certain dramatic effect. That would help to give the article a greater \""real-world\"" context.  Hope this helps; if I ever come across such observations, I'd be happy to pass them along to you. --'''
[Ckatz]: Stifle, with regards to this site, I've been reviewing the user's contribution history, the site itself, and the quality of online references to the site. I'm not sure that we need to remove this one from the blacklist, as the article appears to be purely for promotional purposes. Thoughts? --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the note (and for taking care of the notice) - both are appreciated. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the note (and for taking care of the notice) - both are appreciated. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the note (and for taking care of the notice) - both are appreciated. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for reposting this; I forgot to extend the archive time limit before the break. I'll try to take a look at the template over the next few days as I catch up on stuff. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for reposting this; I forgot to extend the archive time limit before the break. I'll try to take a look at the template over the next few days as I catch up on stuff. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for reposting this; I forgot to extend the archive time limit before the break. I'll try to take a look at the template over the next few days as I catch up on stuff. --'''
[Ckatz]: \""Quackety-quack\"", indeed... --'''
[Ckatz]: \""Quackety-quack\"", indeed... --'''
[Ckatz]: \""Quackety-quack\"", indeed... --'''
[Ckatz]: It's really more of an interface tweak than an editing tool; the \""editing\"" gadgets are special-purpose tools such as Twinkle and WikEd that offer a lot of features. Not a big deal, of course, but it seems a better fit where it is now. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the feedback. From what I could determine in past discussions about the ''Mail'', it is considered to be semi-reliable - not \""tabloidish\"", but also not entirely trustworthy when it comes to tabloid-style details about personal details. Given the vagueness of the text, it seems best not to use the information without a second source to verify. Thoughts? --'''
[Ckatz]: As it turns out, your IP address (76.77.66.130) resolves back to Insight, so I'll take that as proof that you are connected to the company. The image in question - [[:File:Safety Glass 2009.jpg]] - was uploaded on or around January 18th by [[User:Torigo]], who listed the source as the website <nowiki>kinopoisk.ru<\/nowiki>. If it is not publicly available, it would probably fail our requirements for \""fair use\"" and can thus be removed from the site if you wish. Please let me know and I will look into this matter further. --'''
[Ckatz]: As per the edit comment in the article text, and per the [[WP:EL|external links guideline]], ''\""Only add web sites for radio stations that do not have existing Wikipedia articles\""''. The stations that have Wikipedia articles already have those links in the respective articles; as we are not a directory service, we do not repeat the links in the list article. Hope this helps. --'''
[Ckatz]: Please read through the talk page archives, as it will help to explain this common misunderstanding. \""Main character\"" status is decided by the network and the series producer, ''not'' by the opinions of fans or Wikipedia editors. The roles of Sylar and Ando were not considered \""main\"" roles in the first season, but both actors were promoted to that status in the second season. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... FYI, I would advise you to self-revert your recent edit, as it places you beyond the [[WP:3RR|three-revert rule]] guideline. The IP is obviously not going to stop; I'm going to file a notice at [[WP:ANI]]. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Ben, thanks for your note. I would be curious to know who you emailed, as there is no \""head of music\"" at Wikipedia. (The entire site is run as a collaborative effort.) Beyond that, the external links guideline generally suggests that we do not link to sites just because they mention a particular subject; there must be a specific benefit to the article. Many, many websites publish reviews, but that does not mean that ''every'' review site should be listed. Is there any particular reason why you feel \""Sun on the Sand\"" is especially notable? (Keep in mind that this is ''not'' a comment on the quality of the site, only a question as to why it should be one of the few that do get listed.) --'''
[Ckatz]: Done - thanks for sorting that out! Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Reverted; unfortunately this is a tough one to stop as the IP changes so frequently. Thanks. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the note... I've cleaned up the unnecessary ones, and also left a note for the editor. --'''
[Ckatz]: Fair enough, and your efforts are certainly appreciated. I have as requested posted an AfD, and added a note outlining your efforts and your interest in seeking input. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks. Good work on sourcing more material to support the article. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello, and thanks for the note. Unfortunately, what you have to remember is that Wikipedia is not a site for introducing products, or for any sort of promotional campaigns. In order to qualify for an article, a product has to demonstrate notability independently of the mere fact it exists. If you have any reviews from suitable sources (PC World, IGN etc.) that can support the product as being distinct or exceptional, that would help. --'''
[Ckatz]: I've repeatedly asked you to explain why you feel it is necessary to add that detail ''twice'' within close proximity. While we disagree on its validity in the RfC, I at least compromised and left one instance. I would ask the same courtesy in return. --'''
[Ckatz]: Actually, if you look at other pages, the standard is ''not'' to list individual schools as you did. I have expanded the section, but the individual schools are adequately listed on the linked \""North Vancouver School District\"" article. --'''
[Ckatz]: Fair enough. However, can you provide a reference that supports your assertion that L&O guest stars are primarily from that world, as opposed to the broader one? (That would alleviate my concerns.) --'''
[Ckatz]: Sorry, I wasn't clear enough. Do you have anything to verify that, of the L&O guests who have a theatrical background, most are from \""legitimate theatre\""? Otherwise, there is no reason to use the more specific term as opposed to the more inclusive \""theatre\"". --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for looking into that. I'll keep an eye on them as well. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for your question. The note was not regarding the information you added to that particular article, where you used the interview as a reference. It was about the other seven links you added to various \""External links\"" sections, which did not meet the [[WP:EL|guideline]]. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the follow-up. With regards to the Vancouver page, in the absence of any references I'm presuming that it just spread from one page to the next until noticed. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Please note that the change occurred prior to the discussion, not after it. As well, it is the other articles that are out of line with the wider convention across television articles. I have provided several links that explain this. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks, I was wondering what was happening there. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the notice. I'm off-line until Sunday night, so I suppose I'll see it then. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Shaheenjim, the edit is obviously disputed, given that more people have objected to it (and removed it) than have supported inclusion. As such, per any number of Wiki quidelines, the onus is on you to ''achieve'' consensus *first* rather than to restore the material without consensus. --'''
[Ckatz]: Umm, would you care to explain how ''I'' am edit warring? Last time I checked [[Moon]]'s history, you are the one who has repeatedly restored your text without consensus to do so, given that three editors (myself, PhySusie, and most recently Rracecarr) have objected to it this morning alone. --'''
[Ckatz]: I've been quite clear about the need for more discussion on this text, which is a valid reason for removing material; I've been equally clear in ''moving'' it to the talk page, rather than just \""deleting\"" it as you claim. Given the objections of others to your restoration of the material in its present form, that seems the appropriate course of action. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the note. Sorry too - I thought I ''had'' left you a note, but it seems I didn't. Must have been the late hour! Thanks again. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the note. The text doesn't seem necessary for the main articles about these provinces and states. (I think a couple of other editors have also removed it or moved it to the talk page in some cases.) I've only removed it from the more general articles; it seems better suited to the ones I left, such as those on the lakes themselves and on tourism. --'''
[Ckatz]: Oops, removed one from a \""Lake\"" article; I've restored that. --'''
[Ckatz]: No, not spam for sure. However, I'd suggest giving editors a chance to respond at the talk page where another editor moved the text... it was one of the US states if I recall correctly. As for the idea of providing tourism information, there is a difference between tourism and encyclopedic content. Believe me, I can understand the importance of the Lakes to the local states and provinces... after all, British Columbia's tourism industry is one of its top employers. However, the main article ([[British Columbia]])doesn't list the tourism routes. --'''
[Ckatz]: FYI, with regards to this site, there have been a series of [[WP:SPA|single-purpose accounts]] created exclusively to add links to it. At this point, it should be considered spam unless you see some value to it. Thanks. --'''
[Ckatz]: As I said, the material (all text, not just an EL) was removed because it did not seem necessary for the main article. It is better suited to a sub-article instead. As well, other editors have questioned the appropriateness of the text for similar reasons; SandyGeorgia removed it from the [[Minnesota]] article, to which someone else commented : ''\""It was out of place in Geography, unneeded for a high-level, overview article like this, and the target article is completely undeveloped. It was properly removed; thanks.\""'' Look, the information is useful - just not everywhere that you placed it. I would think that it is best suited to the articles on the Lakes and the Saint Lawrence River, which is why I didn't remove it from those articles. --'''
[Ckatz]: Your spurious accusations of \""vandalism\"" to the contrary, the links do not appear to meet the requirements Wikipedia outlines in the various guidelines covering sources and links. As well, much if not all of the text removed appeared to serve little purpose other than as a rationale for including a link to your sites. As for the links, they again did not appear to meet the requirements. --'''
[Ckatz]: Ryan has stated that he does not want threaded comments in the for\/against areas; hence his cleanup earlier today. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks, I appreciate it - fixed things right up. (Not sure what happened, as the header is generated by the 'bot.) --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks - I've always wondered how to do that. --'''
[Ckatz]: The difference here is that this is a ''British Columbia'' template, not just a Vancouver one. (Even if it were just Vancouver, there's a big difference between Detroit Windsor and Vancouver\/Bellingham.) There are some other reasons; I'll add more later (ASAP) to better explain, but have to go offline for a short while (sorry). --'''
[Ckatz]: Hey, thanks for the offer. From what I've just read, there seems to be a dispute as to how to number the individual stories, and whether the \""Shada\"" story should be counted. The consensus ''appears'' to be with the existing numbering, given that a similar renumbering by an IP was reverted a short time ago. We'll see what happens after the editor reaches the end of the list; if her restarts, some other action may be required. --'''
[Ckatz]: FYI, I have reverted your last edits to the RfC. You may not have realized this, but the poll was closed and the page was edit protected. I'm not sure if you want to repost your comment to the talk page; I didn't want to just do so without checking with you first. --'''
[Ckatz]: Sorry if I wasn't clear... the poll was already closed, so the comments ''can't'' be added to the page. By \""repost\"", I meant posting them on the associated talk page (or the poll's talk page). Once the poll was closed and protected, no-one can add to it, even if the admin bit allows us access. --'''
[Ckatz]: Walter, that's not it at all... there had not been any discussion since March 27, and there was no apparent consensus to merge. Perhaps Cmjc80 should have requested outside advice, but the fact that he closed it after 17 days of inactivity is not comparable to your stated intent to \""close merger discussions that I feel are not going the way I like\"". --'''
[Ckatz]: Fasach Nua, you know full well that the images were not ''added''; instead, they were restored from deletions by ''you'', all of which were without any form of explanation whatsoever. (One of your edits even broke the formatting for an article's infobox, an error that you did not correct when you reverted me.) Again, as per what I and others have told you repeatedly, you would probably find that your concerns receive a more positive response if you took the time to engage in discussion, rather than just deleting without even explaining why you are doing so. --'''
[Ckatz]: Please do not misrepresent the situation. You deleted material, you did not explain why, you did not provide an edit summary, and you refuse to participate in any form of discussion about the deletions. FN, I'm presuming that your intentions are good. However, you must keep in mind that the behaviour I've described above - if taken by an IP or an editor without a good track record - would be considered vandalism. Please reconsider your refusal to explain your edits; I am certainly not the only editor to take issue with this problem. --'''
[Ckatz]: You may wish to review my previous post; that is where I specifically stated ''\""FN, I'm presuming that your intentions are good.\""'' --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... you asked about this a while back, and I replied on the dates talk page, asking if people wanted the section unprotected. (The section was isolated and protected when consensus was reached to unlock everything ''except'' for that section.) Following the request, there was no consensus to ''unlock'' the section, especially while the arbitration case is still under way. Hope this helps. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the note. Unfortunately, you need to supply a citation from a reliable source that indicates there actually is a controversy ovewr this. WE can't publish opinions. Please feel free to ask if you need more information about this. Thanks again. --'''
[Ckatz]: Being \""possibly the only dissenting viewpoint at the time\"" does not make the site or its opinion notable. --'''
[Ckatz]: It's not, and thank you for pointing it out. Per our [[WP:EL|guideline for external links]], Wikipedia is not a directory service. Please note that this should in no way be interpreted as a comment on the quality of either your web site or your competitor's. Simply put, it is a reflection of the consensus reached regarding what sites should and should not be listed. Thanks again. --'''
[Ckatz]: Locke, I'm undoing ''your'' action and asking you to please stay out of it. If there is a problem either way, you are best off allowing the clerks to handle it - that is their job after all. They will either revert HWV258's actions, or remove Pmanderson's comments. I mean you no disrespect, but there really is no need for you to intervene (and it would be best given the tensions that are prevalent if you did not). --'''
[Ckatz]: I'm not assessing either HMV258 or Pmanderson's actions, as that is the clerk's domain. Neither am I interested in taking sides. However, in this situation, you are clearly a third party intervening where you should not. There is enough drama on the pages associated with this matter; please let the clerks do their job, without muddying the waters. --'''
[Ckatz]: I don't feel comfortable removing the proposals, given that it is an ArbCom page. However, I have left a comment stating that I feel it ''should'' be removed. Hope this helps. --'''
[Ckatz]: No harm done. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Found [[User:B_ngwarrior]] in the \""new user\"" log... safe bet that this is yet another \""fan\"". The account is now blocked, but I thought I'd leave you a note in case it (by some unrealistically small chance) is valid. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hammersoft, I appreciate your taking the time to reply, and I have reviewed the above cases. One thing that became immediately clear is that this block is '''in no way whatsoever''' even remotely similar to the incidents you have referenced. Those cases involved editors (admins) who had been, and remained, directly involved in the articles in question. They had participated in the pages, they were content contributors, and they used their bit to their advantage. The \""Wolf426\"" IP issue here involves the reversal of the repeated deletion of properly referenced material by a single-purpose IP editor. I had no part in the original posting of that material, I had not contributed content to the article, and I had no prior involvement with the IP. My only prior edits to the page involved a few minor style guide issues, so to say I was an \""active\"" editor on the page or that I \""frequented\"" the page is completely incorrect. There is no parallel here at all - as supported by the comments at the AN\/I review, wherein at least two other admins have stated that my actions were appropriate given the IP's actions. I could understand your point if I had actually contributed any content to the article, or been a part of the creation process there - but I was not. Again, I appreciate your input, but we will have to agree to disagree with regards to your assertions. --'''
[Ckatz]: No problem - the rationale is that we generally avoid \""crystal-ball\"" type categories and tags. The series may be ''scheduled'' to go into the 2010s, and it probably ''will'' do that, but until it actually happens... For the same reason, we don't update episode counts until a new episode actually airs, and we list series as \""present\"" rather than a future, scheduled end date. Hope this helps. --'''
[Ckatz]: Anyhow, not sure it was a \""major edit\"", as I was really just trimming and rearranging to pass the time after reverting the spam link. However, since you brought it up, the express details probably aren't needed there either; the article was\/still is a bit heavy on minute details that are probably better left to either a comparison table or the software's FAQ pages. (Any thoughts on [[Google Notebook]], seeing as how I was there as well?) Thanks in advance. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... thanks for your input, and I do appreciate your concerns. However, I do have to take issue with certain aspects of what you wrote, given that I believe they do not accurately represent the event in question. I, too, am uninvolved in the articles in question, other than noticing and reverting an IP identified '''by another admin''' (Hiberniantears) as a likely sock of a previously blocked editor. The move to protect the page against a disruptive IP's actions was following an identical move by Hiberniantears, so I do not know why I was singled out in this case. Anyway, to reiterate, I do think that your reverts were in error (sorry to say) and that the situation should have been investigated in greater detail before you simply reverted two other admins. Just my two cents, though. --'''

[Ckatz]: Again, we'll have to agree to disagree. Looking at the matter as an outsider, I felt that the merge seemd appropriate, and that the IP's actions were disruptive. This is demonstrated by the fact that the IP is repeatedly restoring an external link that does not seem appropriate per [[WP:EL]], within hours of when you unprotected the page. The edit summary said \""per discussion\"", yet no discussion endorsed such a move, mirroring similar arguments by this IP at [[Micronations]]. Thoughts? --'''

[Ckatz]: Or, one could see it as a single-purpose editor (based on contributions, and whom another admin has suggested is an IP sock) who is unhappy with the removal of something he or she wants in, and is trying to get their way. Methods include multiple reverts, misleading statements, and discounting solutions (such as DMOZ) that have long been accepted as practical alternatives for EL-related issues.

[Ckatz]: Further to this, I find the IP's criticism of DMOZ (''\""DMOZ is very limited resource that links to a handful of websites.\""'') questionable, especially given that the DMOZ page offers 137 links categorized by region and other subject areas. Given that anyone is free to request that links are added to DMOZ (negating the \""out of date\"" claim), it would appear that the  primary reason for the IP's claim is simply that DMOZ doesn't list ''his'' preferred site. The DMOZ link does far more to assist providing a broader perspective that a solitary link to one site, and the IP is far better off submitting it to DMOZ than persisting in disruptive behaviour here. Just my two cents. --'''

[Ckatz]: I've been monitoring Commons, and it appears the file attribution has now been adjusted to allay his\/her concerns. That would seem to address the issue. --'''
[Ckatz]: The error lies in referring to the line as being two lines, and in describing it as the \""third and fourth lines\"" in the area. All Translink information describes the Canada Line as a singular line, and it is not up to us to reinterpret it as \""two lines\"". Furthermore, your description in the lead incorrectly gave the impression that there were two distinct lines totalling 30.2 km of track. --'''
[Ckatz]: Any revised wording would still have to reflect the \""one line\"" concept, as that is how the line will be described (and though of) by the public. Translink is (in all likelihood) going to be describing runs as \""Canada Line to Richmond-Brighouse\"" and \""Canada Line to YVR-Airport\"", as this would mirror what they do with the other lines. I have reworked the lead to reflect the main\/branch\/length issues. --'''
[Ckatz]: The previous version was structured better. If you wish to mention the arcs, I would suggest integrating them into the existing season-by-season format and trimming that down. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... thanks for the note. Unfortunately, I didn't have the time to finish earlier, and I suspect you may not prefer the rewrite that I've since done. The reality is that we are obligated to include what is said about the film, even if it is negative, as this is an encyclopedia article. I understand that it may be difficult for the cast and crew, but that is what what is required by Wikipedia's policies of neutrality. Please feel free to ask if you have any questions about this. --'''
[Ckatz]: Abel, the concerns I expressed about your edits are based on your previous posts, where you have indicated a desire to avoid the negative press. As for the article, we ''cannot'' ignore what has been said about the film. If it were only one bad review in a sea of praise, perhaps - but look at the comments from the major press that we didn't use:<blockquote>''\""About as cruddy as a cruddy little indie can get, especially given a cast that should've known better. \""'' (''Chicago Tribune'')<\/blockquote><blockquote>''\""[Director] Glatzer aims to wring laughter out of this desperation but succeeds only in producing a series of contrived characters and situations that make The Breakfast Club look like an unfiltered documentary.\""'' (''LA Times'')<\/blockquote><blockquote>''\""An unusually subdued Coogan does his best, but this is the kind of pretentious nonsense he usually satirizes.\""'' (''New York Daily News'')<\/blockquote><blockquote>''\""Mr. Coogan doesn't seem altogether comfortable with his part, which, like the story, undergoes a number of unconvincing changes.\""'' (''New York Times'')<\/blockquote><blockquote>''\""Without a trace of tempo or one shred of narrative pacing, What Goes Up is not really a movie; it's the cheapest kind of amateurishness that looks like it was shot with a cell phone. \""'' (''New York Observer'')<\/blockquote>Obviously, we're not here to trash a film - but we also cannot selectively pick-and-choose reviews that only cast it in a positive light. As such, I ''strongly'' encourage you to discuss future changes on the article's talk page instead of simply reverting. Otherwise, we run the risk of this devolving into an edit war. If you remain unconvinced as to the role Wikipedia plays in  covering material, we can certainly seek additional input regarding the article. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the note. I noticed that, but given that the micronation was more popular in terms of Google hits, the fact that the hatnote was an aside from someone opposed to even ''having'' the micronation article, and that the house doesn't appear especially notable outside of the US (at least, as compared to the micronation) the present arrangement seemed best. Thoughts? --'''
[Ckatz]: You're welcome to disagree, of course, but I felt it was ''equally'' fair to correct what appeared to be an improper decision to move the micronation article and replace it with one about a building. The correct procedure would have been to move the micronation article as done, create [[Wirtland (building)]], and use [[Wirtland]] as a disambiguation page for those two articles. I've proposed just such a move at the move discussion you opened. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the note; I've cleaned up the page per your request. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Blocked, edits removed, and I've asked for the URLs to be added to the blacklist at Meta. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: I was wondering if it was a straight revert, given the wide range of changes (many of which did not fit the edit summary). Good work on tracking down the older version. Given what you've said, is there any point in me sifting through the changes, or should I just leave it for the page regulars? --'''
[Ckatz]: I've replied on your talk page, but in a nutshell, you have to stop adding the link. As the site owner, you are in a conflict of interest - and as an editor here, you are not following the consensus process. Two separate editors have disagreed with your link, yet you continue to restore it, which is a real problem. You are far better off offering your knowledge on the talk page where it can be properly assessed. --'''
[Ckatz]: As mentioned, there are issues with the writing style, the organization, and other aspects. The lead paragraph was much stronger in its previous incarnation, whereas the revised one appears somewhat unfocused. I've just come online for today, and will be able to actually sit down and give an in-depth read-through later on. --'''
[Ckatz]: With all due respect, I have briefly expressed my concerns; as well, it does take a certain period of uninterrupted time to review and note the full extent of the issues. Apologies if it is not fast enough, but I've a lot on my plate right now. However, I will say that - while your efforts are certainly appreciated - I do feel that the rewrite has sufficient issues with it that we are better off keeping the original in place and ''adapting'' parts of the rewrite, rather than the other way around. I won't be able to give it a solid read for a few days yet, but if that doesn't work for you than I can assist in calling for a third opinion. (Probably the best bet is to post at the Television project talk page, given that ''X-Files '' has been out of production for a while.) --'''
[Ckatz]: The pages were compared, and the immediate impression was that the old one was better off as the \""current\"" version, to be used as a base. The revised lead was very problematic, and some of the reordering also appeared to be that way. There were also quite a few references that were removed as \""dead links\"", whereas the usual practise is to ''tag'' them as dead links while retaining the information. --'''
[Ckatz]: RT and Metacritic have established notability as aggregate review sites, and as such are considered to add value to article content from that perspective. Simply put, Wikipedia benefits more from the use than the site does. The case is reversed for individual sites that have ''not'' established notability independently, as they receive far more of a boost from being mentioned here than Wikipedia's articles do by including their content. While I can understand your concern at having your site rejected in favour of a competitor's (although the roles are somewhat different), you have to remember that we are not looking at it from the same perspective. --'''
[Ckatz]: Sorry for the delay in responding, as I've been off-line for a few weeks. (I've also replied to this matter at [[User talk:Kingwarren]].) Please note that your claims that this is related to any sort of \""personal problem\"" with you are completely unfounded, and that I did not actually block your account. I did, however, notice an apparent similarity between the various accounts involved, especially given the focus on specific content and the timing, and as such I requested a standard check to get an opinion from the editors who specialize in that aspect of Wikipedia's operations. This is a straightforward process that is requested frequently when situations such as this arise. It is important to remember that the decision is based on their independent assessment of your contributions, ''not'' simply because I raised the question. If you wish to take issue with their conclusions, you'll need to take it up with them. --'''
[Ckatz]: Sorry, didn't see that note. I'll take a look at the page. Cheers, and thanks for following up on this. --'''
[Ckatz]: If there's consensus regarding the format, it shouldn't be a problem if people wish to restore the previous version (essentially, undoing the changes). --'''
[Ckatz]: Now ''that'' is great service. Thanks for addressing this so quickly. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: You are incorrect in presuming that \""there for some time\"" equates to a right to be there. The links fail the \""what not to include\"" section, and are not necessary given the presence of professional sources. --'''
[Ckatz]: Sigh... --'''
[Ckatz]: Please note the supposed \""vandalism\"" consisted of removing a single link repeatedly spammed by rolling IPs that are likely connected to the site.

[Ckatz]: The fact that MGM is broadcasting repeats of its own production is not notable; in fact, one would ''expect'' them to do so. (It would only be notable if they were producing new episodes that were first broadcast on This TV.) Keep in mind that the series is in syndication on ''many'' networks, and Wikipedia is not a television guide. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the note; he seems to have left the most recent one in place. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: In short, the post is being reverted because it does not meet Wikipedia's Manual of Style, and introduces excessive detail and trivia into the article. I'll try to add some links for you to read later this evening. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hey, thanks for the note. No problem at all - I've done that before as well. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Ah, sorry - thought I'd commented on that. The planet (etc.) articles don't use astrological symbols in that manner, so they were reverted from the lead sentence. Sorry for the inconvenience. --'''
[Ckatz]: Again, we are not a directory service. Many quality sites do not have links, specifically because we try to avoid giving preferential treatment. Keep in mind that this is not a knock against your particular site, but instead a reflection of the established consensus with regards to links, which we try to keep to a minimum. Furthermore, there are several issues that complicate this, most notably that you have repeatedly ''restored'' the links without seeking consensus to do so, and that you are adding the links despite having a direct conflict of interest in doing so. Given your relationship with the site, you cannot add links to it, and would have to convince other editors of the site's merits in order to see if they feel it warrants inclusion. --'''
[Ckatz]: The text benefits the companies you've listed, but not the article. I think you'd be hard-pressed to argue that Pickled Productions is anywhere near comparable to Apple, Fox, and Chase Bank. --'''
[Ckatz]: This comes up every so often; sourced or not, the convention is that we only update season and episode counts in the infobox ''after an episode airs''. (The \""sourced' bit you've mentioned is more relevant to series such as ''Firefly'', which was cancelled before all of the episodes aired. In that case, the sources justify listing more than what actually aired.) --'''
[Ckatz]: No, we would put \""1\"" (or \""2\"", however many air). The following week, \""3\"", and so on. Look, I understand your confusion as the doc isn't too clear, but the established convention as used on all series articles is that we update only based on aired episodes. That is why changes prior to air are reverted immediately, as there are too many variables that can affect a scheduled airdate. Will it air at that day and time? Realistically, of courcse. However, we have no way of knowing if an unexpected event (natural or man-made) will occur and disrupt scheduling, so we wait. --'''
[Ckatz]: Listen, I don't know how many times I have to say this: '''what you are proposing is contrary to the established practice for the infobox'''. If you're not convinced by my explanations, please refer to the recent discussions at the Television project, where this came up a few days back with regards to the ''Cleveland Show''. As with your case, there were references indicating a planned run of \""x\"" episodes. However, despite that, the convention is to ''only'' list aired episodes in the infobox, with the other details going in the body copy. (With respect to your example, no \""20 (2 aired)\"", just \""2\"".) Other points raised include the fact that while 20 episodes may be planned for, they are not all actually ''produced'' as of yet. If the series is cancelled during its run, several of these episodes may never even be scripted or shot. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hey, thanks for the question. Unfortunately, in this case, it is a site that appears to have been spammed across just about any article the site's people could get away with. There were over 150 links to the site when I first noticed it, many of which were spammed by an IP in 2008 and a single-purpose editor in the past few days. Many of the links were added as \""references\"" to basic information that should come from more reliable sources, while other links were used to replace existing links from government sources. Hope this helps. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... please do not restore the link to the \""procon\"" site. Links to this site have been added en masse by single-purpose accounts and IPs, such as [[User:Proconorg]] and others. In some cases, these accounts have deleted valid government sources in favour of their own URLs. Thank you. --'''
[Ckatz]: I fail to see how this exchange is \""impolite\""; if anything, your replies to date have been far more provocative than mine. I've removed these links as an administrative action, one that was begun after noting the suspicious pattern in which they were, for the most part, added. There is no reason for you to issue \""warnings\"" and make spurious claims regarding politeness, as you have done. Furthermore, keep in mind that the spammed site was tagged onto the line ''\""Prostitution in Germany is legal along with brothel ownership\""''. There is no reason why this text cannot be referenced from an official government source. --'''
[Ckatz]: You are apparently ignoring the explanations I've already provided, the indication that there has been a concerted effort to spam this site, the fact that the information in question can easily be sourced from what would be a more appropriate source anyway, and the assessment by a second admin that site is not suitable as a reference. --'''
[Ckatz]: Problem is, the site has a demonstrated history of being spammed over a period stretching back at least a year. In such cases, it is desirable to avoid using the site at all. From what I've seen, the text it has been used to reference can all be replaced with more appropriate, more direct, and non-spammed sites. --'''
[Ckatz]: Again, by \""being spammed\"", I mean that there are several IP and SPA accounts whose edits consist solely of adding links to the ProCon site on a host of articles. When I first discovered the links, there were well over 150 of them. Many were in the external links sections, added one after another by the same account. Others were tossed into articles on text tha tcould easily be sourced more directly, or (in some cases) even used to replace more direct sources. Are some added by well-intentioned editors? In all likelihood, yes. However, based on what I have seen, these are a tiny minority of the total number of links, compared to the huge list of spammed links. Assuming good faith is important, of course, but when an account's entire history involves nothing other than adding ProCon links, and when those same format links appear throughout other articles, AGF has its limits in the face of a definite effort to spam the links. --'''
[Ckatz]: I've commented on the talk page, but I'll add here that the \""job\"" quote cannot be used to speculate about his job security, just as we cannot use the \""creepy\"" comment. Nor can we speculate about CBS and their policies, or Letterman's status with regards to those policies. Simply put, a lot of details with regards to this matter may well be better suited to Wikinews, as we have to look at the bigger picture to determine what is news and what is encyclopedic. --'''
[Ckatz]: Catherine, the use as you added it implies there is an issue with his job status. There is no evidence to suggest that, and we are not here to speculate, imply, or any other such task. If you are adamant about the line, get consensus on the talk page - but you need to do that ''before'' restoring it. --'''
[Ckatz]: With respect to the IPs, it's not a question of \""more than I would like\"". It is instead the ''fact'' that several IPs and accounts came to Wikipedia ''for no other purpose'' than to add dozens and dozens of links to the ProCon site. Furthermore, many of those links were added as external links in a manner contrary to what is permitted under the external links guideline, or used to replace existing references that in some cases were to more direct sources. It is a simple reality that any time you have a site that is being spammed by single-purpose accounts, or an editor whose primary role on Wikipedia involves promoting or using one particular source, you have to take a very close look at the site. In this case, the site itself is questionable as a reference source; any material they post without explanations of where they sourced it can't be verified by us, and any information they post from referenced sources should really be sourced here to that primary source (rather than the ProCon intermediary). --'''
[Ckatz]: The problem lies in the fact that the material is unreferenced. You may say that it is true - and it may well be true - but Wikipedia requires sources that can be verified by readers. If you can provide proof from [[WP:RS|reliable, verifiable sources]], then it would help in allowing the material to remain. --'''
[Ckatz]: Actually, you are the one who needs to stop your repeated efforts to add Wu-related material to articles where it does not belong. The ''class' of vehicle is relevant, but the ''make'' is completely irrelevant to the story, as evidenced by the news article you've linked to. (In the ''Times'' article, \""SUV\"" is mentioned four times, in the headline and the first, third and ninth paragraphs, whereas \""Yukon\"" is only a passing mention in paragraph seven.) Note that your terminology (\""self-described \""environmentalists\"") strongly suggests a POV on your part, one that cannot form a part of an article. --'''
[Ckatz]: You are more than welcome to open discussion regarding the matter on the article's talk page. However, I would point out that you are making several presumptions in your statements that are not grounded in fact. First and foremost, please do not presume that anyone who does not embrace your perspective on the matter is trying to cover something up, or that they hold an opposing view with regards to Wu. Simply put, an article was being repeatedly changed by IPs whose edits served only to further one and the same purpose, that is to add material only tangentially related to the subject of the article. Secondly, note that no-one is \""challenging the matter's worthiness to be included\"" in the ''Wu'' article, where it belongs. However, the focus of the controversy is not that Wu specifically drives a Yukon, but that ''he'' drives a SUV when making statements about environmental issues. The make of the SUV does not matter; for that matter, the fact he drives an SUV is irrelevant to the ''article'' about SUVs, and as such we don't add details on Wu to that article either. Beyond that, you were repeatedly adding the material despite being advised it was not appropriate to this article, a pattern that was proving disruptive to the article. Hence, semi-protection. If you can achieve consensus to add the material here, it can certainly return - but keep in mind that you would have to convince others that ''this'' abstract reference to a Yukon is more relevant than any other cultural reference to it. --'''
[Ckatz]: If you have concerns, discuss them on the article's talk page, so that all editors can participate. As for your actions, I must say that your decision to go through my recent contributions and look for problems with them is an interesting course of action. It may not, however, help you in your desire to appear innocent in all of this. --'''
[Ckatz]: FYI, it's not an article, it's a redirect page that you've proposed for conversion to a disambiguation page. So far, the serious arguments seem to lean toward keeping the redirect; the 24.* IP is just a disgruntled IP that is hounding my edits, and another editor has already commented that the entries you've proposed aren't especially necessary. Myself, I don't care either way what the page is, as long as proper procedure is followed. That is why I'm acting in an administrative role there, rather than as an editor with a particular preference. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... thanks for the note. You raise some valid points - and personally, I don't really care either way. (Keep in mind that I'm Canadian, so I use \""tire\"", not \""tyre\"".) However, the important consideration here is that per [[WP:ENGVAR]] we don't arbitrarily change the spelling of an article without discussion first, and (more importantly) in the case of ''this'' article, the title uses \""tyre\"". We would not change the spelling of the article without first changing the title to \""slick tire\"". If you feel strongly about the spelling, you are welcome to open a discussion to move the page and change the spelling. I can provide tips if you like, but it should not be done before such a discussion is complete. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: The categories have already been vetted through a [[Wikipedia:Categories for discussion\/Log\/2009 June 13#Category:2010s American television series|deletion debate]], and the resulting consensus was to keep them. These are not \""possible\"" categories, they definitely will be populated (as are their predecessors). --'''
[Ckatz]: All anyone needs to do is to look at your contribution history, which parallels mine. Funny how you \""just happen\"" to edit articles I've edited, in many cases in exactly the same order I've edited them in. Funny, too, how that pattern appears to be transferring itself from your IP account to your shiny new registered account. (I could, of course, just be paranoid. I'm sure it is just a complete and utter coincidence that you chose to edit [[Jackie Tyler]], [[arachnophobia]] and [[flashlight]] earlier today as 24.dot, or [[J.D. (Scrubs)]], [[click-through rate]] and [[Quebec City]] under your IP account on the 14th, each of those edits immediately following mine in the respective article histories.) --'''
[Ckatz]: Actually, I've never said you shouldn't make the specific edits. More to the point, if you had come across the articles in a purely random manner, or through a normal progression of editing, I wouldn't have anything to complain about. The troublesome factor lies in the way you are obviously monitoring the contributions list of an editor you've had a disagreement with, and then following that editor around the project to edit the same articles. You can attempt to dismiss this with more spurious claims, as you have done previously, but a simple comparison of our respective contribution histories will demonstrate my concerns regarding your activities on Wikipedia. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hmmm. Thanks for the tip. Glancing through that archive, it seems to support the use of Talkorigins as a RS when the cite is to a particular article and the author can be verified. However, the page I reviewed is a FAQ with no indication as to where the material comes form. If you have a chance to look over the page in question, I'd appreciate your thoughts on it. Thanks in advance. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thank you for your note. Unfortunately, Wikipedia has some very strict guidelines with respect to the use of external sites as either references or external links. The \""TVonMedia\"" site does not meet the requirements of our [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] guideline, and we do not generally permit [[WP:EL|external links]] to sites unless they provide a definitive benefit to the article. This should not be misinterpreted as a slight against the site; simply put, there are millions of web sites around the planet, and we cannot act as a directory service for them. As such, I would ask that you avoid adding links to the TVonMedia site. You are, of course, encouraged to contribute to the site in other ways. Please feel free to ask more questions if you would like. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Please see the preceding note, which explains why the URLs are not suitable for inclusion. --'''
[Ckatz]: It is unfortunate that you feel that way, but our guidelines on external links exist for a good reason, and they are based on years of discussion and debate. You are certainly welcome to contribute in other ways, of course. --'''
[Ckatz]: Such as [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Talk:Pluto&curid=186148&diff=325454401&oldid=325400085 this edit summary]... classic. Cheers, and thanks for the laugh. --'''
[Ckatz]: While it may seem confusing, you need to understand that Wikipedia does not treat fictional works as being \""in the moment\"". A series is viewed in its entirety, and as such we list ''all'' actors who have had main character status at any point during the run of the series. We do not use \""former\"" or similar subsections, and likewise we do not write about characters who have died or otherwise left as being in the past tense. This is a standard across all fictional works. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for sourcing references for the 9th season so quickly. Nice work. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for pointing this out. The user has been warned accordingly. --'''
[Ckatz]: Likewise. I can't give a firm time commitment, but I do have the page watchlisted (but of course...) and am always reviewing changes. Cheers, and thanks for taking this on. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hey, thanks very much, Hu. Very kind of you indeed. And, of course, thanks to you in return for your tireless work on the spam frontier. Cheers! --'''
[Ckatz]: Merci. I appreciate the information. --'''
[Ckatz]: You've pasted the same text into multiple articles, you've placed it in the lead (as opposed to properly integrating it into the body of the articles), and the text needs a rewrite to avoid what appears to be exaggerated language. In addition, a review of your contributions revealed some history of issues with POV and lack of discussion prior to contentious edits. If you wish to post the material, the best route would be to discuss it first. --'''
[Ckatz]: Per the editor who redirected this article back in March 2009, the page is little more than a track listing and fails the guidelines established by the Music project. --'''
[Ckatz]: I've provided links to the relevant policies and guidelines on your talk page. In a nutshell, Wikipedia is not a directory service; the simple fact that a link ''exists'' is not reason to link to it. --'''
[Ckatz]: Kheider, I hate having to do this, but I've removed the text for now until it can be further discussed. Having looked at the forum you referenced, it really felt as if Wikipedia was giving the concept far more weight than the discussions actually warranted. Even though it was Alan Stern mentioning the idea, we've no indication that he would support what was written. For all we know, it was just some people tossing around ideas. That aside, if we can track down more material to support the idea, it might well make for an interesting addition. Thoughts? --'''
[Ckatz]: I've re-reworked that section, and would also appreciate it if it could remain stable until we resolve this. Your changes there (and in other ocean articles) are problematic in that they suggest the Southern Ocean is still a \""work in progress\"", when in fact it is an active concept in use by the IHO and other world bodies. Any changes would need to reflect that fact, which is evidenced by the IHO's working groups, other marine organizations, and even the CIA World Factbook, all of which use the Southern Ocean terminology. (You are correct in that the 1953 guide does not include the Southern Ocean, but the problem lies in that your rewrites suggest the Southern Ocean term will not take effect until the 4th editon is published, which does not reflect the actual use today.) Given that the Oceans project has already seen fit to implement the Southern Ocean, it would help if we could seek consensus for the best wording on all the ocean articles ''before'' making changes of the nature you have done to date. (As it is, there is now also a fair bit of rewording necessary in the changes you've made to the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Ocean articles.) --'''
[Ckatz]: Where was it stated that the CIA publication isn't considered a reliable source? It's certainly in widespread use as a reference source in many articles across the project, and I can't see any discussions at [[Wikipedia:Reliable_sources\/Noticeboard|the WP:RS noticeboard]] that conclude it is unreliable. (The topic has certainly been brought up, for example [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources\/Noticeboard\/Archive 18#The CIA taken as an Authority|here]], [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources\/Noticeboard\/Archive 3#CIA - The World Factbook|here]] and [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources\/Noticeboard\/Archive 9#CIA World Factbook and US Department of State|here]], but the consensus is that the book ''is'' an acceptable source.) --'''
[Ckatz]: I agree that the resolution of this lies in finding a way to present all aspects of the matter. With regard to the IHO, I'd disagree that that text should be completely removed from the lead. We have to consider the fact that they are the defining body for these matters. We certainly need to present conflicting viewpoints, but we also cannot merely lump them in as \""just another viewpoint\"". (This is similar to Pluto's recent re-categorization as a dwarf planet; while we present alternative views, the definition from the defining body - the IAU - is regarded as the scientific standard.) I think you've put forward some good ideas, though, and will try to respond to them in more detail later today. --'''
[Ckatz]: --'''
[Ckatz]: Sorry, but what?!? How exactly is it POV? They originally defined the Southern Ocean in the 2nd edition, removed it for various reasons in the 3rd, then voted (and passed) a motion to restore it in 2000. They have announced their intention to publish it in the upcoming 4th edition, and it is in use by them and by other reliable sources. Your rewrite strongly suggests the IHO does ''not'' officially endorse their own plans, which is not an accurate depiction of what is going on at all. While the 3rd edition is still active ''pending the introduction of the 4th'', the IHO has '''clearly''' demonstrated their intention to move forward with the reintroduction of the term, and other reputable international bodies have acknowledged this and are proceeding in a similar manner. Our wording must reflect this reality, not obscure it. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello, and thanks for the note. No offence taken at all, and no worries about etiquette - first-timers are as welcome as anyone else. As for the links, I thought I'd commented on it, but apparently not. Generally speaking, we avoid external links unless they add significantly to the article. As well, we do not use what are referred to as \""inline\"" external links; that is to say, regular copy in the body of an article that is marked up with an external link. (Yes, there are thousands of them in articles, but cleanup is a slow process...) External links are for the most part used only in \""External links\"" sections, references, and some infoboxes. As such, I've gone through the section you were working on and removed all of the external links. I've left the name of the store you added, though, as that is useful. (Thanks!) Please feel free to ask if you have more questions about this or any other aspect of the project. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: I've restored the previous version for now. (Apologies for being away from this for a few days.) While this discussion is moving along, the text is still not ready for implementation. Your version still has issues in that it strongly suggests the IHO doesn't support its own concept, which is not the case. Realistically, we need to research the status better; we know the Southern Ocean definition has passed a vote, and we know the 4th edition publication hasn't been ratified. The question is whether the lack of publication changes the status of the vote; does the IHO consider the Southern Ocean to be official at this time. Again, we need to hash this out - probably on the SO talk page for greater input - and then have an RfC to get more opinions (given that this has ramifications beyond just the one article.) --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... thanks for the note. With respect to the Letterman show, it is a creative work, and as such continues to exist as a body of work even if no new episodes are in production. We would only switch to past tense if all copies of said work were destroyed, in which case it would be considered to no longer exist. (In a similar vein, ''Citizen Kane'' \""is\"" a film and ''War and Peace'' \""is\"" a book, despite production having ceased on said works.) --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... thanks for the note. Spam, in this sense, referred to the way in which this identical material was used into a series of film articles by an IP editor, without providing any real context or benefit to any of them. The text merely notes that the film is one of 174 films that qualify to be ''considered'' for an award nomination, which is not notable. (All that means is that it was released within the correct time period, screened in the US, and so on, not that it has achieved some special status.) Hope this helps. --'''
[Ckatz]: Sorry, but I really do not appreciate such unfair accusations, especially since they do not accurately reflect the true nature of the situation. I can understand if you disagree, but from my perspective this was simply a matter of choosing the best path to avoid an undesirable outcome. As you are aware, a move discussion was held that led to the outcome that is presently in place. Keep in mind that this move discussion was closed by an administrator with '''far more experience''' in these matters than you or I. (In fact, that admin chooses to spent a vast majority of his time on Wikipedia \""specializing\"", if you will, in assessing the outcome of move discussions and the relevant consensus that develops.) If you have an issue with his decision, by all means take it up with him - or re-open the discussion, as I've repeatedly advised you to do. Regardless of my own perspective on the matter, my actions are based solely on maintaining an existing consensus. The alternative, doing nothing and waiting to see if you would cross the line with respect to 3RR, was not a viable option in my opinion; I would much prefer to try to allow the situation to cool down rather than see an established contributor move into a position where he ends up with a suspension of editing privileges. This is possible in situations such as [[The Sun]], where there is an extremely low number of edits; page protection in this case does not interfere with an actively edited page. Note, too, that the page protection is ''temporary'', not permanent; if you are prepared to agree to stop reverting against the existing consensus, and instead discuss the matter, I'd be amenable to opening up the page again. I'm also fine with pointing you toward places where you can seek a second opinion, if you wish, and will assist you in that respect if you so desire. --'''
[Ckatz]: Actually, Wikipedia uses \""Intrust\"" per our style guide. The company may choose to use all caps, but we use conventional grammar rules. --'''
[Ckatz]: Stuart - thank you for the note, and for correcting the matter. The text was probably initially reverted because of the external links that were added. Wikipedia has fairly stringent standards for external links, as outlined in the [[WP:EL|external links guideline]]. As such, i have had to remove the links you added today as well. Please do not take this as a commentary on the quality of your site; it is merely a reflection of the fact that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a directory service. Please feel free to ask if you have additional questions about hits matter. Thank you again. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thank you for your note. Unfortunately, the link has been removed because Wikipedia is not a directory service, and we do not exist merely to list other web sites. You've said that Execcomp is \""the leading place\"" for compensation information. Who, exactly, has identified it as such? What does the site offer that would benefit Wikipedia readers, and how is that benefit greater than the boost Execcomp would receive from being listed here? --'''
[Ckatz]: FYI, Po'buster has posted [[Wikipedia_talk:Canadian_Wikipedians'_notice_board#French_in_Infoboxes|here]] as well. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks, and good catch. I looked at the contribution, the user page, and other aspects of the account, and your assessment seems bang on. Please let me know if you come across other similar cases; this user seems quite persistent. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: You cannot write text about your own work, and reference it with your own pages; it is a [[WP:COI|conflict of interest]]. Keep in mind that this is not a commentary on the ''quality'' of your work, but a reflection of the need to have independent editors assess it for inclusion. --'''
[Ckatz]: Please see the detailed discussion regarding this matter on Tony1's talk page. Tony had noted his intention to modify his script to avoid the counterproductive removal of beneficial links while cleaning up overlinking, but the script changes appear to have not registered with the system. As such, the long list of changes continued to introduce more problems by removing beneficial links. As it is far easier to redo the valid script-based changes once the script is repaired than it is for other editors to manually edit each and every article to repair the errors, the appropriate course of action is to undo the problem edits until OTny1 can implement his proposed fixes. --'''
[Ckatz]: No problem, and thanks for asking. I'd thought I was adding comments to the changes, but apparently I wasn't - so your questions were certainly justified. Yes, the problem lies in the useful links - such as the NBC one you've mentioned - that are erroneously removed along with the legitimate changes. I've restored the ''Friends'' version, but have left the ST:TNG changes as per Tony1's version; after double-checking, it appears that no network info was lost in the shuffle. Thanks again. --'''
[Ckatz]: Unless you are planning on ensuring that the problems your script is introducing are all dealt with - problems that are detailed on your talk page - than your actions are merely creating extra work for other editors who then have to clean up after your changes. In addition, you have yet to address the same problems that were introduced into the ''previous'' batch of edit you made a few days back. --'''
[Ckatz]: Tony, as I've clearly and repeatedly outlined on your talk page, what you've described as a \""second pass\"" was in fact the result of errors introduced in the first pass. I clearly explained my actions on your talk page, I clearly outlined the rationale behind them, and I even offered to help. You may have good intentions, but if the script is introducing new problems at the same time it is correcting existing ones, then measures are needed to rectify the situation. I did ask you about this a day or so ago, when I posted ''\""your recent edits to dozens of television series articles have stripped out links to various television networks, links which are certainly relevant in articles about series produced by and for those networks.\""'' Unfortunately, you resumed use of the script without addressing the problems. Please note that the articles are certainly not going to suffer from a temporary delay in processing, whereas it is unrealistic to expect other editors to have to check over every article to clean up introduced problems. --'''
[Ckatz]: Since we're apparently doing \""warnings\"", you should note that false warnings are frowned upon, and I'd also add that you are a fine one to speak of \""stalking\"" when you seem to appear on pages shortly after Tony does in an apparent effort to \""tag-team\"" him (such as your recent post here). One of the reasons why it is important to research events rather than just leap in with fake, unsubstantiated \""warnings\"" is that it helps to avoid posts that make you look foolish. Even the most cursory of examination of my contributions list - freely and easily accessible through my signature in addition to the usual methods - would demonstrate thousands upon thousands of edits to television-related articles, especially to the main articles for individual series. It is hardly \""stalking\"" when Tony1's actions tonight caused my watchlist to light up like a Christmas tree. --'''
[Ckatz]: Yes, thank you for locating that information. It was temporarily removed for verification, rewritten and reformatted, then replaced in the article just prior to your posting this. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks to both of you for this. Akraj's abuse of Wikipedia for personal benefit goes back several years. While he is primarily targeting me at this time, he and his socks have also attacked other Wikipedians who objected to his self-promotional edits (for example, at [[Talk:Sustainability]]) and his efforts at vanity spam were also rejected by the India Wikiproject. --'''
[Ckatz]: I certainly appreciate the note; thank you and likewise for vocalizing my frustrations. While I obviously disagree with the changes you made, consensus could certainly go either way. However, my bigger concern is that we (the collective \""we\"" in general, not just you and I and this one case) exercise more discretion in changing guidelines and policies than we might use in article space. (A emphasis on discussion ''before'' changes would help in this respect; that way, you and I could have agreed or disagreed on the talk page, others could hae chimed in, and then the final language could go in with a minimum of back-and-forth editing.) --'''
[Ckatz]: Your note summarizes the problem. It is your opinion that your method is better; at least two other editors disagree. Per the long-established [[WP:BRD|\""bold-revert-discuss\""]] concept, the onus is now on you to make the case for it on the talk page, '''not'' to simply keep restoring your preferred version. Note that you have now reverted your version back in [[WP:3RR|three times in less than 24 hours]]. --'''
[Ckatz]: It's actually not too bad. I've tweaked it a bit and moved some text further down; hopefully that will address your concerns. As for the \""New Coke\"" link, the two are really apples and oranges, I'm afraid. Changes to hosts, rapid cancellations, and the like are not uncommon in television, whereas the New Coke debacle was something unique in terms of corporate icons and product marketing. --'''
[Ckatz]: I've explained this on your talk page, but in short it has nothing to do with the accuracy of your comments. Instead, it is the fact that ''you'' (not you personally, but you as a Wikipedia editor and series viewer) are the one making the observations. Generally speaking, we do not note continuity, production, or other such errors with regard to television series and other works of fiction. Thee only exception is if said errors become notable in the real world through the observations of [[WP:RS}reliable sources]] such as an expert in the respective field. --'''
[Ckatz]: Please read through the talk page archives for [[Earth]], where you will find extensive discussions regarding this matter. The established consensus is to use the scientific perspective in this article. You certainly won't lose editing privileges for adding the material the first time; it is the repeated attempts to do so in the face of requests, explanations, and warnings that can lead to such actions. Please feel free to ask if you have any additional questions. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... FYI, I have restored the request for a check on the IP. Let me be perfectly clear - I mean no disrespect at all to your position as a clerk at the CU page. Ordinarily, I would support your assertion that this might be perceived as \""fishing\"", and as such would not even have made the request to begin with. However, as the admin who has had to oversee a large portion of the EHC matter, I can speak with authority in stating that this individual - who has been ''banned'' from the community - has a clearly defined pattern of block evasion, facilitated by use of multiple IP and registered sock accounts. As such, I have restored the posting with the request that this application be judged by a checkuser, given that it involves a long, long history of abusive behaviour. A simple review of this individual's contribution history, his sock account lists, and related incidents will demonstrate how these socks have been used in attempts to control article content, disrupt formal Wikipedia procedures (such as RfAs, ANI proceedings, and the like), and actively target Wikipedia users through extremely abusive behaviour on- and off-site. While the IP block at 65.31.103.28 may prevent him from using accounts from that location, he has a history of linking in form other ports with these sock accounts. --'''

[Ckatz]: Thank you for the note. I've added the page to my watchlist and will keep an eye on the situation. If the problem becomes more pronounced - say, for example, the IP starts reverting rapidly - please leave me a note, or contact any administrator for more immediate action. Thanks again. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... sorry to disturb, but in [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Mars&diff=prev&oldid=360305712 this edit] you removed a reference link from the article [[Mars]]. Is there a problem with that reference, or some other concern? (I've restored it for now, as there was no edit summary to explain the removal, but if you feel it should go please let me know and I'll revert myself.) Thanks in advance. --'''
[Ckatz]: Ah, found it - it references the \""red soil\"" text but was inadvertently removed a few days ago. I've restored it. Thanks again. --'''
[Ckatz]: (replied on user's talk page re\"" COI) --'''
[Ckatz]: Sorry, but the second comment in particular was not helpful at all. It is rather frustrating to see proponents of mass delinking continually reject, ignore, or treat with contempt any objections that are raised against their actions, then raise spurious complaints about those who raise the objections. (As for your comment about your edits being reverted, no offence, but there is no obligation to inform you about minor formatting issues. The articles appeared on my watchlist, I reviewed the changes, felt they were not beneficial, and thus reverted them. Nothing more, nothing less.) --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... you should post your thoughts on the article talk page to see if other editors feel it is suitable for inclusion. After reviewing the text, and the related article, there does not appear to be wide acceptance for the theory. Do you have information that suggests otherwise? --'''
[Ckatz]: Please note that pages are not - and ''cannot'' - be \""taken over\"" by any one editor. Content is open for editing by all, and there is no \""preferred version\"" that a company can approve or revert to. It is not strictly the \""employee\"" status as much as it is the connection to the company, either directly or indirectly. If GeoVector finds someone, in all likelihood that person will have the same COI problems that an employee would. What I was meaing was that the article needs someone ''independent of GeoVector, its employees and their associates'' who can fairly assess the matter. Please remember that the article is not GeoVector's page on Wikipedia, it is Wikipedia's page about GeoVector. There is a clear and distinct difference between the two concepts. --'''
[Ckatz]: As far as I can tell, the spelling I restored is consistent with the existing standard (British English), as it restored \""-our\"" (\""vapour\"") instead of the American \""vapor\"". --'''
[Ckatz]: Hey, thanks for the heads-up. It is yet another incident involving [[User:Akraj|Akraj]], an indef-blocked individual who feels he can use Wikipedia to promote his own theories and opinions. --'''
[Ckatz]: '''May 2010''' Hello, Mark... sorry to trouble you with this, but sometime in the past eight hours a glitch developed with respect to your very useful script. I'm using it on the Monobook skin, and what happens is that it now removes ''all'' entries from my \""Special:Contributions\"" list, not just those pages where I am the most recent contributor. (As there are no changes listed in the code for over two weeks, I'm presuming that it is a Mediawiki issue that's affecting the script.) Any thoughts on this? --'''
[Ckatz]: FYI, I've also opened a discussion [[Wikipedia:Village_pump_(technical)#Script_issue_-_User:Markhurd.2Fhidetopcontrib.js|here]] regarding the issue; one thought posted there is that it might be related to the activation of \""single-revision deletion\"" in that time period. --'''
[Ckatz]: No problem, and thanks for the note. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: There's an essay that speaks to this - [[WP:DUCK]]. In this case, the accounts have similar names, edit the same articles, and (most importantly) are adding the same information regarding apparent fan fiction. --'''
[Ckatz]: (replied on user's talk page) --'''
[Ckatz]: Hey, sorry this guy (indef-blocked vanity spammer [[User:Akraj]]) is now pestering you on your talk page. It is par for the course with him, unfortunately; whenever I revert his latest vanity spam additions, he targets someone I've recently interacted with in this fashion. If you want more info on the whole mess I can certainly give you a list of links to older discussions. Cheers. --'''

[Ckatz]: Again, sorry for the inconvenience. I'm not comfortable with adding protection to your talk page, especially without checking with you first, but you may wish to consider adding it yourself. Thoughts? --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... thanks for the reply. FYI, the banned user [[User:Akraj|Akraj]] is not ''likely'' to be one and the same with Anil Rajvanshi, he ''is'' Rajvanshi ''by his own admission'' several years ago. That user has been using Wikipedia to add links to his own material - opinion pieces, his web site, and so on - for several years now. He has used numerous rotating IP accounts and single-purpose accounts (as verified through Checkuser requests) to evade his block. he has also adopted a pattern of targeting editors who challenge his efforts, often with an abusive pattern of behaviour. (He has insulted editors, repeatedly reverted them, made accusations of bias and immaturity, and a sock of his was even CU'ed to confirm that he was attempting to disrupt my RfA.) Many of the \""citations\"" he adds are links to self-written opinion pieces and essays, as opposed to third-party reviews of his work. He also likes to use the socks to add fluffy text (''\""an interesting idea\""'' etc.) featuring his own ideas. Over the past year or so, he's been harassing me in particular because I've kept his typical articles watchlisted.  --'''
[Ckatz]: With respect to the citation in question, I researched the article history. As it turns out, you were in fact the one to add it here. However, I note that you have also edited the article [[dew]]. That article was repeatedly edited by known socks of Rajvanshi, in order to add the identical link to his own proposal. These IPs and socks were also responsible for repeatedly adding non-encyclopedic text promoting the proposal (such as ''\""An interesting concept of large scale dew condensation near the sea shore was made by scientists in University of Florida in 1980s\""''). Is it possible that you brought the text and the citation from ''that'' article when you added it to \""air well\""? The article history shows that on the day you added text about the sea water idea, the self-promotional citation was in fact present in \""dew\"" having been added by a [[Special:Contributions\/218.248.79.4|known IP sock of Akraj]] a few weeks previously in [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Dew&diff=286401126&oldid=286361578 this edit]. Note also that the abstract in question (I've seen it used by Rajvanshi himself before) outlines a ''proposed'' concept, not an actual method, and even states that the idea is not cost-effective. Even if we factor out the Rajvanshi-Wikipedia spam problem, the concept itself may not even be notable enough to warrant inclusion. --'''
[Ckatz]: It may well be correct. however, you need to source it to a [[WP:RS|reliable source]], not just a site whose author expresses opposition to ethanol. --'''
[Ckatz]: Not sure how, exactly, I'm supposed to have secured a Comcast IP up in Canada, let alone used the IP to edit dozens of articles I've never visited before. --'''
[Ckatz]: Interesting that the indef-blocked spammer Akraj is choosing another banned user as his model. Even more interesting, Mr. Rajvanshi, is that you've selectively chosen to present HarryAlffa's ''draft'' ArbComm note, but completely ignored the fact that his claims were utterly rejected. You have also forgotten to mention [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Special:Log&type=block&page=User%3AHarryAlffa HA's block history], with blocks for ''\""disruptive editing\""'', ''\""persistent battlegrounding\""'', ''\""persistent reverting against consensus\""'', ''\""using ArbCom elections as personal agenda platform\""'', and finally the indef ban for a ''\""systematic pattern of disruption, personal attacks, incivility, not here to build an encyclopedia\""''. On a related note, would you care to discuss [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=block&user=&page=User%3AAkraj&year=&month=-1&tagfilter= your own block history], which involves ''\""spamming  links to external sites\""'', ''\""sockpuppetry\""'', and finally ''\""abusing multiple accounts: harrassment under other accounts\""''? --'''
[Ckatz]: I've also emailed you with respect to this, but as far as I know, the only posts I've ever removed are the repeated attack posts directed against me by abusive sockpuppets of an indef-blocked user per Wikipedia's policies regarding the prohibition of block evasion. If any of your posts were removed, it most certainly was an unfortunate error. --'''
[Ckatz]: Whoops, you don't have email. --'''
[Ckatz]: As pointed out to you by [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Vertigo_Acid&diff=prev&oldid=364880227 Vertigo Acid], it is a very relevant link. Using loaded terms such as \""swamped\"" and \""plastered\"" - which are completely out of context to this case - serves only to sidetrack the conversation. You'd find I'd be a lot more supportive of your delinking campaign if you focused on the real problems (such as excessive multiple links, terms that truly don't need links, etc.) instead of obsessing over useful, relevant links. By the way, I'll state yet again that I really do not appreciate misleading posts such as [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Vertigo_Acid&diff=364876750&oldid=344304323 your initial comment] on Vertigo Acid's talk page. That does not help the collaborative process. --'''
[Ckatz]: Simply put, repeatedly removing valid issue templates is not kosher. The article is interesting, but not encyclopedic in tone, and that is not a reflection on the subject but instead on the way it is currently written. We are not here to present flowery prose about a subject, we are here to deliver clear, accurate, properly sourced information in an encyclopedic manner. With respect to verifiability, simply saying \""everything is true and verifiable\"" along with a long list of books and sites doesn't help a non-resident to verify the claims; saying the subject is \""different\"" doesn't mean that we can dro the encyclopedic style. (I'd also appreciate it if you'd skip the silly ''\""vested interest\""'' claim; it makes no sense, given my geographic location, and serves only to distract from the real issue. Thanks. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thank you for your note. I see now where your confusion lies; you appear to be misinterpreting the expressed concerns as an argument for ''not including'' the article. That is not the case; what needs to be done is that the ''writing'' and ''references'' need to be brought in line with Wikipedia's standards. Copyediting serves to rework the writing style, layout, etc. to make the article match other entries; peacock terms are overly promotional words and phrases that - while appropriate for promotional literature - do not belong in an encyclopedia article. Finally, with regard to references, you have provided a list of books and links. However, not all of those entires meet the standards of our [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] guideline, and they also need to be matched to the important facts and details in the article. Given that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia that anyone can edit, we place a high importance on making sure that any reader can also ''verify'' the facts that are presented. I hope this eases your concerns. --'''
[Ckatz]: While I remain skeptical as to your true intentions, I would be interested in seeing honest answers to these questions. --'''
[Ckatz]: TisTRU, '''no-one is suggesting the article should be deleted'''. It requires cleanup, and the tags are there to draw the attention of skilled copy editors. As for the references, it is simply a case of taking the sources, identifying which ones meet the [[WP:RS|reliables ources]] guideline, and then matching those up to details in the text. Again, '''no deletion is proposed'''. --'''
[Ckatz]: I think you're misunderstanding the purpose of the \""main article\"" tag; it points readers to an article that expands on the content presented in the section. --'''
[Ckatz]: Once again, it's not the story, it is the writing. It needs to be rewritten in an encyclopedic style. --'''
[Ckatz]: Not sure how many times this has to be repeated... the wording of the articles needs to be re-written in order to match Wikipedia's house style. Again, you really, really need to read through the [[WP:MOS|Manual of Style]] to familiarize yourself with what is expected for articles. As for your claims above, I've never said it was fabricated, never called for deletion, never said the subject was unsuitable - those are all your personal, repeated ''misinterpretations'' despite numerous attempts to convince you otherwise. If you think the revised wording needs tweaking, then tweak it - it was put in as a demonstration for you to see what is needed. --'''
[Ckatz]: Tony, you say you wish to have productive engagement. Here's a good starting point: please stop misrepresenting the people who disagree with you. For example, you have repeatedly announced to the community that I want to link everything. I cannot comprehend why you insist on doing that, especially since I've told you that is incorrect many, many times, I've asked you over and over not to keep making such misleading statements, and - perhaps most telling - ''I do not actually do anything of the sort''. I'm sure you would find it very frustrating if I had been repeatedly telling other editors that you hate links and won't rest until articles are completely in plain text. How are we supposed to move forward in such an environment? --'''
[Ckatz]: Not improper in the least, thank you very much for pointing that out. The block should probably be adjusted accordingly. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: You have to consider whether or not the incident is relevant to a global audience, and whether or not it is [[WP:UNDUE|undue weight]] on a relatively minor incident. --'''
[Ckatz]: It would be helpful if you could assume good faith, rather than making spurious (and grossly incorrect) claims. Please actually look at the edit history, where you will note that my contributions primarily involve removing spam links placed by individuals trying to use the article as an advertising opportunity. --'''
[Ckatz]: It should be self-evident, but I've already left an explanation on your talk page. There are at least five elements of your post that are clearly not \""good faith\"" assertions. You may have meant well, but your post did not convey that in any way. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the note. If you can find a different (and [[WP:RS|reliable]]) source to verify the text, please feel free to restore it. The IAE site, however, has been added to the spam blacklist. Thanks again. --'''
[Ckatz]: Having investigated this further, all of [[Special:Contributions\/Susieq3140]]'s edits appear to be for the sole purpose of promoting these \""awards\"" form the US Sports Academy, using a \""third party\"" reference to a domain owned by the same place. --'''
[Ckatz]: I also tracked down an AfD from a few years back ([[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\/United States Sports Academy]]) that led to the deletion of a number of articles about the awards themselves; the conclusion was that the awards were not notable. (The nom asserted that ''\""there was no evidence that the 'recipients' were aware of or accepted the 'honorary degrees'\""''.) --'''
[Ckatz]: Actually, per [[WP:LINKROT]], we tag the link as dead. I've now done so; sorry for forgetting to place that template at first. --'''
[Ckatz]: TV series continue to exist as creative works, even after production of new episodes ceases. In a similar manner, we would not refer to a book or a film using \""was\"". --'''
[Ckatz]: You cannot post links to your own opinion pages. That is a clear violation of Wikipedia's guidelines and policies. --'''
[Ckatz]: (thanks - replied on your talk page) --'''
[Ckatz]: One wonders why they never stop even when warned. He's now got 31 hours to think about how to contribute productively. Thanks for tagging in. --'''
[Ckatz]: No problem, happy to help. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: The \""Overmind\"" site appears to feature a large collection of blogs that anyone can sign up to contribute, so I'm not convinced we can use it as a reference source (unlike some other Zap2it sub-sites). In the particular case of Brittany Frederick, she does not seem to be an authority on reviewing the technical qualities of Blu-Ray discs, but instead a fan who is ecstatic that her favourite show is now on Blu-Ray. --'''
[Ckatz]: I guess it would depend on the quality of the interviews. Her blog on the Blu-Ray seemed to \""gush\"", so I'd be cautious in what she writes about the people as she may have just asked a lot of soft questions. --'''
[Ckatz]: Good point about the DVD sections, by the way. I think if we develop them further to include interesting points perhaps about how the presentation differs from the original broadcast - for example, if it is the only place to find hi-def or if the director uses the release as a chance to do the version he or she actually wanted to do originally - than we can make them more valuable to the reader. --'''
[Ckatz]: Those two pages are semi-protected because of significant back-and-forth edits from IPs; it should not affect you (nor was it directed at you) as you are a registered editor. --'''
[Ckatz]: Good point - hadn't thought of that. Thanks for mentioning it. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Sorry, I have to disagree with certain aspects of what you have said. While I can appreciate the issues you've identified, this is not a trivia section, but a section about the characters presented in a series. Most well-developed articles about series will incorporate such a section, which is why I felt that the wholesale deletion of the material was not appropriate. As you may have noted by now, I have started trimming and cleaning up the individual entries to remove commentary and focus on facts. I will need assistance from editors who are more familiar with the show in verifying some details from show content. --'''
[Ckatz]: Actually, you were the one removing them; it would have been best to stop when you were initially reverted, instead of removing the names repeatedly. --'''
[Ckatz]: Please do not mislabel this as \""vandalism\"". Note the link to AN\/I [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard\/Incidents&diff=prev&oldid=404481613 here], and the comment that the IP was a sock of a blocked\/banned user. --'''
[Ckatz]: No mistaken identity, Shootbamboo, although I see the mixup with the vandalism label. Note that the IP is a sock of a banned user, and as such not permitted to post or edit. Hence the removal. --'''
[Ckatz]: Excuse me? The change I fixed was to link the terms separately, in order to avoid using [[Vancouver, British Columbia]] (which is a redirect to [[Vancouver]]). Note that you then self-reverted without noting your error. --'''
[Ckatz]: OC, your hide was unwarranted and also rather selective. So, too, was your post at AN\/I, especially since you chose to ignore the incivility and sidetracking perpetrated by some of your compatriots on the linking page. However, I do welcome any outside attention that the AN\/I post might bring to the real problems on that page. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the notification; I have responded there. --'''
[Ckatz]: FYI, rumours regarding David Tennant's personal life have been a problem with respect to that article for years now. While many IPs and new editors have added text about it, there has not yet been a reliable enough source to support keeping the material. Before removing the ''Mail'' link (it was added elsewhere earlier today), I did review it and also searched Wikipedia for past discussions regarding the ''Daily Mail'' as a [[WP:RS|reliable source]]. An extensive discussion appears to have developed the conclusion that it is best to ensure that the ''Mail'' is not the ''only'' source we're using; that is to say, if another reliable source (not the ''Sun'' or other tabs) publishes the same information, we can proceed. Keep in mind that, given Tennant's popularity, there should be wide-spread coverage in Britain if it is in fact real. We lose nothing by waiting a few days to see what turns up. --'''
[Ckatz]: The page was set up with indef. pending and ''short-term'' semi due to a rash of unsourced\/poorly sourced changes. However, given the discussion at [[Talk:David Tennant]], it is worth ending SP early to see what transpires. Thanks for bringing it up. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... thanks for posting. I've since restored a mention of the organization, minus the overly PR-sounding parts. If you can find third-party analysis or commentary on their work, it may warrant expansion. Please feel free to let me know if you need assistance or have any other questions. Thanks again, and welcome to Wikipedia! --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... thanks for the follow-up. Actually, we did end up restoring the text once the ''Times'' report appeared, along with the qualifier that neither Tennant or Moffett had confirmed it. There's still uncertainty as to the accuracy, given that all the reliable ones - Times, Wired, etc - seem to be basing their reports on the original ''Sun'' and ''Mail'' reports. You can see the discussion at [[Talk:David Tennant]]. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: No, shouldn't end that way. I'll post to the talk page and we can see what the result is. Fair enough? --'''
[Ckatz]: No objections, I should have been clearer in saying that a redirect would preserve the work done so far - formatting, userbox, etc. - that a deletion would eliminate. Thanks for doing the redirect. --'''
[Ckatz]: While you have cited certain aspects of the BLP policy, please note that you err in saying that it is ''your'' page. Wikipedia pages are not the same as personal pages on a subject's own web site, and the subject cannot dictate what information is and is not displayed. (Otherwise - ''and please let it be perfectly clear that I am not in any way suggesting ''you'' are trying to do this'' -  a subject could for example simply reject any content that they feel portrays them in a negative manner.) Also, this request is somewhat complicated by the fact that you have presented some of this information, such as your place of birth, in your own books. Finally, while they may possibly be room to accommodate your request, any such request would need to go through the Foundation so as to privately verify that you are actually who you say you are. (Nothing personal, but it is an anonymous system here - anyone could claim to be anyone in the absence of proof to the contrary.) --'''
[Ckatz]: However, as per past discussions, the encyclopaedia uses the international IHO terminology, as evidenced by the respective articles. It would be confusing to have the newly added navbox using a different term from the articles. I have reworked your note to reflect what the related Australian articles use. Would it help with your concerns if we put \""<small>(Southern Ocean)<\/small>\"" under the Indian Ocean entry? --'''
[Ckatz]: Actually, I went ahead and tested such an entry. I then reverted it out, but you can see it [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Victoria_(Australia)&oldid=409421705#See_also here]. --'''
[Ckatz]: One, you need to let others make that call; as a new editor (and one whose only contributions involve trying to add the material) you'll need to work to avoid being considered a [[WP:SPA|single-purpose editor]]. --'''
[Ckatz]: It appears to closely resemble [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\/DVDVideoSoft]]. --'''
[Ckatz]: Semi-protected for two weeks, can be extended if the problem returns. Thanks, and sleep well... --'''
[Ckatz]: Noted, and I've updated the rationale. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Sure, why not? Maybe it will get some more regulars involved... --'''
[Ckatz]: The problem lies in some of the language used, as it was non-encyclopedic and (in some cased) rather loaded. (For example, the description of Aitken as a \""political prisoner\"".) As well, several of the references used were unacceptable as they were from blogs and\/or opinion pieces. I have now reworked the material to bring it into line. --'''
[Ckatz]: Please see the [[WP:EL|external links guideline]]. Wikipedia is not a directory service. Thanks. --'''
[Ckatz]: The promotional aspect appears because you appear to be connected to the articles, given that your account name is the same as the reference name you chose. If this was simply a case of using your own name to name the reference, then please disregard. However, the site you linked to - \""Clickheredummy\"" - does not constitute a [[WP:RS|reliable source]] and cannot serve as a reference. We have no way of knowing if the article is in fact from ''Popular Mechanics'', as they claim, nor do we know if they even have permission to republish said article. If you can find a source that meets the reliable source protocol. by all means add it (and please feel free to ask if you have questions about any potential sources you may find). --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... sorry to have to ask this, given all your work here, but you need to stop reverting the word \""season\"" in place of \""series\"" for the list of Doctor Who episodes. Despite the airing on BBCA, the article is written in British English and as such uses the appropriate spellings. (We do not mix spellings, as demonstrated in [[Cheque]].) Incidentally, I dialled up your contributions to see if you had posted about the \""series\""\/\""season\"" matter and noticed that you were also reverting in \""Quebecois\"" at the \""Iron Chef\"" list. Again, please note that we would in fact use \""Canada\"" in that case; the notes refer to the country and the subject's own article uses \""Canadian\"". Thanks in advance. --'''
[Ckatz]: We would need a definitive source (i.e. ABC or the production company) to illustrate that the period is in fact considered a part of the title (as opposed to a stylistic matter). ABC's official schedule does not incorporate the period as part of the title. I have reworked the lead accordingly. --'''
[Ckatz]: The site does not appear to meet the requirements for an article, and there have been more than half a dozen accounts created solely to promote this site. Unfortunately, yours appears to be yet another one. --'''
[Ckatz]: Ah, that edit... that was when I transcluded part of the guideline so that we could lock it (and leave the rest open). Unfortunately, what was revealed afterward was that it can make the diffs rather hard to read, because you seem to end up with a mix of the diff from ''that date'' for the material in the page you're reading and the diff for ''today's'' date from the page that is trancluded (or something like that - basically, it's a mess, and I avoid doing it unless absolutely necessary). Edits seem to disappear from the history, even though they are clear in the actual page content. (Unfortunately, I can't help with your question about any discussions; I don't recall anything about NBSPs, but then again I wasn't pondering them at the time and as such wouldn't have been looking for any such discussions. Sorry...) --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the heads-up; I've added the page to my watchlist and will monitor developments. --'''
[Ckatz]: See the list of episodes, which describes how the nine episodes intended as a seventh season were merged into the sixth season. You are double-counting those nine episodes. --'''
[Ckatz]: Done, thanks for the note. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the quick response. FYI, the regs for sourcing material for [[WP:BLP|biographies]] tend to be much stricter than for other articles, and thus there is more likelihood that material will be pulled until a citation can be found (as opposed to tagging). With respect to your edit, I'd suggest that you apply at the spam whitelist to see if you can get that particular page whitelisted for that article. As an aside, it would seem that the second set of text - \""at an early age...\"" - is not needed and a bit PR-ish. (For encyclopaedic purposes, the reader can come to that conclusion by the fact that she started so early.) Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks, I've fixed the ''Oprah'' article. The category is only applied once the final episode has aired. --'''
[Ckatz]: Note that, while pages may sometimes ''initially'' be posted by an agent or other such representative, once posted they are subject to the standards expected of all articles. There is no \""ownership\"" permitted, and articles cannot be rewritten to suit the desires of the subject or their PR representatives. --'''
[Ckatz]: I'm presuming that you are one-and-the same as [[User:Sheldonsheldrake]]. If so, you would be better served in sticking to just one account. Also note that we are not \""pushing the negative\""; if you check the reviews I went to the trouble of adding as references, you'll see that it includes a positive review. Also note that we're not highlighting direct quotes from the reviews any more, but instead simply stating a basic fact about the reception. I'm sure that, if the RT rating was exceptionally high, you'd expect that detail to be mentioned. Also, please note that it is very likely that many of the articles about \""newer\"" directors and producers are largely contributed by their representatives. However, the probability that those articles - which would tend to be rather low-traffic - have not been properly reviewed by uninvolved editors does not warrant taking similar actions in one that has. --'''
[Ckatz]: Well, the first link is to the RT page, which includes all of the reviews. By the way, the fact that his film had such an exceptionally low critical reception is certainly a relevant fact about Mr. Glatzer's life, one that is certainly more notable than the release date for the DVD. --'''
[Ckatz]: I've restored the changes, with the rationale noted in he edit summary. It may not have been clear, but my edits did not remove all of your changes. Some were kept, some were reverted, and others were trimmed for brevity. No-one will doubt your efforts. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the note. I will look into the matter and let you know where to apply for the change. Please feel free to leave me a reminder if you have not had a reply in a week or so, in case I am busy. Cheers. Your translation was not a problem, by the way; I hope mine is also acceptable:<blockquote>''\""Merci pour cette note. Je vais \xe9tudier la question et vous laisser savoir \xe0 qui s'adresser pour le changement. S'il vous pla\xeet n'h\xe9sitez pas \xe0 me laisser un rappel si vous n'avez pas eu une r\xe9ponse dans une semaine ou deux, au cas o\xf9 je suis occup\xe9. Cheers. Votre traduction n'\xe9tait pas un probl\xe8me, soit dit en passant, j'esp\xe8re que le mien est acceptable.\""''<\/blockquote> --'''
[Ckatz]: No problem, I appreciate you taking the time to reply. Wikipedia articles treat a series as a complete body of work, instead of a collection of individual events. Essentially, we document the entire run instead of being \""in the moment\"". (Fictional works exist in what has been described as a \""perpetual present\"" in that the current reality is entirely dependent upon which episode you are watching.) An actor who serves in a main role is thus always represented as such, and is not relegated to \""former\"" status. Hope this helps. --'''
[Ckatz]: The information about the award was in fact retained; however, it was reduced to the essential details that relate to the tower, and moved up a bit. The other material was more related to your company and was not needed. Please keep in mind that, as an employee of the company, you do have a [[WP:COI|conflict of interest]] with respect to adding said material. It is better to ask on the talk page as to the encyclopaedic nature of the material rather than simply adding it. (This is not to discourage you from contributing; however, it would be more appropriate to add material that you can draw upon from a more general experience with engineering rather than text specific to your company and its projects.) --'''
[Ckatz]: I would say that it is really a mistake to resort to heavy-handed threats like that; not only are you somewhat misrepresenting the situation, but it unnecessarily adds tension to the discussion. Please note that ''you'' are the one who removed the long-standing text that is in fact supported by the reference, because you erroneously thought the link was dead, and ''you'' are the one who repeatedly deleted text three times after that. While I may have restored ''my'' attempt at compromise a second time, my subsequent edit involved rolling back to the existing consensus version (consensus in this case meaning the one that had been accepted for quite some time) so that we could discuss the matter on an even footing. (Your rationale for removal was predicated on the assumption that the link in question was dead; it was not, but even if it was it could easily have been tagged as dead given that the source - the BBC - is certainly reliable. Also note - and I say this while recognizing the ''spirit'' of 3RR - that I did not actually revert 4 times in 24 hours.) Honestly, the best and most proper approach on both our parts should have been to properly respect [[WP:BRD]]: you removed some text, I restore it, then we discuss. Unfortunately, neither of us took that route; while we are discussing it now (and hopefully getting additional voices as well) please leave aside the needlessly provocative threats. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for passing that along. However, after looking at Mr. Kohs' work on that site, I have significant concerns about whether he is actually intending to write a balanced piece. His writing seems heavily skewed to a particular POV with regard to Wikipedia, one that I can't help but wonder may be influenced by the fact he is trying to promote his own for-profit wiki. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hmm... having reviewed more of his work, I don't trust him at all. Highly sensationalized, lacking in any apparent journalistic standards, apparently just trying to stir up the muck.  No thanks. --'''
[Ckatz]: --'''
[Ckatz]: Skomorokh, I'm sure you are operating in good faith, and I do regret it if you object to my removal of Peter Damian's comment from your page. However, Damian - the user operating as the ever-changing IP 109.x - has been banned from the community, and that includes any contributions made as an IP sockpuppet. If you disagree with this, you need to take it up at the appropriate forum. However, we cannot simply revert a banned user's material back in. --'''
[Ckatz]: You can take responsibility for the content, but the link has to stay out. Furthermore, please note that the policy clearly outlines that \""bans apply to all editing, good or bad\"". Also, with respect to \""edits by and on behalf of banned editors\"", note the text that states: ''\""Wikipedians in turn are not permitted to post or edit material at the direction of a banned editor (sometimes called proxy editing or proxying) unless they are able to confirm that the changes are verifiable and they have independent reasons for making them\""''. You may have your own opinions about Mr. Damian - I can't speak to that - but it does not override the fact that his behaviour has led to a ban from Wikipedia. Quoting from [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard\/Incidents&oldid=305734197#Peter_Damian the discussion regarding that ban]:<blockquote>''\""He's banned, full stop - his accounts are blocked. Any socks are blocked. Any IP addresses or additional accounts linked to him after the ban passes are blocked.\""''<\/blockquote> --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... with respect to the Kohs matter, I just wanted to be clear that I realize you are merely the messenger. I appreciate that you took the time to pass on the request. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... with respect to the Kohs matter, I just wanted to be clear that I realize you are merely the messenger. I appreciate that you took the time to pass on the request. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Re: the above, Damian has repeatedly used IP socks (as well as sock accounts, apparently) to edit the \""Sum of Logic\"" page. He has also indicated, through his actions and his posts, that he has no intention of stopping this behaviour or to stop trying to get links to his site. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks for the feedback; I'm glad that the tweaked version works for you. I'd be happy to take a look at the intro you mentioned over the next few days; please feel free to remind me if I forget. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: I will investigate through the television project, but the convention is (as far as I am aware) to avoid years. Furthermore, we would not use \""Season One\"" but instead \""Season one\"". --'''
[Ckatz]: Your \""praise\"" was sarcastic in nature, or at least that is how it read. If you meant differently, I'm prepared to assume good faith. However, the escalation of this minor, minor matter to arbcom is - IMHO - way over the top, and I have responded there accordingly. --'''
[Ckatz]: Your domain, as I'm not a viewer. However, note that you'll have to source the articles and establish notability for them from independent sources. Also, note that you should only add article titles to the template once an article exists. We avoid red links in templates. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Ah, didn't see the duplicate entry. Thanks for catching that. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks... check out the rewrite, and let me know if it works for you. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Elen, could you please point me to the discussion regarding the so-called \""courtesy blanking\"" of pages relating to Peter Damian? I find it rather surprising that we are wiping out pertinent notices with regard to a banned, known problem user. Thank you in advance. --'''
[Ckatz]: While I can't speak to what ArbCom agreed to, I don't agree with your statement about not tagging at least the registered socks. However, we'll see if PD can stay away. FYI, though, you might need to add a different rationale to the speedy for the IP pages as U2 doesn't appear to cover IPs who have edited. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Simply put, it is not suitable content. The page is intended as an overview of the concept, not as a site to highlight specific businesses. (Wikipedia is not a promotional tool.) However, you are encouraged to contribute in areas where you do not have a direct conflict of interest. Please feel free to ask if you would like assistance in doing so. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Feel free to revert, if you must. A few thoughts, though. One, it is most certainly not uncommon to blank or otherwise remove that sort of information from blocked or banned users. Two, the edit in question can ''in no possible way'' be defined as an \""edit war\"". Alison changed the material, someone else reverted her good-faith change, it drew my attention (having had to block one of the user's socks) and I removed his contact information. I think a more appropriate question would be why it is necessary to ''keep'' a series of links for a banned user. --'''
[Ckatz]: Hello... saw your post. Frankly, there was nothing incorrect in blanking the information. ArbCom blocked\/banned the individual; unless there is information to the contrary, they did not state that we could not delete the contact information. Furthermore, there is nothing unusual about blanking pages of banned users, and we don't typically maintain off-site contact information for someone who has violated Wikipedia's rules to such a degree that they manage to get banned. Lastly, there most certainly was nothing that could be described as an edit war. You can of course decide as you see fit, but it would be more appropriate to leave the information off of the page. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Note that an indef user who no admin will unblock is effectively banned, especially when one factors in that Kohs was unblocked and then reblocked several times. There is also nothing out of the ordinary in blanking off-site links from the pages of such a user. After all, the external links and sites were a definite factor in the original blocks. --'''
[Ckatz]: FYI, I've tweaked your edit to standardize on British English (\""colour\"") instead of the US \""color\"". Thanks for catching the inconsistency; however, looking back through the article history, it appears to use British English from at least five years ago. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: FYI, I've reverted your changes with respect to this. There doesn't appear to be any discussion leading to the changes, and a similar attempt last year was not accepted either. If consensus for the change does develop, then so be it, but that needs to happen first given the number of articles it would affect. Please let me know if there are any articles with unrelated grammatical changes that may have been inadvertently reversed in the process, as I can assist in restoring them. Cheers. --'''
[Ckatz]: Thanks, I'll check it now. --'''
[Ckatz]: Fair enough, as long as there's someone on top of it as it needs a good copy edit. Cheers. --'''"
Redhanker,False,"[Redhanker]: Can you check if there was ever an article for \""Kenneth Eng\""? It seems to have been deleted, if so could you supply me with an archive of the article?"
Phoenix-wiki,False,"[Phoenix-wiki]: Yeah, its nothing personal. The relevant ANI post is at [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard\/Incidents#Peculiar actions of apparently non-vandalist editor]]. Well, we're starting to think there's nothing wrong here and you should be unblocked whenever. In the mean time, you can create an alternate account to take part in the discussion (We ''are'' blocking you because we think your account is compromised, not because your a vandal or anything like that, so it's okay)--"
Fbifriday,False,"[Fbifriday]: You removed what you called \""POV\"" language from the article [[Dan Maffei]] in [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Dan_Maffei&curid=7891404&diff=371653325&oldid=371650867 this edit]. I have to disagree with you on the POV wording of the sentence. The statement was fact, and while the sources were no where near neutral POV, the fact is that he voted against the motion that did exactly what the sentence you removed said it did. So the sentence was in no way off of a neutral POV, as it was a fact. Might we put the statement back up for now and take it to the talk page to see if anyone else agrees with either you or myself? --
[Fbifriday]: Fair enough, you make a valid point that the way the editor made his string of edits was not in line with BLP standards. I do, however, believe that the debate should be held as to whether or not it should be included. I do not necessarily agree with holding it on the Congress project page, as it may discourage people with an opinion on this from commented as they may not be able to find the debate, so I would be more comfortable with holding the debate on the talk page for the article in question. Please be aware I have no personal stake in this, I'm just a recent changes patroller who noted your edit as one that needed to be addressed somehow, and I see a more open consensus via article talk page as more beneficial to the article.--"
Fys,False,"[Fys]: ..for the barnstar. [[User:Fys|Fys]]. &#147;
[Fys]: Do not identify editors' real life identities. Ever. [[User:Fys|Fys]]. &#147;
[Fys]: It is a fairly obvious case of [[WP:HARASS|harassment]] using my real life identity, bogus application of irrelevant policies, and rehashing dead and unconnected issues to try to cause harm to me. I am under no editing sanction. You should not have done it and you should apologise. [[User:Fys|Fys]]. &#147;
[Fys]: [[WP:BLP]] applies only where material is not adequately sourced, so that's irrelevant. You were blatantly infringing [[WP:AGF]] on my edits. You raised an irrelevant case that is now long over just to blacken my name, and then you linked it to my real life identity in blatant violation of [[WP:HARASS]]. As far as the rest, I'd like to know how you can make a case that you didn't create [[Miranda Grell]] as an attack page, with a blatant conflict of interest, and as part of a campaign of tendentious editing. Sadly there is no [[WP:HYPOCRISY]] policy under which you can be blocked. [[User:Fys|Fys]]. &#147;
[Fys]: But then we come to your whopping great big mistake. How on earth do I have any conflict of interest at all? Only in the sense that I happen to support a particular political party. So do you! Where is the conflict of interest? There is no \""close personal connection\"". There is no personal connection at all (never met her). There is absolutely no rule that prohibits an editor from editing something on which they are known or suspected of having an opinion; it would rule you out from all British politics articles for a start. So I repudiate the suggestion that I have any conflict of interest at all. And I'm not going to have all my edits viewed through the prism of the worst-case scenario reading that they must be all politically-motivated. That is intense harassment of the most despicable kind. It poisons the whole atmosphere. [[User:Fys|Fys]]. &#147;
[Fys]: It gets too complicated to lay out the full story in the lead. It goes 1987-1997 Labour MP for Glasgow Hillhead; 1997-2003 Labour MP for Glasgow Kelvin; 2003-2004 Independent MP for Glasgow Kelvin; 2004-2005 Respect MP for Glasgow Kelvin; 2005- Respect MP for Bethnal Green and Bow. The whole story is set out in the article and probably isn't worth summarising in the lead. [[User:Fys|Fys]]. &#147;
[Fys]: And you've done a good job. [[User:Fys|Fys]]. &#147;"
Lar,True,"[Lar]: Hi, I see you added Railbox and TTX to [[:Category:Cooperatives]]...  would you think that all the terminal roads (railways in and around a city owned by the major connecting railways in that city, for example [[Indiana Harbor Belt]] and union station companies (companies set up to operate large stations such as Chicago Union Station, etc) are also cooperatives? I'm wondering if adding these to that category actually adds information  or not. Also, would you say that the [[Conrail]] Shared Assets Area is a cooperative? it is owned by the two railroads that use it (it's what remains after Conrail was demerged)... I would say it is not. Just curious as to your thoughts. ++
[Lar]: Hi! I couldn't help but notice that the ABC article I started and self nom-ed didn't last long in DYK. I was quite honored that it was chosen but rather disappointed that it didn't last very long at all... Was there something about it that made it unsuitable? I saw that the target text I put in the suggestion got rather mangled to the point that it didn't quite say what it should have. It was my first nomination so while trying to avoid [[WP:OWN]] about the whole thing, I'm still rather curious. Thanks! (I've set a watch here so feel free to respond here, I'll see it) ++
[Lar]: No worries. Thanks for the explanation. Seems rather a thankless job, so thanks for doing it! And it was up long enough to get a bunch of good edits from a variety of other folks, so that's a plus too! (I am watching here, you don't need to copy over to my talk page, but thanks for that anyway.)... ++
[Lar]: Thanks! I appreciate the clarification\/support. ++
[Lar]: \""ANNOYED\"" eh? haha. userify the above article text to my userspace for me (I'm not an admin), and I'll create the Cliff L. Biffle article and merge it in... and then propose merges for the other two esoterics that you kept. How would that be? <font color=\""green\"">[[User:Lar\/Esperanza|+]]<\/font>+
[Lar]: (I watch what I start and prefer to keep all threads in one place, feel free to reply here, in fact please do...) K, thanks. I think I'll preserve the history via a series of moves, first to [[User:Lar\/Cliff L. Biffle]] then to [[Cliff L. Biffle]] once it's ready. See any problem with that?

Essjay did what was best for you and the project at this stage in your activities, (your wikicareer if you like) here. People look for certain qualities when they choose admins, among them experience, measured in time and number of good edits across many different areas, and understanding of how things are done. Keep contributing, learn the ways here, and if you're still interested in a few months, and interested for the right reasons (some felt maybe you were interested because you wanted to protect a particular page... that's not how things are done here) try again. Most people won't hold that you tried before against you. Best wishes. No reply needed but if you do, here is fine, I'll see it.

[Lar]: The problem is, how do you resolve the conflict between consensus and principle, or, how policy normally gets set (it follows consensus, which is based on what people say and do) and how it has been set in this case, it is derived from fundamental principles around what the WP project is, and from (somewhat oracular and thus hard to interpret crisply) statements the founder and chief policymaker has made, rather than based on what popular sentiment at the moment is.

[Lar]: No, I was in a different channel, a private cabal if you like, I guess you can say, which has much more reasoned discourse than even en-admins... I think it's useful to seek quick guidance, but absolutely feel that one should not take it as a replacement for judgement, and I don't think I do take it so, which is what your words imply, at least to my eyes. That's the major bone to pick here remaining. '''<font color=\""green\"">[[User:Lar\/Esperanza|+]]<\/font>[[Special:Emailuser\/Lar|+]]'''
[Lar]: Yes, see my comments there. My BIG learning so far is that I did not explain this well at all, that close statement wasn't any good. Usually I'm more verbose, but I really wanted to try to get 6 June closer to archivable.. it still has some thorny ones in there yet like the Lightsaber one (go try to make sense of that one!). As for mentioning DRV, I believe strongly in accountability, if I thought it was close, I wanted to not give the sense I wasn't open to review and feedback.

[Lar]: Oh! You said \""I guess we have slightly different approaches to how one might handle an AfD that one is unsure of.\""... There's an essay in there no doubt. So maybe the question to ask here is how DO you handle an AfD you're unsure of? Mine is (if I've decided it has to be me that closes it for whatever reason... perhaps because it's old) to seek additional input and to review the article, the comments, the contribution histories of the commentors, and weigh things. I'm not fond of relists as it seems to just postpone the issue a bit, but sometimes they're the way to go...

[Lar]: Accountability? you mean like [[:Category:Administrators open to recall]]? I think we may have to agree to disagree about this user, I think they have not been civil at all, regardless of admin actions. That said, I think there is merit in my letting some other admin deal with it next time. The problem is that every admin that this user interacts with eventually makes this user's animus list.  (and thus is disqualified?) Fortunately we have a lot of admins but it seems a bad practice. ++
[Lar]: Cyde is right, more later, but I am concerned about the notion that contributions give you a free pass, or that if an admin is a little bit uncivil it gives the other party a free pass in some people's eyes. That's just wrong. It's not about wmarsh leaving, it's about this culture that seems to value disruptive editors more than hard working admins. ++
[Lar]: As a reminder here's the poll for part 1: [[Wikipedia:State_route_naming_conventions_poll\/Part1]] and sure enough it says nothing about what states it applies to (only that two states get an exemption) ++

[Lar]: I moved [[User talk:Courtney Akins Archive]] to [[User talk:Courtney Akins\/Archive]] for you, because the accepted convention for archives (as with any other subpages in user space or user talk space) is to use a slash separator.

[Lar]: Your RfA writeup mentions that you've been seeking the courage to stand. I'm glad to see you have, so that I could support, but if during the process you find you need some fortification, I've supplied some liquid courage.

[Lar]: Hi... I saw this: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_arbitration&diff=129250327&oldid=129246652] .. seemed a reasonable action by a clerk, the case was \""fast tracked\"".  Then I saw this: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&diff=next&oldid=129250327] which totally confused me. Why did you revert NYBrad's action? Seems rather process wonky not to let the case get opened expeditiously. Are you someone that feels process is more important than doing the right thing efficiently? This case has overwhelming votes to open, many arbitrators seem to want it done right away, and NYBrad is a very good clerk. Wasn't it a bit of a slap to him to revert him that way? Aren't you going against consensus of the rest of the arbitration team by standing on process? (...you can answer here, I'll watch...) ++
[Lar]: A few points. First, I think what was being expedited here by NYB was merely ''opening the case'', not ''rushing to a decision''. I don't really see how \""giving the accused time to respond\"" has any actual bearing in this instance, they'll have plenty of time to respond during the case. Also, hasn't the \""accused\"" basically been blowing everyone off for a month already?  Second, while it may be true that \""society needs to be governed by dispassionate law\"", this isn't actually a democracy, nor is it a society... people don't have rights, there is no specific due process to follow, and it's not actually run by the rule of law. What it actually is, is a ''project'' to ''do'' something, to ''make'' something. Arbitration is a means to that end, that of creating an encyclopedia efficiently and harmoniously, not some system of justice that exists for its own sake. That you term your action \""overrule\"" in this matter rather than \""go against apparent consensus\"" strikes me as an issue in its own right... you aren't a judge, just one of us that we selected by consensus to help make things go smoothly. Third, NYB is, in my view, too nice a guy to give you a hard time about making things difficult for him, but that is you did. Once the case was opened, to go ahead and close it again so that it could be around for 24 more hours strikes me as really just a waste of everyone's time for no apparent reason. Fourth, I'm not privy to the arbcom mailing list but I do have to wonder what was said to you privately about this matter. I would be greatly surprised if it was uniformly positive.  In summation, it's my view that you messed up, and you could either dig in now and defend in depth, or just admit that in hindsight it perhaps wasn't the very best idea overall to summarily revert a clerk without discussing it privately with him first. You should apologise for that, and move on. It was a relatively minor mess up but a mess up just the same. ++
[Lar]: I agree with Phil here. I think you may have inadvertantly [[WP:BITE|bitten]] a newcomer. The last thing we want to do is turn an enthusiastic and well intentioned contributor into someone sour on our process who keeps their potential contributions to themselves because we've driven them away. The parkclearly exists, a google search reveals that, and it is clearly notable enough to merit inclusion. The article just needed some work, and instead of tagging, perhaps you could have worked with the user. I hope you find this feedback useful. Happy editing. ++
[Lar]: This seems a particularly inauspicious time to be undeleting things that were deleted for apparently valid BLP concerns. ++
[Lar]: Please keep conversations threaded per my talk page header,thanks. If you'd rather continue at my talk that is fine, let me know.  But all BLP is by definition, urgent, once discovered. Undeletion is just not ever a good idea without first understanding the issues. Which I see no sign you did, all you apparently did was undelete. Not on. ++
[Lar]: Holy smokes, you may want to reconsider remarks like this one: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ADeletion_review%2FLog%2F2007_May_31&diff=135170150&oldid=135157240] as they are totally unacceptable ways to make points. I cautioned you that undeletion of BLP related matters was not prudent. I cannot say it strongly enough, you must not reveal deleted content, it is a violation of the trust the community places in you. Please think long and hard before you apply for reinstatement++
[Lar]: Better safe than sorry. No harm done from a temporary thing like this if all is cleared up? Don't you agree Night Gyr? ++
[Lar]: Also, do you have any strong feeling about actually doing the switch and replacing the original Red Brigades derived flag with this one?... both you and I still have that one in our Rouge Admin badging :) ++
[Lar]: (refactored from my talk, I'll watch here for a bit) Well, the original red brigades one does come up for deletion\/kerfluffle-ing from time to time, as does the group itself... That's why I've thought that changing out the image with the star on it for this one was a good compromise. But no worries I guess. May as well let sleeping dogs lie. I think it's a fine change I guess, although I personally do prefer more cartoony skulls, that one looks rather sinister. So no I won't be reverting it. Thanks for the offer though, it's appreciated. ++
[Lar]: I am no Inkscape maven, that's for sure... but this image was a learning process for me. The original skull and bones image was made by intersecting\/unioning\/differencing shapes and twiddling paths, till I had a close approximation of the bitmapped image I was working from. Getting the text to follow a curved path was a bit challenging since you have to take spacing into account and you can't center it, only start somewhere... Perhaps I should dig up the bitmapped image and link to it in the description box. But since that version is now gone in this image, it doesn't matter. BTW, thanks for the tip on age, it's been done. {{tl|age}} does have the drawback of making your birthday obvious, but if I cared about that I shouldn't have added it to the esperanza calendar way back when :) ++
[Lar]: I added a couple of pics to the article, and a comment on the  talk, that she is named for McDougall's mentor might be worth a mention in the article, what do you think? ++
[Lar]: Thanks for your concern, IvoShandor. I'm an admin on Commons, familiar with licensing requirements, and I'm comfortable these images are going to be fine. Since this is a current DYK nom, it seemed a good idea to get the images into the article, as the capstan, however remarkable (and that Elkman went and got it himself... (did you use an underwater camera??) adds even more), doesn't really convey much information about the uniqueness of this ship and its design. ++
[Lar]: Your article inspired me... I did some tinkering with the [[whaleback]] article to tighten it up, as well as the [[SS Meteor]] and then pounded out [[Christopher Columbus (whaleback)]] ... hopefully two whaleback articles up at nearly the same time won't be too big a deal. I was always fond of whalebacks as a boy and had forgotten all about them. The Wilson went down not far from the place of her birth since she was built in Superior. My researches gave me enough material to do an article on McDougall and his company [[American Steel Barge Company]] as well, if I get inspired. And congrats on the barnstar, it's definitely earned. ++
[Lar]: Hi, please see [[User_talk:Concerniokw]], and [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard%2FIncidents&diff=158650693&oldid=158650336 this] AN\/I post. I'd ask you to strongly consider removing your comment. This is, in my considered judgement, and per checkuser investigation, a garden variety disruptive sock, part of a huge nest of basically vandalism only socks, not an aggrieved good faith contributor who needs an alternate ID to make important points anonymously. Thanks for your consideration. ++
[Lar]: Wow. Well done! Time flies when you're having fun, eh? ++
[Lar]: I'd have to think REALLY hard about that one, I reckon. But thanks for the vote of confidence. ++
[Lar]: Hi... I think you closed this keep but it seems like the AFD notice is still on the article. Did you mean to leave it for some reason? Thanks. ++
[Lar]: No worries. Coming here meant that I noticed my name mentioned, above... is that NOAA image thing all sorted then? ++
[Lar]: Congrats. I look forward to working with you here as well. ++
[Lar]: Are you still wanting to vanish? I'm confused. If you are, let us know and your pages can be deleted as you wish, but if you are not, please consider removing the threat to vandalize that is at the top of your page. If it's a threat you mean, then I'm not sure you fit in here, and if it's a threat you don't mean, I don't think it should remain. Just some friendly advice. ++
[Lar]: I'd just edit it away from the top of this page and that would be that. You can edit your own user and user talk pages, it's when you repeatedly delete warnings that some admins get concerned. Hope that helps. ++
[Lar]: Hi Mattisse. I have been requested ([[User_talk:Lar#Mattisse_and_mediation|at my talk page]]) to bring [[Wikipedia:Requests for mediation\/Caisson (Asian architecture)]] to your attention, since you have been named as a party. I was told that you were told about it already but may have overlooked it or inavertantly deleted it en masse. Typically it is considered polite to respond to such requests, even if your response is that you do not wish to participate. Would you be so kind as to take the time to respond at the page? You can respond in the section [[Wikipedia:Requests_for_mediation\/Caisson_%28Asian_architecture%29#Parties.27_agreement_to_mediate]]. I hope this has been helpful to you, happy editing.  (feel free to respond here if you want to discuss this with me, or at my talk page, as you like, but I may refactor to keep threads together)... ++
[Lar]: I saw you deleted quite a bit of text in [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Brian_Epstein&diff=prev&oldid=176791959 this] edit. I think maybe that ought to be taken to the talk page of the article? I didn't see why it was deleted in the edit summary... ++
[Lar]: No worries, makes sense to me. Recording it on the article talk page does sometimes help avoid random bystanders (<- me) from popping by and asking questions though. :) Happy editing. ... <small>count me in the \""''died laughing'' about your userid\"" column, by the way<\/small> ++
[Lar]: To elaborate this is called crosslinking...  Anyway you need to crosslink your account. You can do this by doing an edit here (to your user page, perhaps) saying you have an account on Meta named Crockspot, and then on Meta, giving the diff of that post (about the account) on en saying it is you on en. Or you can if you want set up a fullblown [[m:User:Lar\/WikiMatrix|WikiMatrix]] like my userpage on Meta references. (it's really best that it is something that one does for ones self). Once you do this it also counts for board elections.  ++
[Lar]: |} The guinea pigs having said this is good enough, I'm working my way through the A's ++
[Lar]: {{User:lar\/catmsg}} ...My guinea pigs and the \""A\""s having felt this message was OK to go forward with, today it's the turn of the \""B\""s and \""C\""s! I'm hoping at least one of you chaps will point to their own criteria instead of mine :)... it's flattering but scary! :) ++
[Lar]: |} ...My guinea pigs and the \""A\""s through \""H\""s having felt this message was OK to go forward with (or at least not complained bitterly to me about it :) ),  today it's the turn of the \""I\""s, \""J\""s,  and \""K\""s! I'm hoping that more of you chaps\/chapettes will point to their own criteria instead of mine :)... it's flattering but a bit scary! :) Also, you may want to check back to the table periodically, someone later than you in the alphabet may have come up with a nifty new idea. ++
[Lar]: Please DO get an official clarification on this before making the request at meta, so that whatever steward handles the request is not put in the position of having to decide if you \""really mean it\"" or not, or if they don't know about the clause, turn you off and then you perhaps later turn up and ask a 'crat for it back because you decided you didn't get the clause you seek. I hope that's clear :)... (I won't be the steward handling the request, this being one of my home wikis) ++
[Lar]: I think this motion resolves the ambiguity that would have given a steward pause in accepting a request from you that was conditionally worded. For reference, you can ask for permission removal at  [[m:Requests_for_permissions]]. You will need to provide crosslinking to identify and validate yourself, filling out and using the template at the top of the page to set up your request will do it for you. (a statement here on your own talk page that you are doing the request on meta would suffice as the \""local request link\"" that you need to give the diff of over there) Please advise if that is not clear or if I can be of any assistance. ++
[Lar]: Done by [[m:user:DerHexer]] 16:05, 14 January 2008 (UTC) - [http:\/\/meta.wikimedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Requests_for_permissions&diff=834298&oldid=834291 diff] ... You have my compliments for having resolved this in a much more seemly and gracious manner than I feared would be the case. Best wishes. ++
[Lar]: I'd appreciate your not repeating that tagging, because I agree with A. B., tagging active pages as historical is indeed likely to be viewed as disruption by more than one admin. ++
[Lar]: Hi, I noticed you are archiving some of this year's discussion. Thanks for that! Do you think you might be able to also create archived versions of the AFMP? I think someone did so for last year but this years is now gone, near as I can tell. Unless I was looking in the wrong place. I'm thinking that since this is now a 3 year old tradition, an archive structure that didn't just use the standard archive box might be better ... some sort of embedded template that all the talk pages carry that shows, by year, the main page, the main page talk, the DYK talk pate, the FA talk page, etc. It might be a bit much to do but might also avoid some rediscovery\/reinvention each year. I noticed this because my blog link to yesterday's main page is already stale and I was trying to find what to link to... what do you think? ++
[Lar]: K! Did. Thx. ++
[Lar]: Note that one red link from the deletion of [[Wikipedia:Verifiability]] is on every single edit page... oh I think you just fixed it. :) Seeing red THERE made me do a double take! ++
[Lar]: I blame you (and moreso our move vandal, I just closed his AfD nom for him) for the database locks just now, that page is referenced from a gazillion places ... :) ++
[Lar]: FYI I ran a check as part of trying to close the AfD. I updated the report, you may want to review it. ++
[Lar]: I strongly prefer leaving convos in one place... you strongly prefer them not... I want to let you know I goofed, please check that page again, it doesn't say what it used to at all ! ( :( at me for goofing). As for the other IP you pointed out, I did check it.  It's not technically correlated to either of the IDs, just as they are not correlated to each other. But the editing pattern supports assuming association... as with the others. Let's keep this convo here, I'll watchlist your page for a while. ++
[Lar]: (as a side note, redirecting the talk to the user page makes things (1 click) harder for CUs, as it suppresses the list of handy links on the talk page which are very useful...) ++
[Lar]: If the pattern is strong, treat as a meatpuppet rather than a sock. This case, someone using different connections and machines would fit the observed stuff returned by CU, as would multiple people. I think the blocks probably are sound enough. You might offer to unblock the main account on a committment to not repeat the behaviour pattern. ++
[Lar]: I am glad to see your editing privs restored. ++
[Lar]: Done. Thank you for your contributions, and best wishes. ++
[Lar]: Thanks. ++
[Lar]: If you mean me, I calls them like I sees them. [[WP:DUCK]] doesn't only apply to socks, you know. ++
[Lar]: Ya, I think that one speaks for itself. This isn't PoT. PoT said no other sock will be used when he needs to speak for himself. Near as I can tell (and as you know from reading the pages yourself) PoT is not seeking mentorship, either. Just peaceful editing far away from policy pages. ++
[Lar]: I sincerely hope that Ncmvocalist is not allowed to clerk anything related to ArbCom. I do not think his approach is suited to the task, and some of the things done already by Ncmvocalist have been, in my view, rather counter productive... (in particular \""pestering\"" arbs is not what is needed...)  If there is a better place to give this input please advise and I will do so. ++
[Lar]: You raise some important issues, and highlight some serious problems, but your message might be lost in among the rhetoric, you know, inflammatory statements like \""kiss my ass\"", \""looking idiotic\"", calling ''me'' \""level-headed\"", terming someone \""colossally prejudiced\"", and mentioning \""wheel-war his stupid ass\"" as a good idea... you might want to see if you can refactor this a bit. And maybe take a break for a bit... there are lots of other things to do in life, and clearing your head might help. Or come over to Commons more often.  ++
[Lar]: I think you both are edit warring on this article. Please review [[WP:3RR|the three revert rule]] and remember it is a bright line, not an entitlement. I am warning both parties. ++
[Lar]: Just as a note, in the recent case I was in, although a party not named did share presentations with me, I never saw anything evidentiary at all from the other named party. Nothing. Which is odd since that party was the one making the accusations. That party has made rather a large statement about how they never saw anything at all, but cast in a way that makes the problem seem one sided. It was not a one sided problem at all in that case. Your suggestion on how to do these sorts of cases seems exceedingly sound. ++
[Lar]: Sehr Gut! Viele Gl\xfcck! ++
[Lar]: Mattisse... edits like [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Medicine&diff=260598845&oldid=260598412 this one] just are not good. Not what we expect from seasoned contributors. Way too blatantly assuming bad faith and needling a fellow contributor. I've not followed your contributions closely but I'm not liking what I've seen... as I commented at Che, your approach may not be suitable. At all. I think you need to revisit it. ++
[Lar]: I am pretty busy myself. So you can assume that if I left you a message, I felt \""this issue is so important that it warrants a message to\"" [you] \""from\"" [me]... As far as \""following around and accusing of underhanded dealings\"" goes, I think you've the wrong end of the stick. My suggestion is that you stop needling people and stop assuming bad faith. ++
[Lar]: I think focusing on how to improve your own interactions with others, rather than worrying about others, or about Wikipedia in general, or how I choose to spend my time, or what brings matters to my attention, would be the best use of your time. ++
[Lar]: I'm concerned about the ''pattern of behaviour'' not just the particular edit. That edit is one example of many. Again, focus on your own behaviour instead of attacking all and sundry unless they 100% agree with you, and instead of seeking conspiracies and the like. ++
[Lar]: I was just popping in here to speak to you about another article that I think you may have closed a bit early. I would just ask you to give the matter serious thought and if there is any dissent whatever, don't SNOW close things. ++
[Lar]: OK good deal. I'm not even going to mention the article, that's not the point, although I guess I could... just do think. 'nuff said, best wishes. ++
[Lar]: You got a response. Issues #1 and #2 of Icestorm815's list are being discussed already, I hope you both will join in the discussion of them (and the rest too). ++
[Lar]: Just to follow up, I removed the permission (Heather hasn't been editing since November 2008), but if you disagree with that feel free to ask me to put it back or do so yourself. ++
[Lar]: I suggest you not revert that addition again. This has been raised at AN and AN\/I. I'm not uninvolved but I imagine there are plenty of uninvolved admins who would be willing to block you for edit warring if you did. ++
[Lar]: The antidote to insularity is wider participation. I think the better place to start seeking fresh eyes is on the guidelines themselves rather than the debates, but ya... glad to. Time permitting, of course. (Most of my en:wp time today was spent CUing). ++
[Lar]: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArbitration%2FRequests%2FCase&diff=311321581&oldid=311320689] :) (although I undid mine, not knowing you'd added yours, thinking mine not that funny, perhaps I should re-revert myself and then block myself for edit warring?... but I digress)  That is a very odd page indeed... we actually have page titles that start with http:\/\/ ??? and whats more, that page gets views? ++
[Lar]: You need to work on your [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAitias&diff=312575103&oldid=312516588 edit summaries]. I was giving friendly advice, hoping for a collegial conversation, but if you want we can move to warnings, up to you. Because you're on a bad path. ++
[Lar]: OK then, have it your way, going forward, I'll only come by when I feel the need to warn you about something, or let you know you've been blocked. Try to manage your affairs so I never feel the need to come by. Best wishes. ++
[Lar]: Ottava: Suppose for the sake of argument that Antandrus is part of a massive conspiracy with the single focus of making your life miserable in every way possible. Guess what? He's still right about your approach being not the best. If you change your approach, things will go a lot more smoothly for you. You're an amazing contributor, with an astounding ability to get things done. But that's in spite of your working style, not because of it. Think how much more productive you'd be if people clamored to spend time with you instead of cringed when you appeared, but put up with it for the sake of getting work done. Take that for what you like. ++
[Lar]: Congratulations. I've taken a final pass through and promoted the article [[Laguna Canyon]] to [[WP:GA|Good Article]] status. It was a \""good article\"" when we started and now it's ''great''! I had a couple more suggestions but that's all they are, suggestions. Thanks for all your efforts on this (and other) article(s). I know it took us a while but I think the delay was well worth it. Good luck in your future endeavors, I hope we get to work together again, it's been a pleasure. Best wishes. ++
[Lar]: Have things changed a lot on starting projects? I wasn't aware admin consent was required. When [[User:Kingboyk|Kingboyk]] and I started [[WP:BEATLES]] neither of us were admins. Anyway I've voiced my support. ++
[Lar]: I know what the guidelines say... but one of my earliest GA noms was quickfailed when those of us working on it were sure it could be fixed in a week. Much acrimony ensued. I'll never fail an article for time reasons if I think the editor(s) are working on it, however slowly. But don't count on other GA reviewers feeling that way. I dabble, at best, and it may be explicitly counter-policy to be patient, not sure. Best. ++
[Lar]: I agree, it is wheel warring. Ask ArbCom for an injunction to support the block, if you're sure you are right. ++
[Lar]: Thank you. ++
[Lar]: Do you consider yourself an \""uninvolved admin\"" with respect to [[WP:GS\/CC\/RE]]? ++
[Lar]: The question is specific enough without reference to any particular ''section'' of that page, and admits of a yes or no answer as posed. ++
[Lar]: We are all of us going to be \""involved\"" in whatever specific discussion we are having, so perhaps it's sophistry to point it out. However, with respect to that particular one, if I'm asking neutral questions, and you're advocating a particular point of view, you're far more involved, even under your own peculiar definition, than I am.  That said, the question is about the topic area as a whole. Please confine your answer to the question asked, if you would be so kind. Sorry if that was unclear. As it happens I have already made my own determination of the matter and acted, but the question is nevetheless of interest ++
[Lar]: Ok, then. You may take that view if you wish but the question admits of a direct yes or no answer, unlike your rhetorical dodge. They are not equivalent. Your repeated refusal to answer a simple yes or no question with a \""yes\"" or \""no\"" is all I need though, the answer is plain enough from your refusal, and I adjudge you to not be an \""uninvolved admin\"" within the scope of the topic area. Going forward any comments by you in the \""result concerning...\"" section of any enforcement request are subject to removal to the section immediately above them, as I have recently done with \""Result concerning ZP5, AQFK, ATren\"". You are welcome to challenge that determination, in the proper form and manner, should you so choose. However you are not welcome to unilaterally move things back or to post in that or any other similar section again. ++
[Lar]: It is my view as an uninvolved admin. You are welcome to contest it, in the proper forum, but I intend to act on it as I see fit. In accordance with our norms. The \""topic area\"" is the entire area covered by the [[Wikipedia:General sanctions\/Climate change probation]] in accordance with the definition currently in effect there. I'm not seeing much more to say here given your unwillingness to engage in meaningful dialog. ++
[Lar]: Don't worry SBHB, I don't rise to bait like [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:William_M._Connolley&diff=next&oldid=353779930]. Or were you worried about something else? You need to change your approach. You all do. ++
[Lar]: Apologies for any confusion. I thought you were perhaps raising material that SBHB then correctly characterized as ''baiting '''by''' Stephan Schulz''. Why would I think that? On the face of it, those posts by him look like baiting to me! That's why.  So I would HOPE SBHB would warn Stephan Schulz about it and urge him to desist. It's excellent advice.  But perhaps that's not what SBHB was doing. Perhaps he was egging him on. Can't be sure. ++
[Lar]: I think you may be confused, and a careful reread may help clear that up. The diffs show baiting BY Stephan, and SBHB does sometimes speak in riddles. Also, I don't believe that Stephan wants to be called SS. Hope that helps. ++
[Lar]: I'm happy to further discuss my perceived bias. (on my talk page, not here) I'd think a good starting point would be for you, Stephan Schulz, to articulate ''exactly'' what you think it is. Be specific. But I find myself in agreement with ATren, I'm less involved in editing in the area itself (i.e. essentially zero edits) than several of the other admins who are active at the enforcement page, and who I consider uninvolved, and I am less active. My role so far has been purely commentary and clerical, I don't believe I've actually blocked anyone yet. I think you (and SBHB, and WMC, and others) need to stop the snark. If you want to pursue the matter further after the discussion about bias I propose, I'm [[User:Lar\/Accountability|recallable]]. But please stop the snark. It's just not helpful. ++
[Lar]: Assumes facts not in evidence.  I'm happy to further discuss my perceived bias. (on my talk page, not here) ++
[Lar]: I see this isn't going very well as conversations go. I appreciate your barnstar. I appreciate your desire to bring WMC to account for snarking about it. But I must caution you that we do give editors wide latitude on their own pages and if WMC tells you you're not welcome, you're not. The only allowable exception under policy to that is if you are giving routine notifications or warnings and there is reason for them. So, I'd say just let it go. Trust me, it will work out better. Playing the martyr (\""I don't care if I'm blocked\"") is way overrated. If you really feel the need to comment and just can't resist, you can always find a talk page where the owner doesn't sweep things under the rug willy nilly and doesn't tell people he takes a dislike to that they have to go away, and comment there instead... if you pick the right page you'll find that your message gets through anyway. But taking the high road is the better approach. Easy advice to give. Hard advice to take. Hope it helps though. ++
[Lar]: They were interesting answers indeed. But I was referring to the question that starts out \""Ah. Thanks for clarifying. I think I see the source of the confusion... \"" ++
[Lar]: That's rather a novel interpretation. Stop playing games. Place, or move back, a comment of yours in the uninvolved admin section, or move one of mine out, and there will be consequences. ++
[Lar]: I don't edit in the topic area. And my constructive Wikipedia contributions are somewhat shorter at only 5 or so years. But other than that we're the same, yes. However, editing in the topic area is what matters. Stephan Schulz does edit there, I do not. Further, the other uninvolved admins find me uninvolved. They do not find Stephan Schulz uninvolved. ++
[Lar]: I'm uninvolved. He's not. The determination of this has been made, so far, by the uninvolved admins. Perhaps that will change. I suppose I could ask ArbCom for a ruling on it. ++
[Lar]: It's been mine all along. Some don't like that. Hence their machinations. I'd say it looks like one team trying to remove a ref they don't like because he's too impartial for their taste. ++
[Lar]: Get your request ready, then. The other uninvolved admins find me uninvolved and have said so repeatedly. That should do for you. I have no plans to stop participating as an uninvolved admin. You can't take me out of the game with this ploy. ++
[Lar]: No, you've misunderstood me. I'm uninvolved. The other uninvolved admins agree. You need to get over it. Don't interfere with the working of the board, because THAT is disruption. But this probably belongs on my talk, as I came here to warn Stephan, not debate you. ++
[Lar]: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk%3AWilliam_M._Connolley&action=historysubmit&diff=364466825&oldid=364446772 This] was a good comment, I think. ++

[Lar]: I need to do better at noting positive things. But you may well want to start thinking about who actually is ruder and taking the appropriate level of action instead of demurring from taking a stance. ++
[Lar]: I need to do better at noting positive things. But you may well want to start thinking about who actually is ruder and taking the appropriate level of action instead of demurring from taking a stance. ++
[Lar]: You were mentioned on same, toward the bottom. Seems to be regarding this diff: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Collect&diff=prev&oldid=366181125]. I just got up after a very late flight and an unplanned 2.5 hour drive home and am not sure what it's all about. Just thought you might want to know. ++
[Lar]: I'm not sure badgering Stephan is a good approach. A sockpuppet investigation is not like a murder investigation, and the standards of evidence are much lower. ++
[Lar]: Polargeo, I'm not sure you're being very helpful here either. It may be a better approach to try being a bit less blustery. Better, could we all just take the point that small sample phrase correlation isn't always accurate and drop this? ++
[Lar]: Unless I am much mistaken, I'm not sure you're at all clear on what point Collect is actually trying to make here. It has little or nothing to do with statistics, and your repeated reference to stats suggests you've failed to grasp that. But as I said, I think the point has already been made, ''more'' than adequately, and at this point nothing useful is being added. At least not directly useful anyway, although lots of interesting diffs are being generated. So I suggest it be dropped and everyone move on. ++
[Lar]: Full marks for trying. Thanks. ++
[Lar]: Please also note my request at the end of [[Wikipedia_talk:Arbitration\/Requests\/Case\/Climate_change\/Workshop#Note:_Connolley_has_violated_the_terms_one_of_his_probations_yet_again]]... BTW, do you prefer the no caps version of your userid (which is what it is) or the version with CamelCase (which is how you sign)? Thanks. ++
[Lar]: As would I. This entire conversation is an excellent illustration of the many problems with this faction. When one person is asked to explain or answer, others join in and evade, then take umbrage on being called on that. Simple questions, put directly, are answered with evasion over and over, and attacks on the questioner thrown in for good measure. StS, you say you have several alternate explanations. Put some forward then. WMC, why are you unwilling to answer the questions asked you directly? Do you think no one notices your tactics? ++
[Lar]: Accusing me of being in a faction with \""Scibaby\""? That needs redaction, soonest. ++
[Lar]: You need to include a smiley or some other marker. Given that you don't seem to have any ability for accepting humor, that's the least that can be expected. I nevertheless expect a redaction, or at least clarifying remark, at my talk. ++
[Lar]: I've started a thread here: [[Wikipedia_talk:General_sanctions\/Climate_change_probation\/Requests_for_enforcement#Unilateral_modification_of_active_sanction]]. I think it would be better to gain consensus for such a modification. It may well be that consensus exists. But if we modify that way based on principle, there are other sanctions that may need modification as well. So I invite you to discuss this. ++

[Lar]: With respect, ANI is the audience with a larger number of inexperienced and non admin participants. Seeking consensus at GSCC is the right thing to do. I suggest you do so. Because, with respect, I don't see the consensus at ANI that you claim to. It may well be that consensus exists, but so far you haven't shown it. ++

[Lar]: (moved from the PD talk page, better suited here) ''\""Lar, have you ever written a proposed decision for an arbitration case?\"", \""Without exception, those participating in a case see their case as THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ARBCOM HAVE TO DEAL WITH (tm). \""'' ... those both were ''completely'' uncalled for remarks, in my view, so I rebutted them.  Sorry if you didn't like the smackdown, but you were ''pwned''. I'll stop trying to score debating points on you if you do the same for me. You first. ++
[Lar]: Take a pass through the last 8 months of my user talk some time if you want to see antagonism. It's been a constant incoming barrage. I'm just tired of it all. Tired of that faction and their continued passive aggressive (or outright aggressive) behavior, and how it's colored my own. Fight against something long enough and you run the danger of turning into it. Maybe I'm doing myself no favors by being so caustic, but I really have about had it. How many more messengers get shot before the message gets across? You guys just do not seem to get it yet. Instead you rag on me too. ++
[Lar]: Thanks for reading it. As a note, there is an important difference between explaining factors behind behavior, and claiming an excuse for it. I've explained, but I'm not claiming that it's OK that I lose my temper or act in ways that are not exemplary. In fact I regret it and I would prefer to do better. Hal peridol might take note of that, as that's an important distinction to aid him in his apparent confusion. ++
[Lar]: I'm not sure exactly what the fix is, but this system isn't working, and it's worse in this case than many. Arbs should have used the workshop page like everyone else instead of closing it for a month, then proposing stuff without a proper vehicle for give and take. The older way in which the workshop wasn't segregated by originator may be better... segregate the proposals by topic instead. Then arbs can move the ones they truly are ready to vote on to the PD page. ++
[Lar]: Your questions have been answered. I'm interested in your thoughts, as well as those of others and now that I've answered, would like to invite comment by others. It's odd that these questions were asked on the PD page... they seem much more workshoppy. ++
[Lar]: Way to go Dana... you passed with nary a neigh vote. Er, I mean nay vote. Now get to work! ++
[Lar]: Although the remedy \""Lar is an uninvolved admin but advised\"" looks likely to fail at this point (but that could change, who knows), I do plan to (as Carcharoth suggests) take the advice given on board, and step aside to let other admins try to resolve this matter. I am dubious whether this will work out well, since the decision fails to meaningfully acknowledge or tackle the factionalism and skewed battlefield, and leaves a lot of the worst participants unmentioned, much less advised, but I am going to give it a rest and see what happens. ++
[Lar]: The case isn't over, Tony. There are still proposals being made. Asking someone to not participate in the case isn't reasonable if they are possibly going to be impacted by it. Wait till the case is put to bed and if you still see worrisome behavior, speak out then. Make sure you're speaking out about all the problems you see and not just those on one side though. ++
[Lar]: On the contrary it's very good advice to everyone involved... speak out about all problems you see and not just those on one side. Is there some reason you disagree? ++
[Lar]: Yes, I agree my comments are pertinent. So are yours and so are those of many others. I'm not sure where you were going with that. ++
[Lar]: I hope that's everyone else's reading too. A fresh approach by fresh folk is needed. ++
[Lar]: I've deleted it for you, ATren. Please advise of any questions or concerns. ++
[Lar]: I think your avenues to seek redress are with the volunteer coordinator(s) and the WMF board. ++
[Lar]: Contacting the volunteer coordinator to ask about something is not at all a high bar, in my view. It's a pretty routine action. Or used to be. As for resigning, the thought has crossed my mind, yes. ++
[Lar]: IIRC \""another day on the wiki\"" was the phrasing Jimbo used when this was first brought to him. ++
[Lar]: Hi. Best of luck in your upcoming trial by fire. As in [[Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2008\/Candidate_statements\/Questions\/General#Questions_from_Lar|previous]] [[User:Lar\/ACE2009\/Questions|years]] I have a [[User:Lar\/ACE2010\/Questions|series of questions]] I ask candidates. This year there are restrictions on the length and number of questions on the \""official\"" page for questions, restrictions which I do not agree with, but which I will abide by. I nevertheless think my questions are important and relevant (and I am not the only person to think so, in previous years they have drawn favorable comment from many, including in at least one case indepth analysis of candidates answers to them by third parties). You are invited to answer them if you so choose. I suggest that the talk page of your questions page is a good place to put them and I will do so with your acquiescence (for example, SirFozzie's [[Wikipedia_talk:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2010\/Candidates\/SirFozzie\/Questions#Questions_from_Lar|page]] already has them as do the majority of other candidates). Your answers, (or non-answers should you decide not to answer them), that will be a factor in [[User:Lar\/ACE2010|my evaluation]] of your candidacy. Please let me know as soon as practical what your wish is. Thanks and best of luck. (please answer here, I'll see it, and it keeps things together better) ++

[Lar]: Were you planning on responding to this? ++
[Lar]: Were you planning on responding to this? ++
[Lar]: Probably moot at this point but Bali's right and WSC's off the mark giving him a hard time. IMHO. ++
[Lar]: Since the section \""NPA on an article talk page\"" does read like a personal attack to me, or presumably to anyone at all that doesn't have context, I've removed it. I've also written ArbCom as you suggest. If they answer in a way that suggests that your section should be allowed to remain, I'll gladly restore it. Otherwise I suggest you leave it removed until the matter is resolved. Thanks for your understanding and cooperation as we endeavor to keep this a civil and friendly environment. ++
[Lar]: PS, write me if you would like me to forward you a copy of what I sent to ArbCom for your records. ++
[Lar]: I'm not angry with you. I just think you are exceedingly confused and your comments often don't help matters in the slightest. Hence I think if you're doing more harm than good, you ought to step away. ... a lot of people ought to. You're not as bad as jps who is totally out of control lately but still... As a note, that input wasn't a \""lash out at random\""... Mathsci is a bit confused too.  If you want to continue this discussion I recommend my talk page, where comments don't get censored or removed if they're inconvenient. ++
[Lar]: As for SBHB taking up the admin bit again? I don't think that's a good idea at all. Perhaps after SBHB goes a few months without snarking? ++
[Lar]: You guys are so predictable. :) ++
[Lar]: Many Happy Returns! ++
[Lar]: I see you are in [[CAT:AOTR]], but it appears that you may be inadvertantly listed. That may be because the only page of yours that carries the category is [[User talk:Trebor\/archive3]]. Having a category membership only on an archive page is perhaps a bit odd, so I would like to ask if that what you intended? Or did you intend not to be in it at all? I let folk know when I spot things like this because some folk use the number of category entries to count the number of admins actually so committed. Cheers. ++"
Khosrow II,False,"[Khosrow II]: Im just sick and tired of these anon users making ridiculous and useless edits! chances are they will never become constructive. WIkipedia should make everyone have to register before editing, that will definetly take care of people who just want to mess things up.
[Khosrow II]: [[User:Baristarim]] continually attacks pages without reason, and along with his other pan Turk friends tries to push propaganda and POV on several articles. He is currently attack the Iranian's notice board page, claiming its a place where we recruit \""meat puppets\"" where infact it is a place where we can post articles that are in urgent need of attention, such as the Ottoman Empire article where him and his friend claim that Persian and Arabic cultures had no affect, where infact, its exactly the opposite (see talk page). Please do something about this user.
[Khosrow II]: Please tell that to the other User, he blatantly is ignoring Inshahee's warning.
[Khosrow II]: Are you kidding me? I was not even the first to call you a pan Turk. It was evident by your edits that you have some agenda. Its funny that you also dont debate with sources, just your POV. You were proven wrong on several occasions yet you still refuse to understand that things are based on facts, not POV. You go as far as saying that the University of Texas is not a reliable source. And the Culture of the Ottoman empire is as the title says, '''about the culture''', yet you want to take out all references to Arabic and Iranian culture, which made up the culture of the Ottoman Empire.
[Khosrow II]: As I said, I would come to you first. Look at this: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Azerbaijan_Democratic_Republic&action=history] User Baristarim removed a whole sourced section, which also had a link to the main article, which was even more sourced. I will be reverting it, and now you know why, so talk to Baristarim. I have re inserted it now, added more to it, and neutralized it according to the talk on the discussion page of the main page of the article.
[Khosrow II]: Again, he reverted on another article: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=List_of_Azerbaijanis&curid=774820&diff=80742801&oldid=80735918] The term Azerbaijani was not even in use until the late 19th century, when the Russians started using it to seperate a sect of Turkic speakers that were of Iranian descent. The three figures he insists on keeping in lived about 1000 years before, therefore they could not have been Azeri. Also, they were Persians at the time, since the region had not yet been Turkified.
[Khosrow II]: He reverted again, even though I made changes... I also left a message on his talk page. Also, I hope he does not revert again, but if he does, I'll let you take care of it (I already reverted once on accident LOL).
[Khosrow II]: Interesting, he reverted my message on his talk page: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Baristarim&diff=prev&oldid=80752111].
[Khosrow II]: Im not giving you orders. Remember I told you that from now on I will show you all of my edits and what is going on, this is what I'm doing. This way, we can avoid revert wars and arguments before they happen. Also, as I told you, the term Azerbaijani is only a little bit more than 100 years old. Certainly we cannot call 1000 year old figures as Azeri's, and we definetly cannot call them Azeri's from the R. of Azerbaijan since they were all born in Iran. Thats like calling [[Avicenna]] Uzbek...
[Khosrow II]: Thanks for reverting yourself, but it still amazes me why you would just blatantly revert like that, taking out a whole section that was sourced. Even if you had a problem with it, you could have made it more neutral. But as of now, I have made it more neutral according to the agreement me, Ali, and Grandmaster have come to on the main article's talk page.
[Khosrow II]: And the other souces does not come from the \""Iranian Chamber of Commerce\"" LOL. Its the Iranian Chamber Society. A very reliable source for information on Iran. Besides, its just an interview with a historian about the subject, who also scites his sources.
[Khosrow II]: I wrote ''in'' his edit? What do you mean? I wrote under him. Thanks.
[Khosrow II]: What? He wrote that. Check my edit history. This is what I'm talking about. You seem to have this pre conceived notion about me, I dont know where you even got it from: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASarah_Ewart&diff=80754146&oldid=80753594] He wrote that in hismelf. Please be more observant next time, I dont want to be blamed for things I didnt do. Also, I want to know why you even assumed it was me that did that when it was obviously part of his own message that he wrote?
[Khosrow II]: Its not about what Turkey can do on its own or not, its about what [[Mossad]] is doing in Turkey and norther Iraq. Also, please post some historian e-mail addresses. By the way, the .edu and .org ones are if a historian works for a university or some other organization. Dr. Kaveh Farrokh does not work for either, he is independent as far as I know. He writes books and contributes to historical lectures, etc... Right now, I have an .edu e-mail because I got to a university, does that mean I'm important? No. University e-mails are just like AOL or Yahoo, there is no difference. I still use my Yahoo e-mail as well as my university e-mail. I take no special pride in either one, its just an e-mail address. I dont even know what your talking about, its pretty ludicrous.
[Khosrow II]: Also, I will let you know right now that me, Ali, and Grandmaster have already come to a conclusion and a neutral version of the History of the name Azerbaijan article after literally weeks (if not a couple months) of discussion. The last thing the article needs is a new editor who is not familiar with the extent of the discussion we had. Look at the talk page, unless you want to read all of that, its best to leave it as it is.
[Khosrow II]: It probably is a bug, for me it doesnt not appear as it does for you, and I did not add that sentence, he did himself. Also, when did I say you or anyone else cant edit anything? I merely suggested to Baristarim not to jump into a discussion about an article that has been going on for over a month. We have right now come to a conclusion that satisfies all sides, we have stopped edit warring, and we have stopped revert warring. The last thing needed now is for a user unfamiliar with the subject to restart the edit warring, do you know what I mean? I'm merely telling Baristarim that we have already discussed that article and gotten the dispute over with. Im even inclinded to say that it may even acheive featured status. Anyway, I'm going to sleep. I think this idea I have come up with is a really good idea, and it has already prevented several edit wars. Thanks for your help. I'll be keepin in touch like this again.
[Khosrow II]: He says that it is spamming and that its repetitive. Its a summarized section leading to the main article, and it is ownly posted where it is relevant, I dont see anything wrong with it, do you? Its just like how the Azerbaijan article has sections that link to other pages, you know? I think Grandmaster is just trying to keep this information out, thats what it looks like doesnt it? Please, I dont want a revert war, take a look.
[Khosrow II]: Also, the same user reinserted those three figures here: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=List_of_Azerbaijanis&diff=80763370&oldid=80755224] He says that this is not about ethnicity but people who were born in the region. In that case, Sitting Bull was American (as in USA), Montezuma (Aztec King) was Mexican, [[Avicenna]] was Uzbek etc... Hes not making any sense. Also, the R. of Azerbaijan did not even exist at any time in history until 1918, so the region he is referring to, didnt technically exist 1000 then (Becuase the regions origional name was changed for political purposes [see here: [[History of the name Azerbaijan]]], and therefore, them having lived 1000 years before, would not even make them candidates for a list like that).
[Khosrow II]: Hes done it again. Now you are my witness, and I'm showing you who has started the revert war (so dont think its me, like you did the other times). He once again took out the sourced section: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Azerbaijan_Democratic_Republic&diff=80952624&oldid=80952154]\/[http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Azerbaijan&curid=746&diff=80952746&oldid=80952498] and he refuses to talk about why, he just says its POV, despite the fact that its based on the consensus version of the main article which he was involved in making. You can even see for yourself the changes I made to that section to make it neutral according to the main article.
[Khosrow II]: I never said there was consensus on putting the article in relevant sections, I said there was consensus on the article itself, adn therefore the summary, which is in agreement with the main article. And what is wrong with putting in relevant information on relevant articles? And please tell me what is POV about the summary. Why dont you fix the \""POV\"" instead of deleting the whole section? Everything I have ever put in wikipedia is sourced. You have a habit of claiming things as POV and then not mentioned what things your talking about, and also not bringing up the facts to contradict the \""POV\"". Ali Doostzadeh is also complainging about the way you edit wikipedia.
[Khosrow II]: I will be going to sleep now, so I ask that the admins not make a decision until I can come back and make a better case tomorrow (as I believe GM and I are in different time zones, he has the opportunity right now to bring up his case, while I do not). In the mean time, I ask that you read the main article and the summary, and decide for yourself whether they are in agreement or not (now I remind you that the main article is a consensus version acheived with GM's participation). Also, I urge you to consider that the Azerbaijan and ADR articles are relevant places to post this information. I'll say good night for now and I will talk to you tomorrow. Thanks adn I hope you are able to resolve this dispute. For now however, since the sections are sourced, I think they should stay in the respective articles until a final decision is made.
[Khosrow II]: Thanks. Also, could you tell me how to arhive? About the list of Azerbaijani's article, User's like Grandmaster keep reverting everytime me or Ali or someone else changes the intro...
[Khosrow II]: I already showed you the Iranica link that clearly states that those numbers are worthless.
[Khosrow II]: Since this is about Dunn, I would also like to make a complaint. We were debating on another talk page and he just splices my posts and adds his words in between. I keep telling him that its not ok to cut peoples posts with yours and that he should post under other peoples posts. He insists that I shouldnt \""lecture\"" him, but this is what you yourself told me Sarah. I'm also asking him to change his post but he refuses. This may be the same as the case mentioned above.
[Khosrow II]: This is on another talk page, just thought I'd mention it.
[Khosrow II]: This is GM's tactic. He starts revert wars citing ludicrous reasons. Ignores discussions on talk pages as much as he can. Then goes to admins to get pages locked. Please unblock these pages. Thanks.
[Khosrow II]: Thanks for your help, but more and more it becomes evident why Wikipedia is not a very reliable source for information...its sad that such a great thing has such big faults.
[Khosrow II]: Is it ok for people on English Wikipedia to speak in a different language about other User's and topics? (two user's are talking about me and certain articles, and I dont think its ok for them to be doing this)
[Khosrow II]: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMardavich&diff=81974282&oldid=81522878] and [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk%3AGrandmaster&diff=81959948&oldid=81736383].
[Khosrow II]: More disruptive behaviour by GM. In one discussion page, he claims that Brittanica should have the final say in all matters, saying that Brittanica cannot possibly be influenced by outside forces and that it can never make mistakes, etc... Yet he has currently removed sourced information from Brittanica from several articles: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Erivan_Khanate&diff=prev&oldid=82803739] [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Karabakh_khanate&diff=prev&oldid=82804090] [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Ganja_Khanate&diff=prev&oldid=82804538] [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Baku_Khanate&diff=prev&oldid=82805140] This goes to further prove GM's double standard on Wikipedia, certainly an aspect of his POV, and his disruptive behaviour. Also, I will note that GM was pushing several negative quotes that about Iran and when I found the exact same type of quotes about the R. of Azerbaijan (these quotes were regarding assimilation of ethnic minorities, in Irans case in the 1920's abd 30's, in Azerbaijani's case the USSR period and present-day) and put them within articles, he quickly came up with a compromise with Ali to just have none of the quotes mentioned at all, saying that the quotes \""made Azerbaijan look bad\"". Double standard? I think so.
[Khosrow II]: It has just come to my knowledge that GM has been purposely manipulation Brittanica quotes for his own means. Brittanica never says what GM has been claiming it says and using as evidence. I have read the actual text. This is disruptive behaviour, he has purposely been manipulating Brittanica and distorting what it says; this would be classified under historical revisionism and propaganda, but I will leave the decision up to you, since you are an admin, as to what step I should take next regarding GM's behaviour.
[Khosrow II]: Ok sure. I only have access to the regular online version, and from what I read there, Brittanica says nothing that GM claims it says. Thanks for the help.
[Khosrow II]: You are very welcome and I'm the one that should be thanking you. Without your help I probably would have made the same mistakes as before.
[Khosrow II]: Just tell me when we should start talking about the two article and I will write up my comments.
[Khosrow II]: Sure, thats fine with me. Also, are we allowed to comment on the comments section? Because you mentioned something about having other secondary sources, I just want to say that that is exactly what I have done. I have even researched medieval texts written hundreds of years ago to bring up some of the evidence I use. I do not only rely on Brittanica or Iranica or Encarta or what ever, I myself prefer information from before the 20th century, becuase the 20th century has been too greatly influenced by politics and natoinalism to find any real accurate information.
[Khosrow II]: Where do we go from here? GM has been gone for awhile, we cant just wait around forever for him to show up, he may not be back for awhile longer, and who knows, maybe hes purposely inactive for all we know. I think the case has already been made crystal clear on EL_C's talk page. GM doesnt really even have a case, I already met everything he asked for and more, he is just filibustering. THe page has already been locked for more than a week... and I've waited for a decision from El_C for more than a week (hes busy), and this really shouldnt be taking this long for us to finish this.
[Khosrow II]: No, admin [[User:Srikeit|Srikeit]] locked the [[Azerbaijan]] and  [[List of Azerbaijanis]] on GM's versions. I think I have made my case very very clear, and as you can see on El_C's talk page, GM did nothing but filibuster, he couldnt even make a case, all he did was repeat himself over and over again (hes very disruptive, he does this stuff a lot). Have you read El_C's talk page? There is no way that a person could be so busy that they cannot even reply to an e-mail. I check my e-mail several times a day, even at school, and still make time to reply.
[Khosrow II]: Urgent! GM is once again starting an edit war here: [[History of the name Azerbaijan]]. He is trying to push his POV while at the same time saying my edits are POV. I dont have time now, but I will explain everything later, but for now, in confidence of good will in me, could you please lock the article on my last version until we can get this sorted out, and so we can prevent another edit war.
[Khosrow II]: GM, your credibility is already very low, as I have shown that you have a history of behaviour like this. Please do not try to turn this around. I have revealed your distortion on the talk page. The information I took out is due to repetitiveness, because what that quote is saying is already within the article. What Al Hamavi is saying is not what GM wants it to be, GM is distorting it. I am not one to take out sourced information unless I have a good reason that I can support. For example, I have still left the other quote in there, because as of now, I have no way to disprove it or a credible reason for taking it out. However, for this Hamavi quote, I do, and I have shown it. At best, we can add this source to the sentence in the article that says that sometimes many regions were combined into one large province, and add Hamavi's name to the list of figures that clearly distinguish between Azerbaijan and the region in the Caucasus.
[Khosrow II]: Also Sarah, can we speed things up regarding the situation between GM and I on the other two articles?
[Khosrow II]: Thanks for protecting the article for the moment. Sarah, we should start discussing the other two articles seriously, and you need to start making decisions now regarding what is already posted. We can go one for months with discussions, but that wont do any good, I suggest you give us a deadline (like a couple days) and then close the debate, and then you can make a decision regarding our comments. Sound good?
[Khosrow II]: Well, I was the one that suggested El_C moderate between us, but he was too busy. El_C probably wont be able to help out, because he was so busy he couldnt for over a week, so I guess GM will have to just settle with only you.
[Khosrow II]: Good, bring up information from verifiable reliable sources and I will have no problem. Thats what I've been doing all along, nice to see that you have now admitted that you are just now going to do that, as opposed to before.
[Khosrow II]: '''Sarah, its obvious that GM is not even reading my comments. I take the time to sit down, read his comments, and reply, and he cant even take the time to atleast read my comments. How are we going to get anywhere when he is being so disruptive?'''
[Khosrow II]: GM is being very disruptive on the [[History of the name Azerbaijan]] talk page. He purposely ignores what I write, does not respond to anything I say directly, and keeps diverting the discussion and making it go in circles. I dont know what else to do, both him and Ulvi are being very disruptive. Their actions include ignoring what I write, not answering my replies, not answering my questions, and bringing up the same issues over and over again, claiming I have not answered them when the writing is there for everyone to see (I have responded to their repetitive comments time and time again, yet what do I get from them? Nothing but ignoring, they dont even bother to read my posts, atleast thats what it seems like). I dont know what else to do, honestly. Any suggestions? I'm going to bed now, good night.
[Khosrow II]: I have repeatedly answered you, but you ignore what I write. This is evident in the discussion page Sarah created and its evident on the history of the name Azerbaijan article as well. Also, right after I proved Ulvi wrong using his very same source, he just left. And now, you refuse to respond to any of my posts, and you keep making the discussion go in circles. I have answered you plenty of times, and I'm not going to waste my time doing it again, you can re read the discussion page.
[Khosrow II]: The solution is quite simple. Move everyone who is not of the Azerbaijani nationality to their respective pages. Simple as that. Then we wont have such a misinformative and controversial article. There is already a debate going on in the List of Turks article as to why Atila the Hun and the President of the R. of Azerbaijan are in the list, along with others. The very same issue that I have been sayin is avoidable if all the List of .... articles are consistant.
[Khosrow II]: Sarah, I also had a similar ecounter with GM and Ulvi. Ulvi suddenly appeared where ever GM needed help, and then when GM disappeared for awhile so did Ulvi. Suspicious, no?
[Khosrow II]: It kept going in circles because you made it so. You never address the main issues, infact, you avoid them. For example, I have asked you for over a month to express your problems with a certain section, yet instead of doing so you start another revert war all over again."

A reviewer said it may be a bit too long, but other GA and FA anime-related articles are that long, so there's really no problem there. Lastly your formating is unclean; too listy, which doesn't look good in an article that is mostly prose (like this one).

[Kralizec!]: Thanks for the speedy reply.  My friendly request above was in reference to a couple of articles you edited that were also on my [[WP:WATCHLIST|watchlist]].  With the amount of vandalism we see these days, I ''always'' double-check edits made without using an edit summary.  As specified in [[WP:ES]], the usage of summaries is optional, but your fellow editors would really appreciate it if you used them more often.  Thank you for your time,
[Kralizec!]: When warning editors, you should also list the article they were editing.  To use the {{tl|uw-test1}} warning as an example, <nowiki>{{subst:uw-test1|Article}} --~~~~<\/nowiki> would warn the user regarding their edits to ''Article''.  --

Also, disambiguation pages should be assessed as ''NA'' for both class and importance, rather than ''Low'' ([http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Talk:HMS_Goliath&diff=next&oldid=158754176], [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Talk%3AHMS_Success&diff=159033144&oldid=108778053]).

[Kralizec!]: Thanks for restoring [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk%3A65.31.33.93&diff=198426162&oldid=198426142] the two messages on {{User|65.31.33.93}}`s talk page.  With all the message deletions, I went back and reviewed every edit to the page in order to make sure nothing was lost.  --
[Kralizec!]: You may have been a bit hasty deleting the no-source tag [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Image:%28S.A.W%29_grave.jpg&diff=prev&oldid=201967887] and having [[:Image:(S.A.W) grave.jpg]] copied to Commons [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Image:%28S.A.W%29_grave.jpg&diff=next&oldid=201967887].  Perhaps you have not reviewed the uploader's talk page, but {{user|Paki90}} has had over 80 of his photo contributions deleted.  Quite a few were blatant copyright violations (some even had watermarks identifying the legitimate copyright owners), the photos were taken with something like twenty-odd different cameras (ranging from professional SLRs to cheap consumer models to camera phones), ''Paki90'' could not answer questions about any of them, and all were incorrectly tagged {{tl|self}}, {{tl|GFDL-self-no-disclaimers}}, or something similar (including the photos he stole from the web sites of the [[Associated Press]], [[Boeing]], etc.).  Considering his track record for attempting to pass the works of others on as his own creations, I would be ''extremely'' wary of trusting his photo uploads without corroborating evidence.  --
[Kralizec!]: Thank you for the message you left on my talk page [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Kralizec%21&diff=next&oldid=212605499].  The first level {{tl|uw-vandalism1}} warning I issued to {{user|216.125.74.4}} was not a mistake as I prefer to AGF when it comes to massively shared IPs that have received zero warnings since last month.  However I am curious as to which part of [[WP:USER]] has been updated that makes it permissible to ''delete'' others' talk page messages and replace them with your own.  --
[Kralizec!]: I do not understand what you mean when you said that you were on RC patrol, as {{user|Delicious carbuncle}} was the one to revert the vandalism, and that was 16 minutes after the fact [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Sandwich&diff=212649160&oldid=212645925], so this instance of vandalism would have never shown up on the recent changes page when you were looking at it 57 minutes later.  The warning I left for this IP was in response to the AIV report made by ''Delicious carbuncle'' [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrator_intervention_against_vandalism&diff=212649357&oldid=212648894], which I declined to block due to the fact that the \""last warning\"" had been issued the previous month.  --
[Kralizec!]: Please do not mark articles as being {{tl|featured article}} when they are not (such as you did [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Dino_Meneghin&diff=prev&oldid=214680429 here] with [[Dino Meneghin]]).  --
[Kralizec!]: Generally I follow a 1RR when it comes to fellow admins, however I am not sure I can agree with your decision to indefinitely block {{user|McSaucePaste}}.  The editor had only received a single warning [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMcSaucePaste&diff=218723065&oldid=218722522], and it was only a {{tl|uw-vand3}}.  More importantly, this individual had not made ''any'' edits since receiving that warning (other than to blank his or her own user talk page).  --
[Kralizec!]: If that is the case, then please accept my apologies.  However next time I might recommend putting something in the block description about it being a vandal sock, as otherwise it looks like an out-of-process block to an un-involved admin.  --
[Kralizec!]: The two speedy deletion notices were just that, notices not warnings like {{tl|uw-create1}} thru {{tl|uw-create4im}}.  Regardless the editor never received a level-four warning for anything, and the last warning he or she received was a level-three.  Considering McSaucePaste apparently took heed of that warning and did not vandalize any more articles, but was blocked anyway ... yes, I call that an out-of-process block (because in essence, the account was blocked after a single level-one warning).  However the knowledge that the account in question is a vandal sock makes it ''not'' an out-of-process block ... which is the point I was trying to make: outside observers like me may not be aware of the history here and\/or sock issue that was the ultimate reason this account was blocked so rapidly.  Without that knowledge, otherwise uninvolved admins like me just see it as an out-of-process block.  --
[Kralizec!]: Perhaps you and I have a philosophical difference of opinion on this, but when I am processing AIV reports (like when McSaucePaste was reported today), I feel that the AIV instructions are very important, especially the part about vandals must have been given sufficient warnings.  When it comes to McSaucePaste, he received a {{tl|uw-vandalism1}} warning at 05:14, 11 June 2008 [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:McSaucePaste&diff=prev&oldid=218595334], ignored the warning to vandalize Limbo at 16:24, 11 June 2008 [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Limbo_%28dance%29&diff=218717278&oldid=218650137] (which was his only article edit since receiving the warning), then was indefinitely blocked 14 hours later.  Are you really advocating that vandals be blocked after just a single level-one warning?  --
[Kralizec!]: Ok, I think I have a better understanding on Wknight94's perspective.  Thank you for taking the time and patience to help me \""step out of the box\"" on this.  As to Baseball Bugs's comment, not sure I can agree with this ... I too am from the midwest (lived in Ohio for most of the past 34 years), and I almost ''never'' block someone unless they have received a final warning (with exceptions for socks and vandals currently running rampant with mass edits).  --

[Kralizec!]: Your statement [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk%3A66.102.80.212&diff=221317050&oldid=221227416] \""right to removal does not apply to IP addresses\"" is incorrect according to [[WP:USER]].  Please do not revert-war on this -or any other- user's talk page as it is a waste of everyone's time (not to mention being utterly futile).  --
[Kralizec!]: While I understand your frustration with the debate at [[Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (ships)]], that is no excuse for comparing those with whom you disagree to a third-world dictator.  Please comment on content rather than your fellow contributors.  --
[Kralizec!]: Hello.  The tmbox changes you made to {{tl|uw-block1}} look good ... with one exception.  Instead of being centered, the template should be left-justified to match the rest of the warnings\/messages\/block notices in the harmonized uw-scheme.  Thanks,
[Kralizec!]: Interesting.  I wonder how the centering will look with the numbered layout as specified at [[WP:UW]] and [[WP:UTM]].  --
[Kralizec!]: Also, I just noticed [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk%3A81.96.173.249&diff=240821394&oldid=240820872] that the admin .sig is no longer included inside the block template message box.  Is this an oversight or another \""feature\""?  --
[Kralizec!]: I guess I would use the phrase \""looks terrible\"" but \""awkward\"" works just as well.  While I would really like to support the {{tl|tmbox}}, forcing newer (working) templates like the uw-series into the change without first addressing all the issues gives me great pause.  It would be a different story if someone had said back in January 2007 \""hey, make sure these new uw templates follow [[Template:Tmbox\/styles]]\"" but 627 days later?  --

[Kralizec!]: Thank you for the explanation on my talk page [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKralizec%21&diff=243803058&oldid=243538233].  No need to apologize; just be more careful in the future when using a shared computer!  --
[Kralizec!]: Just wanted to let you know that I reverted your change [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Template:Schoolblock&diff=next&oldid=238824869] to {{tl|schoolblock}}.  Since this template is not transcluded, all 5835 instances of its use had their signature component broken by this change.  While I appreciate the boldness of your change, next time you might wish to discuss your proposed changes first at [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject user warnings]].  --
[Kralizec!]: Perhaps if it were part of the uw-series of template messages it would be substituted.  That, and the instructions on the template itself say \""do not subst this template as contact details may change in the future.\""  --
[Kralizec!]: Yeah, that has pretty much been my disposition about it too.  While it is annoying to have to remember to follow two different formats (one for the uw-series and a different one for schoolblock\/anonblock), I have never been annoyed ''enough'' to actually fix it.  --
[Kralizec!]: Hello.  One of your edits to the [[Neustrashimy class frigate]] article has me puzzled.  Unless it was an accident, I cannot for the life of me figure out why you removed half of the external links as well as the article's only template, all of its cats, and the interwiki links [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Neustrashimy_class_frigate&diff=prev&oldid=241574524].  Thanks,
[Kralizec!]: Not sure I follow you about {{user|83.105.121.220}}, as the only edit made by this IP in the past six hours is valid [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Police_vehicles_in_the_United_Kingdom&diff=next&oldid=253457456].  --
[Kralizec!]: Are you confusing the college's network administrator, Chris Davies, for the person who is on the other side of these IPs?  --

[Kralizec!]: Hello.  While perusing AfD, I ran across your listing for [[Chicago Film Producers Alliance]].  However my take on the beginning part [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion\/Chicago_Film_Producers_Alliance&diff=next&oldid=261323904] is a little different.  {{user|ATurnerIII}} did not complain loudly; he instead asked nicely [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKralizec%21%2FArchive_2008&diff=260626986&oldid=260582528] to the first random member of {{cl|Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles}} he found - which happened to be me.  As per his request, I userfied it and left him instructions [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk%3AATurnerIII&diff=260778337&oldid=260713808] to \""improve the article so that it meets our [[WP:ORG|organizational notability standards]],\"" and then \""[[WP:MOVE|move]] it back into [[Wikipedia:Main namespace|article space]].\""  Had I known that he ignored my instructions and re-created essentially the exact same article the next day, I would have deleted it myself.  I am not sure what I should have done differently, but I am sorry that you have had to deal with this entire mess, and especially the editor's belligerent attitude.  I feel responsible, and would like to apologize to you.  --
[Kralizec!]: Hello.  Could you help me understand your reverts of the talk page contributions of {{user|81.132.107.66}}, especially as regarding to [[Talk:Drake Circus Shopping Centre]]?  Thank you,
[Kralizec!]: Thanks for taking care of the block notice for me!  That was #2 on my list after \""clean up mess.\""  --
[Kralizec!]: Also, you might want to double-check that I moved everything back to the right spots.  As my wife always points out, I am a notoriously bad speller, so I may not have been the best admin to fix all her moves.  --
[Kralizec!]: Thanks for the revert!  --
[Kralizec!]: Just curious, but why did you tag [[ARA Independencia]] as being an orphan?  It is a disambiguation page, rather than an article.  Thanks, \u2014
[Kralizec!]: Not being familiar with the subject of conversion disorder, it could take me some time to sift through everything and figure out if there is a pattern.  However if you -as a subject matter expert- could provide me with [[WP:DIFF|diffs]] showing how two different editors have made substantively the same edits, I could react ''much'' faster in protecting the project from disruption.  Thanks, \u2014
[Kralizec!]: Since the block on the original IP has expired, the current account is not engaging in block evasion.  Likewise none of the previous users were [[WP:BAN|banned]], so it is not ban evasion either.  As such, I cannot in good faith block the user.  I would suggest engaging the user to build a consensus version of the article, and if that does not work, use the standard [[WP:UTM|warning track]].  \u2014
[Kralizec!]: Unfortunately on the internet, anyone can pretend to be anything they want.  Wikipedia's only defense against that is our three core content policies: [[WP:NOR]], [[WP:VER]], and [[WP:NPOV]].  Rather than allow the editor to express his or her own -and potentially off the wall- opinions (a violation of [[WP:NOR]] and [[WP:NPOV]]), they must support any material that has been challenged (or likely to be challenged) with [[WP:CITE|citations]] to [[WP:RS|reliable, third-party, published]] sources (as per [[WP:VER]]).  \u2014
[Kralizec!]: The plot thickens.  The results of my preliminary investigation may be found at {{cl|Suspected Wikipedia sockpuppets of GayleNuffer}}.  Did I mention that I am in training as a SPI cleric ... ?   :-)  \u2014
[Kralizec!]: I doubt that a rangeblock would work in this case.  Leaving aside the massive potential for collateral damage, Gayle has asserted her opinions on this topic from two different ISPs as well as an AFB.  Should she press her juvenile threat, I suspect that [[WP:RBI]] paired like a fine wine with [[WP:DENY]] would be our best option.  In the meantime, I am going to go ahead and add the articles in question to my watchlist.  If you do the same, that should afford us some measure of protection.  \u2014
[Kralizec!]: He is right about [[Colonial Bancgroup]] being replaced by [[City National Bank (California)]] on the source.  I was very surprised to see that the FFIEC did a mid-quarter update of the list without changing the \""as of\"" date.  \u2014
[Kralizec!]: Hope this helps clear up any confusion that people may have experienced over this issue.  Assuming ''MBK004'' does not mind us using his talk page, you can feel free to respond here if you have any additional questions or concerns regarding this topic.  Thanks, \u2014
[Kralizec!]: With wikis, few things stay the same for long.  :-)  So ... if someone told you differently at some point in the past, the other person might well have been correct.  However it has only been within the past sixteen months that [[WP:BLANKING]] was explicitly updated to include anonymous editors.  Prior to that was anyone's guess.  And yes, lots of people have unknowingly flubbed this up over the years and inadvertently harassed IPs over their talk page warnings (me being one of the worst).  As penance for those earlier harassment sins, I now travel about and try to help people avoid making the same mistakes I did.  \u2014
[Kralizec!]: Hello.  As a recent editor to [[User talk:117.104.180.91]], I wanted to leave a friendly reminder that as per [[WP:USER]], editors may remove messages at will from their own talk pages.  While we may ''prefer'' that comments be archived instead, policy does not prohibit users -including anonymous editors like this one- from deleting messages or warnings from their own talk pages.  The only kinds of talk page messages that cannot be removed (as per [[WP:BLANKING]]) are declined unblock requests (but only while blocks are still in effect), confirmed sockpuppet notices, or shared IP header templates (for unregistered editors).  However, it should be noted that these exceptions only exist in order to keep a user from potentially gaming the system.  Thanks, \u2014
[Kralizec!]: Daleks are the supreme power, of the universe!

[Kralizec!]: Hello.  I was going to leave you a friendly reminder about [[WP:BLANKING]] in regards to your improper revert at [[User talk:24.79.238.203]], but I see that ''Xeno'' already did that a couple of months ago.  Would you care to explain what happened here?  Thanks,  \u2014
[Kralizec!]: No worries; I am glad to hear it was just a mixup with the tools.  As to your question, WP:BLANKING indicates that ''declined'' unblock requests should not be removed (and that is only to prevent abuse of the unblock system).  Thanks again, \u2014
[Kralizec!]: Sorry to hear about the results of the ArbCom election.  While I was terrified that MILHIST and SHIPS would be all the poorer if you were elected to ArbCom, I still voted for you anyway.  Better luck next time, mate!  :-)   \u2014
[Kralizec!]: It looks like {{user|98.89.138.15}} may be the sequal to the original fun [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:MBK004&oldid=309854260#Moon_.22men.22].  \u2014
[Kralizec!]: Looking into it now ...  \u2014
[Kralizec!]: Thanks for catching [[Jack Swigert]] and [[Ken Mattingly]].  I was focusing on [[List of Apollo astronauts#Apollo astronauts who walked on the Moon|walked on the Moon]] rather than [[List of Apollo astronauts#Apollo astronauts who flew to the Moon without landing|flew to the Moon]].  Hopefully this will give Gayle a chance to [[Conservapedia|find something better to do]] with his or her time.  \u2014
[Kralizec!]: Yeah, I caught that spelling correction too, but want to check a couple of more things before I expressing anything more than a 'strong suspicion' on the issue.  \u2014

Should I just block your account now, or is this all the reminder you need to stop reverting and start using the talk page to discuss disagreements?  \u2014
[Kralizec!]: After examining several of the reverts you have made this week to Islam-related articles, I find that you are in violation of the editing restrictions you previously agreed to.  Since you have resumed the same [[WP:DE|disruptive]], [[WP:NPOV|POV-pushing]] behavior that got you blocked before, I am restoring the block.  As multiple administrators and innumerable editors have told you, Wikipedia is not the appropriate place to push your agenda. \u2014

194.46.189.195,False,"[194.46.189.195]: Apologies if this is in the wrong place, but I noted the absence of a reference to the ancestry of four of the lead singers of CW as having been part of Anuna. I left a comment for you at the edit but must have done it wrong. Please accept an apology for my ignorance. The comment was \""Hi. I wouldn't call the info I inserted random trivia. The fact that four of the solo singers came from the ranks of Anuna is acknowledged in all of their official biographies and surely has a direct impact on their style of singing. It is surprising that this fact isn't already on the site\"". You undid the reference and listed it as random trivia. I think that it isn't, and that wouldn't simply be a matter of personal taste. Meav was part of Anuna for at least four years, Deirdre for at least three years, and Lynn for around four or five. I think Orla was part of that group for around a year. All four women list it on their CVs. Three of those women appear dotted as soloists all over the Anuna albums I have, and it is logical (and I suppose) correct, to assume that they were highly influenced by this group in their vocal approach to the music of Celtic Woman. It was, after all, Anuna that pioneered the \""high soprano\"" sound in the early 1990s through their work with Riverdance, and subsequently produced the soprano vocals of Eimear Quinn, winner of Eurovision Song Contest 1996. You might also note that most of the choral singers in the background are ex-Anuna I believe. I would point out that while you may think this is random trivia, Anuna appear to be still producing something unique enough for Celtic Woman to believe otherwise.

Shamir1,False,"[Shamir1]: TOM, you have got to be kidding me! Isabella of Castile played a very strong role setting up the Spanish Inquisition. She ordered Jews to be executed or expelled. Martin Luther was fiercely anti-Semitic. Please see [[Martin Luther and the Jews]] and [[On the Jews and Their Lies]].
[Shamir1]: Hi Tom, none of this is \""original research\"" it is ALL on WIKIPEDIA. it is not my opinion, these are all facts that are on this site. please look at each of the articles I showed you, including [[Isabella of Castile]]'s. thanks.
[Shamir1]: I was already briefing it up and tried to preview the page but I lost the server, then reloaded, then saw your comment and here we are. So now again, I'm on it. Thanks. --
[Shamir1]: What I got duped into believing? Then it might b a good idea to tell the producers ''[[60 Minutes]]'' who included it in an episode. Was this the first time you heard of it? I remember mainstream news here showing that clip on television, and a while ago a girlfriend of mine from France recalled the incident, so it was reported in Europe as well. And by the way, I am still thinking and editing back and forth on the Biden section. --
[Shamir1]: Also, the CNN source you added does not confirm the claim, and it is also before any actual investigation. If you actually look at each report, the Biden part (which is the only statement from a United States representative and only one that counters the UN team) is hardly longer than the rest. --
[Shamir1]: I added the thing to the camp because it is unsupported. I even had it translated to English and did not find those words anywhere. That is why we need a better citation, not because I \""think every Palestinian source is crap.\"" You gave the official camp site, yes, but where are those words? --
[Shamir1]: The main problem with the CNN source was not the \""initial\"" part, it was the fact that it does not even mention a massacre. \""Don't you get that?\"" Secondly, if you have a problem with the CNN report, tell it to them. Three, Americans got a kick out of it becuase they were NOT dying, just pretending they were. I have no idea where you got the idea that they were getting a kick out of them dying. Who was dying there? (And again, it was shown in Europe too.) I had to shorten the statement because it was too heavy without any source. I was not assuming bad faith, and thank you for providing me with those. I will have them translated. --
[Shamir1]: The CNN story reports the Palestinian claim which we already know is false. That's it. Nothing about fear or a massacre. I don't know why so many of the comments you say to may sound so appropriate when it comes to you, but hey, you've been here long enough to know that. --
[Shamir1]: Nor do I appreciate you mischaracterizing mine... Where did I say I reverted that edit because of vandalism? --
[Shamir1]: Please comment before making such a move. There is no problem with the source. No user has argued that Freedom House, which is used on several other Wikipedia pages, is not reputable source. Please read this carefully. I have taken the rules of Wikipedia into consideration. \""The need for citations is especially important when writing about opinions held on a particular issue. Avoid weasel words where possible, such as, \""Some people say ...\"" Instead, make your writing verifiable: find a specific person or group who holds that opinion and give a citation to a reputable publication in which they express that opinion. Remember that Wikipedia is not a place for expressing your own opinions or for original research.\"" The sentence (that was just reverted) followed all of such rules exactly. --
[Shamir1]: Why? Easy. Two big reasons: 1) The source is reputable and reliable. 2) I am following the [[WP:REF|rules]]. All the trouble just described is the result of users trying to wander around the very basic rules of Wikipedia. --
[Shamir1]: Israel is widely called such. This is one of the most prominent research institutes on democracy and freedom in the world. It is sufficient and an acceptable source for the intro. Having Freedom House say it is already a wide enough view. For months and months that sentence was there with the citation but without it saying that it is according to Freedom House. So now its come under attack, and I have added to say that it is the view of Freedom House (in addition to the citation already there). But even what I just said doesnt matter all that much. What matters is that we follow [[WP:REF]]. --
[Shamir1]: And I, and all Wikipedians, certainly CAN quote opinion pieces--and cite them as such.  The discussion of Hadash's politics is not found in the article. It would be a good idea to add it, which is why I felt it important to find a source. Really. One sentence from a piece that pretty much sums up the criticism against Hadash's alleged \""drift\"" is relevant and necessary. It should be correctly cited, and it is. --
[Shamir1]: Thanks for your edits to [[New Movement-Meretz]]. I have edited several Israeli political party articles and am familiar with all of them. I am wondering why you added so many references to the fact that Meretz is a left-wing party. Meretz indeed is a left-wing party, and it proudly identifies as such. That is not disputed, so I am not sure why it is needed, but there may be something I am unaware of. Thanks. --"

[Maimai009]: Hi. I know such a consensus exists, though I don't agree with it. In my opinion, a high school can't be ''notable'' only by the fact that it ''exists'', it is not sufficient.

[Martinevans123]: Hi Peter, please forgive the intrusion. I have been browsing your many excellent edits to so many churches. Bravo. I wonder have you ever had a look at [[Westminster Abbey]]? Obviuously it has received a lot of attention, but it seems that it does not have and never has had any bells. Is this correct?
[Martinevans123]: Absolutely, many thanks. But did you think that the bells might be worthy of mention in the [[Westminster Abbey]] article? Also, while you're here! - you might want to take a look at the church of St.Thomas at [[Redwick, Newport]] which currently has \""...rhe fourth and fifth are pre-reformation bells from the Bristol foundry, dated circa 1350-1380 making them some of the oldest church bells working anywhere in the country.\"" I wonder, does this claim stand up to expert scrutiny? Many thanks for your kind help.
[Martinevans123]: Many thanks. It might be useful if I added the Dove site as a citation for the age of the Redwick bells, if not for their comparative age.
[Martinevans123]: Please excuse the intrusion, Graham, but you seemed to be an experienced editor with a leaning towards Eng Lit. I am struggling to find a free image of Davies for the article and wondered if it was acceptable to use a book cover? Any advice gratefully received. Thank you for your time.
[Martinevans123]: Or are you aware of any similar uses? Many thanks.
[Martinevans123]: Thank you Graham and sorry to disturb your reading frenzy! Your reply confirms what I suspected alas, but is also very helpful. Searching Google images I now see that the National Portait Gallery has seven images of Davies [http:\/\/images.google.co.uk\/imgres?imgurl=http:\/\/www.theotherpages.org\/poems\/faces\/davies_wh_01.jpg&imgrefurl=http:\/\/www.theotherpages.org\/poems\/faces.html&usg=__u2WjGdQbwrtvrKHiR_b6w02ogr4=&h=388&w=250&sz=24&hl=en&start=2&um=1&tbnid=OyilrC37uAgKdM:&tbnh=123&tbnw=79&prev=\/images%3Fq%3D%2522w.%2Bh.%2Bdavies%2522%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DG%26um%3D1] and it may be possible for me to request a licence to use one of these in the article. I'll give it a try anyway and I'll let you know what happens. Thanks again.
[Martinevans123]: Hi again Graham. The short answer is that the image I am interested in is \""Unknown Copyright\"". But NPG are currently in dispute with Wiki over unauthorised images and so won't release copies of anything, even for a indemnity fee. I can email you further details if you are interested.
[Martinevans123]: Hello Pavel. The description \""Hermann Rorschach, psychiatrist died in 1922, so this image is public domain.\"" has now been added to the licensing field by [[User talk:Chillum|<font color=\""Green\"">'''Chillum'''<\/font>]]. Tthere has been a small amount of discussion about the origin of the image here: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Talk:Rorschach_test#Image_of_Hermann_Rorschach]. I wonder do you know the source of this image, the identity of the photographer or publisher and the country where it originated? Many thanks for any help you can give.
[Martinevans123]: I wonder do you have any more details of the Harrison reference you have left in those Further Reading sections? Many thanks.
[Martinevans123]: Many thanks for the info. I am still trying to ascertain details of Frost's marital history - see [[Talk:John Frost (Chartist)]]. Any information or ideas much appreciated. Regards.
[Martinevans123]: Thanks for the note. I'm not sure what I've added to [[Joseph Priestley]] that might be considered contentious. I'm glad to see that the quote on [[Priestley Riots]] now looks like a quote and not just another paragraph.
[Martinevans123]: Hi Jolly. I see that you're on about version 37 by now? I wondered if you were planning to address all or any of the points on the image talk page? Or to add a brief response at all? Many thanks.

[Martinevans123]: Yes sure. Both sublime indeed. But at least yours is colourful! It often feels like we are indeed \""at the Mill with slaves\"" doesn't it?!
[Martinevans123]: I see that you have very quickly and quietly dumped the additions regarding the BBC2 ''History Cold Case'' archaeology at Windy Pits. I'd agree that the story may not be directly relevant to the town itself, but I was wondering if you could suggest where else it might fit? Windy Pits really appears only [[List of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in North Yorkshire|here]] as far as I can see. Many thanks.
[Martinevans123]: But now it's back again??
[Martinevans123]: Fine. Apologies for missing that. But it was only put in this article by default. Do you think it would be better in the [[Duncombe Park]] article?
[Martinevans123]: \""I really don't know why I edit. It's not even about the hall.\"" - Talk Page awaiting your input. Thanks.
[Martinevans123]: Shame, I was expecting a proper discussion. But glad you're not being stuffy.
[Martinevans123]: That thanks heartily endorsed.
[Martinevans123]: Hi there Gh. I was just wondering if you had any view on [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Stow_Hill,_Newport&diff=next&oldid=439314708 this recent edit]? Thanks.
[Martinevans123]: Well, don't worry, they have taken a little advice and it all looks much better now. (New Mexico!?)

[HenryXVII]: I have replied to your opinions at that [[Talk:Eleanor, Fair Maid of Brittany|Talk Page]] and raised a new question. Waiting for your reply. Sincerely.
[HenryXVII]: I see you have removed the titular succession box of English kings on the page of [[Arthur I of Brittany]]. But it is under no doubt that Arthur had a better claim to English throne, although at that time there was not a complete succession law (thus Angevin law preferred Arthur and Norman law preferred John), and Arthur himself openly attempted to get the throne, that meant he was surely a claimant\/pretender. I suppose you do not acknowledge Arthur was the rightful successor? However, I have also noticed that you have also read and edited the article of [[Eleanor, Fair Maid of Brittany|Eleanor]] sister of Arthur. Yes, if I lived at that time, I would support the siblings to be monarchs rather than John and Henry III, and it was me who added the titular boxes to tell the readers they were the rightful heirs to England, albeit they never ascended the throne. In fact, neither of the siblings gave up his\/her claim to the throne as far as I am concerned. But.... the box of Arthur has been removed, but that of Eleanor still exists.... Arthur had been the heir presumptive, and Eleanor was his heir presumptive.... If they were claimants\/pretenders, both boxes should remain; if not, both should be removed; and should the titular succession box of Breton dukes on the article of Eleanor (also added by me) remain or not? Thanks.
[HenryXVII]: It might be difficult for the captive princess to claim her rights actively.... In 1214 she accompanied John during his campaign to France to scheme against Alix of Brittany, but I could not tell whether she was willing to do so. Whatever, I think I can be sure that she had been styled Countess of Richmond, at least. I found quite some sources referring to her as \""Countess of Richmond\"" or simply \""c. Richmond\"". If there was any doubt \u2014 did she use this title till 1219 when it was granted to Pierre or some time before the year?"

[Corvus cornix]: [[User:Sandstein]] is an admin, and as such, he has been recognized by the Wikipedia community as one of those who can be trusted with the responsibility of keeping the site clean of copyright violations, among other things.  I see nothing anywhere close to an attack in his comments.
[Corvus cornix]: You have to realize that Wikipedia admins are always getting challenged when they're trying to do their jobs.  If you don't put a valid copyright tag on an image, and you've been repeatedly asked to do so, it's looked upon as disruptive.  I will admit that Sandstein's language may have been a little harsh, especially the upper casing, but he's probably having a bad day.  :)  Try asking him on his Talk page what it is that he's asking for.  :)

[Corvus cornix]: Please see [[WP:ATT]] and [[WP:BLP]].  All claims about living people must be sourced to reliable sources.  Almost every source in the Hocevar article is a debian source.  Aren't there any newspapers or technical journals which have talked about him?

[Corvus cornix]: The entire second paragraph is sourced from Sam Hocevar's personal blog, which is not a reliable source, except for a link to a slashdot page which makes absolutely no mention of him.
[Corvus cornix]: They could always argue on their Talk page, but if the article winds up being deleted, can they be blocked?

{unknown-7518},False,"[{unknown-7518}]: I'm not especially convinced that many editors, either on the keep, delete, or redirect side ''actually read'' over those proposed articles, since very few commented on them directly.  So whether they were convinced by them or not seems like a moot point of debate, because few discussion points focused on the proposed articles.  One debate on [http:\/\/thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com\/2011\/07\/18\/the-education-of-marcus-bachmann\/ this source], with what I consider to be a fair justification from Silverseren: ''\""We have a significant amount of information about him outside of his wife's campaign. The fact that the campaign instigated this information being published is irrelevant, all that matters is the information itself and the fact that he is covered in detail by highly reliable sources.\""''  I mostly read non-keep arguments as overextensions of [[WP:NOTINHERITED]] and [[WP:BLP1E]], rather than being unconvinced by the proposed articles."

Earlier today, I [[Talk:Libya lobby_in_the_United_States#Assistance_requested|posted a request for an independent editor]] to review the article in light of facts and research I have introduced. I do not wish to edit the page directly, because I am commenting on behalf of Monitor Group, and the subject matter I have inquired about is sensitive. If you have the time and are willing, please review and take any action on the page you see fit. Thank you,
[Cambridge141]: Alternatively, my concerns have been already been addressed by independent editors on the Monitor Group [[Talk:Monitor_Group#Assistance_requested|talk page]]--resulting in a significantly improved article. Because no one seems interested in this page, I wonder if it would stir any controversy if I was to re-make similar improvements myself? I am very cautious about making edits, considering the circumstances. Please let me know what you think. Thanks,

I would like to start off by saying that I understand why you did that. One reason why I did not remove the list myself is because I was hoping to create (or that someone else would create) a shortened list or a brief paragraph or two of sisters for the main \""Kappa Alpha Theta\"" article. The main reason why I hesitated on shortening the list myself is because I am not a member of Kappa Alpha Theta and did not want to offend anyone by removing only some members. Is there a way for me to note that (on this article and\/or future ones) and to suggest that someone does that and\/or ask I should go about it myself? Sorry for bothering you about this, but it seems that you are pretty experienced w\/ wiki-editing so I figured you might have some suggestions. Thank you! --"
Fisherjs,False,"[Fisherjs]: I wasn't using a bot, but my brain was obviously on bot mode not to notice that the article had somehow been truncated to [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Gary_Lucas&oldid=63160331 this]. Sorry about that; I don't know how that happened.--
[Fisherjs]: Hey, it's not a huge thing, but I just edited a few album pages where you were the only user in the history log. You may want to see how I edited \""your\"" pages (check my contributions or see the articles that you modified in the last day or two). Specifically, according to [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Albums]], track names should be in quotes, and track numbers should use the # symbol. Otherwise, keep plugging away at all that Latin music.  Keep up the good work.--
[Fisherjs]: Thanks, but you might want to let [[User:James Janderson]] know about that since he is the person that added the image to the performer's page.  I uploaded it, but only added it to the [[Agua de Cuba|album article]].--
[Fisherjs]: Also, that page has a handy guide to the album infobox and a discussion of what categories should (and should not) go on an album page.--
[Fisherjs]: You're welcome.  And if I wasn't feeling so lazy at the time, I would have standardized a few other things such as putting track names in quotes, offsetting the times with an ndash, and removing the <nowiki><small><\/nowiki> tag from the times.  How about if I leave that to you?  As I put in my edit summary, you can visit [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Albums]] for more on the project to help with your template before you create lots of new pages.--
[Fisherjs]: I wouldn't worry about moving it (it's not an uncommon error and besides there are bigger \""problems\"" out there to fix).  If you want other opinions, post something to the [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Albums|WikiProject Albums]] talk page.--
[Fisherjs]: Actually, my edit was to make the \""a\"" in \""album\"" lowercase so that the link worked, but in the process I removed that space as well.  I could have been more clear with the edit summary (usually I put \""red link fix\"" but didn't for that edit for some reason).--
[Fisherjs]: I think you are misunderstanding what a wiki is about.  As [[User:Nufy8]] said, you don't \""own\"" the pages you create and you should adhere to the standards of a project.  Also, you have a funny habit of signing articles and not talk pages.  It should be the other way around.--
[Fisherjs]: As you can see, I [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Redemption_%28album%29&diff=84680741&oldid=84616727 added a category], because it didn't have one yet.  I think you misunderstood my edit and may have confused it with the notability template that [[User:Y control]] added.--
[Fisherjs]: I'm going pretty much A-Z, but when I find an artist that has many albums w\/o boxes, then I often take care of all of them at once (see [[Luciano]]).  Do whatever makes you happy, though.--

[Fisherjs]: I had the syntax of the infobox wrong.  It's [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Worms_Eat_My_Garbage&diff=105088549&oldid=99090612 fixed] now.--
[Fisherjs]: That's the right template.  One template for all types so that the article ends up in [[:Category:WikiProject Albums articles]].--
[Fisherjs]: If I understand your question, then I think the answer is simply to click the \""edit this page\"" tab on top of the article (or simply [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Fabric_34&action=edit here]).  Or you can click the [edit] link for section 1 and then just change the 1 to a 0 in the URL (that's the fancy and slick way to edit section \""0\"").  Hope that answers your question.  Be sure to check out [[WP:ALBUM]] if you are interested in album articles in general.  Cheers!  --
[Fisherjs]: I just ran across [[Environmental Transformation of North America Prior to European Colonization|this article]] (because I chip in [[Wikipedia:WikiProject_Categories\/uncategorized|categorizing articles]]) and it just read strange.  After a look through the history, it seems that the content was added by just one user: [[User:Aaronl13]] and a look through the user's contribs shows that they joined WP pretty much just to post that article.  The only other mainspace edit they had was to link the article at [[Deforestation]], which has since been removed, but I don't know why or when (that history is simply too long to go through).  So, does this article need a NPOV tag or PROD or something else entirely, or is it fine and just underdeveloped?  I don't know enough to judge its accuracy or even [[Truthiness]].  Thanks!  --

[Fisherjs]: Once or twice I saw this message.  Couldn't figure out under what conditions it was acting.  Besides, my internet connection has been acting up so I thought it was just related to that.--

[Fisherjs]: It's cool.  Good to see someone else around that page. --
[Fisherjs]: No trouble.  Just doing my job. --
[Fisherjs]: Sorry that I didn't open it up for any discussion; I am just working my way through [[User:Jogers\/List5|this list]].  But still, we don't follow the capitalization on the album cover itself (so many albums would be in all caps).  For example, see [[The Return of the Space Cowboy]] where the capitalization of \""of\"" and \""the\"" differ from the album cover (evidently \""cowboy\"" too).  If you want to raise the issue at [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Albums]] to see what others think, be my guest.  Thanks for the note.  --
[Fisherjs]: I've been avoiding the issue because I don't know what rules, if any, to apply to these titles.  Maybe best to ask at [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Albums]]?--
[Fisherjs]: If you like [[:Category:Album articles needing infoboxes]] you'll love [[:User:Jogers\/Album articles without infobox]].  Just wanted to alert you to that list in case you didn't know of it.  Thanks for your work on this stuff.--
[Fisherjs]: No harm, no foul.  It's quite optional to update that page manually.  Jogersbot will take care of it in time.--

[2over0]: If you find yourself in an editing dispute, use the article's [[Wikipedia:Talk page guidelines|talk page]] to discuss controversial changes. Work towards wording, and content that represents [[Wikipedia:Consensus|consensus]] among editors. You can post a request for help at an [[Wikipedia:Noticeboards|appropriate noticeboard]] or seek [[Wikipedia:Dispute resolution|dispute resolution]]. In some cases it may be appropriate to request temporary [[Wikipedia:Protection policy|page protection]]. If edit warring continues, '''you may be [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocked]] from editing without further notice.''' <!-- Template:uw-3rr --> -
[2over0]: It looks like we can [[RSS]] them, though, using the button under ''Toolbox'' at the relevant Special:Contributions\/ page. -
[2over0]: The whole [[Integrative medicine]] article was [[WP:PARAPHRASE|closely paraphrased]] from the linked source. Check under each section header to see how the wording and sources line up. It has been edited a fair bit in the last week, though, so it may be that it no longer qualifies as CSD as the original version did. Thanks for looking. -
[2over0]: I can respect that; that is why we get two sets of eyes on these, at least one of which is uninvolved. -
[2over0]: I proposed the merger before I found the source page while trying to find citations for some of the unsourced bits. A bunch of it is out of date so far as [[WP:MEDRS]] is concerned, but enough people are watching that the content can probably be brought to heel wherever it ends up. -
[2over0]: I have closed [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard\/Edit warring#User:89.241.217.215 and User:89.241.218.10 reported by User:WildCherry06 (Result: malformed)]] without action, as it does not seem to be an [[WP:edit warring|edit warring]] issue. Is there some controversy regarding those times? If not, the edits you reported may be simple vandalism, and I could issue a range block for that set of IP addresses accordingly. Reply here is fine, or ping me if I do not notice soon. -
[2over0]: They disagreed with apparently reliable cited sources and did not provide any of their own. It seemed an odd choice for a vandalism target, so thank you for the sanity check. I think I have put them all back, but please fix any I have missed. -
[2over0]: Drat, that would block a larger block of IP addresses than I think this warrants. I just [[WP:PPOL|semi-protected]] a swath of pages. Can you keep an eye out in case they start a discussion? Alternatively, there might be a second smaller range block possible. Good luck, -

[2over0]: I just closed [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard\/Edit warring#User:John Foxe reported by User:FyzixFighter (Result: moot)]] (it looks like the bot tried but failed to notify you). Please be more careful - further edit warring is likely to see you blocked. As a recommendation (not a requirement, just a recommendation), you might consider taking a week off from editing this article, concentrating instead on reaching [[WP:con|consensus]] at the several talkpage threads. -
[2over0]: Oh dear me oh my oh no, I seem to have had a reading comprehension fail - rereading your initial question to AN, I pretty clearly misinterpreted your request. Thank you so much for having a sense of humor about it. Now then, now that that is sorted out like it never happened - would you like everything that starts with User:Ohms Law Bot\/Cleanup\/ deleted? I suppose that would be due penance for snafuing the other. -
[2over0]: Cool. In that case, I will treat it as my 'stop screwing around and learn the API' project'. -
[2over0]: An editor has asked for a discussion to address the redirect [[APA (shrinks)]]. Since you had some involvement with the ''APA (shrinks)'' redirect, you might want to participate in [[Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion\/Log\/2011 June 16#APA (shrinks)|the redirect discussion]] (if you have not already done so). <!-- from Template:RFDNote --> -
[2over0]: I am not sure why Twinkle phrases the message that way, but I just nominated a redirect you created for deletion. Discussion at that link. -
[2over0]: You have been engaged in an [[WP:EW|edit war]] at [[Quantitative easing]]. Given the currently heated atmosphere surrounding that article, I would like to request that you take a voluntary unilateral no-fault one month break from editing that article (but not the talkpage). There are enough editors paying attention there that any edits you propose that attain [[WP:con|consensus]] will be swiftly enacted by another editor. This is a request for voluntary action, but please be aware that any further edit warring may result in you being [[WP:BLOCK|blocked from editing]]. Please also be more circumspect in your communications with other editors; [[WP:NOTBATTLEGROUND|Wikipedia is not a battleground]]. When an editorial disagreement starts to get out of hand, it is best to restrict your comments carefully to potential improvements of the article while following the steps outlined at [[WP:Dispute resolution]].

[Cookatoo.ergo.ZooM]: Re your question:  I have not got the foggiest myself.  I just filled in the form - it contains an entry box at the bottom, something like \""Where to put the paper?\"" - so I wrote \""put it in front of the door to the apartment\"",  but I am not certain how they come through the front door of the building without ringing our bell at some ungodly hour in the moring.

Jimmuldrow,False,"[Jimmuldrow]: Thanks! It's always nice to know what works, and what doesn't.
[Jimmuldrow]: Ok. Thanks for the info.
[Jimmuldrow]: If Palin has real responsibilities, why isn't she responsible for hiring and firing decisions? Or for knowing the results of hiring and firing decisions? Or for knowing what budget items were cut (including a miscellaneous fund as Mayor of Wasilla)?
[Jimmuldrow]: After a 3RR violation, please come up with a better explanation of why Pain is not responsible for her hiring, firing and budget decisions than \""huh?\"" or stop reverting.
[Jimmuldrow]: Just wondering.
[Jimmuldrow]: You never use the discussion page for discussion. You just keep repeating the same stuff about a non-existent Fannon page. You talk about discussion just for show.
[Jimmuldrow]: My edits were a good faith attempt to show both sides of the issue, or at least that was my intention.
[Jimmuldrow]: A better source was added.
[Jimmuldrow]: The \""OR\"" was done not by me but by Sarah Palin, who credited Bachmann for her opinion on Ezekiel Emanuel. Bachmann and Palin both quoted from Betsy McCaughey's article ''Deadly Doctors''. ABC News, TIME and The Atlantic mentioned all this.
[Jimmuldrow]: Please explain what TIME, ABC News and the Atlantic are missing when they indicate otherwise.
[Jimmuldrow]: Or when Palin said on September 8, directly referring to Ezekiel Emanuel, ''particularly disturbing'' and ''Such ideas are shocking''?
[Jimmuldrow]: Thanks. I tried to fix the error you mentioned. You were right about that.
[Jimmuldrow]: It was Palin herself who was \""synthesizing\"" the \""propter hoc\"", as described by both the references and Palin's posts to her facebook page. Read the references ''accurately''. The \""propter hoc\"" comment would make sense only if you don't read the references at all. As explained by the media and Palin herself, Palin said that the Bachmann speech was the source of her ideas about Ezekiel Emanuel.
[Jimmuldrow]: It would seem that you see your own version of references, in order to make the \""post hoc\"" \""propter hoc\"" statement possible. For example, if the ABC statement were altered (in the mind's of some editors, perhaps) to read as follows: ''Palin refers in her statement to Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., who in a speech on the floor of the House, Palin said, described the \""Orwellian thinking of the president\u2019s health care advisor, Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, the brother of the White House chief of staff. ... I commend her for being a voice for the most precious members of our society, our children and our seniors.\""'' In other words, mentally edit out facts that contradict. Since Palin referred directly to Bachmann's speech about Ezekiel Emanuel, you can't describe them as seperate random unrelated events.
[Jimmuldrow]: Sounds about right to me. I tried.
[Jimmuldrow]: Ok, I'll do as you request. However, it was not me but Bonwah who endlessly mass deletes edits. I didn't mass delete Bonwah's edits. Also, [[WP:NPOV]] would seem to require the inclusion of a mainstream point-of-view with many reputable references, such as the point-of-view that there are no death panels in a health care bill. Bonwah essentially blocks anyone who isn't a fan from editing the article. Still, I'll do as you request.
[Jimmuldrow]: of such deletions is to block all other points of view, with the pretense that fans \""own\"" a Wikipedia article, which isn't true.
[Jimmuldrow]: That sounds reasonable to me.
[Jimmuldrow]: I tried. I really tried to be fair.
[Jimmuldrow]: Thanks.
[Jimmuldrow]: You certainly don't allow any large number of references to interfere with opinions.
[Jimmuldrow]: All very cool! My fave is, \""Keep your government hands off my Medicare.\"" Speaker at health care reform town hall meeting in Simpsonville, S.C., commenting on the government-created Medicare program, quoted by The Washington Post  on July 28.
[Jimmuldrow]: Imho, it will be awhile before it's any good.
[Jimmuldrow]: I wasn't edit warring, and wasn't even the first to revert one time. I didn't revert two times, much less three times, even in response to someone else. I'm sure you must have some honest intention that I just don't quite realize yet. Have a good day.
[Jimmuldrow]: Also, if I didn't discuss one zillion and one times instead of a zillion, sorry. If you think that Palin's statements about death panels are not very well-documented, well-known and very relevant to many statements made by Palin over a period of years, you are mistaken.
[Jimmuldrow]: Ok. Sounds good."
Debresser,False,"[Debresser]: In the article [[Apagorevmeno]] you bring a reference <nowiki><ref name=\""StarNewsBackstage\""><\/nowiki> You forgot to enter the url. I entered a url which is probably a mirror of the one you mean. Could you please enter the correct one. Thank you.
[Debresser]: That's one thing. Generally YouTube isn't the best source available (as it is self-published). But it is better than nothing. The suggestion of the previous user is a good one in general.
[Debresser]: I wrote about the subject of broken refs in templates\/infoboxes\/etc. in [[Help talk:Cite errors#Broken refs in templates.2Finfoboxes.2Fetc.|Help talk:Cite errors]]. Would you please have a look? I might have made an oversight in some of it, which you would probably catch.
[Debresser]: 
[Debresser]: Just like & #123; gives &#123;, I would like to know how to make [,], and '. Where is there a list of these things? I looked, e.g. in [[Wikipedia:Special_character]], but didn't find what I am looking for.
[Debresser]: Thank you. Isn't there anything on WIkipedia?
[Debresser]: I made a template which I found usefull. When I tried to move it to its proper name, that name turned out to be blacklisted. Then I made a talk page to request the move. Suddenly I had a very big question, related to the template, and I posted it there too. Perhaps you have the answer?
[Debresser]: First of all, thanks a lot for adding the documentation to the template and the explanation on the talk page. Please have another look at the suggestion I made after understanding your words.
[Debresser]: I did some work in the [[:Category:Wikipedia pages with incorrect protection templates]]. Over 180 entries had accumulated there. It brought that down to 9 (see my [[User_talk:Debresser#Protection_templates|talk page]]). There's some 9 left. Part of them need administrator priviliges (which I don't know if you have them). Part of them need a good idea. And 2 of them are actually yours. Smile!
[Debresser]: All 9 of them are gone. Two of them were {{tl|editprotected}} suggestions of mine implemented by admins. Did you take care of yours? If not, somebody else did? Or were the search parameters changed?
[Debresser]: It is nice that people liked the idea, but it seems no great support for making it into a Magic word is forthcoming.
[Debresser]: The reason I didn't do that is because I didn't understand you. We do not use the date in the {{tl|cleanup}} template, just the month, as far as I know.
[Debresser]: {{tl|Khagans of Mongol Empire}} was centered, which stood out strangely among the other templates in this article. I can't get it to the left. If you'll do it, I'll learn. :)
[Debresser]: I have 1 unfixed template loop left in [[:Category:Template loop warnings]]. It is [[User:Will Pittenger\/templates]]. This user is himself an experienced template maker. See [[User_talk:Will_Pittenger#Template_loop|his talk page]] that he also doesn't know how to fix it. The problem doesn't seem to be just technical, more conceptual. Do you have any good ideas?
[Debresser]: This [[Template:Infobox Indian Jurisdiction\/doc|template document page]] needs both a <nowiki>{{Reflist}} and a <references\/> tag<\/nowiki> to show all references. I wouldn't have though of it, but [[User:Wuhwuzdat|Wuhwuzdat]] fixed it. Do you know why this is, and how it can be fixed?
[Debresser]: I've fixed some 30+ articles here. And I've removed from the two lists all entries whose articles had been deleted or whose categories had been created. Have you done any serious work here that I should be aware of?
[Debresser]: Thanks. I noticed that about 5-10% of the categories either gets created in due course or the pages get deleted. And I found a few categories had been fixed or removed by others. So an update will be welcome. In the mean time I'll get started (slowly) on what we have.
[Debresser]: I removed your notice from my talk page, and replaced it with a subsection [[User_talk:Debresser#Redlinked_categories]] as part of a section about my regular [[wp:Wikignoming|wikignoming]]. Just in case you were watching it.
[Debresser]: I made a template {{tl|Monthyear+1}}, showing the name of the month and the year as they will be in another month. I checked it, and it's working fine. I made a small documentation page to go with it. Since you had a look at my previous templates, {{tl|Currentdaymonth}} and {{tl|Currentmonthday}} and their documentation pages, perhaps you'd care to have a look at this one as well. Thanks.
[Debresser]: Now implemented (by [[User:MSGJ|MSGJ]]). Very nice edit! I updated the remark inside the template. I also created {{tl|Monthyear-1}} analogously.
[Debresser]: I also created {{tl|Monthyear}}. See [[User_talk:MSGJ#Time_parser_function]] for a discussion about the use of these templates over using the time parser function itself.
[Debresser]: I updated [[User_talk:Debresser#Currentmonthday|those two old templates]] with this time parser function now.
[Debresser]: As far as I am concerned, by the end of week it would be time for an update. No reason to spend your time on reworking these lists (as in the following section), because many redlinks have already been fixed (removed, created or replaced). I also fixed some 100+ by now, and will fix another 100+ in the next 2 days.
[Debresser]: I saw what you did. That is very nice work! Do I understand correctly that the list is now updated and will constantly be updated (as soon as an article is edited or null-edited or the job-queue gets to it)? [[User:Debresser|Debresser]] ([[User talk:Debresser|talk]]) 09:31, 5 May 2009 (UTC) Where will new articles show up?
[Debresser]: I see. So new articles don't get added automatically. You are serious? There's more than 10,000 articles used with one-time redlinked cats? Incredible!
[Debresser]: You write about categories with remarks in them \""Please do not 'fix' these by simply deleting the comments or moving them outside of the category tag\"". Actually, I think that moving them outside the category tag is '''precisely''' what ''should'' be done and what usually ''is'' done. What do you say?
[Debresser]: Good point.
[Debresser]: I also looked for some notification about a wikibreak. You are highly valued.
[Debresser]: I saw today in [[List of spacewalks since 2000]] that you have not yet taken heed of my previous note.
[Debresser]: Thanks for your note on my talk page. I'll have a look there.
[Debresser]: It seems [[User:Rich Farmbrough|Rich]] had the same idea I did, just two months earlier. He even made a nice [[Wikipedia:List of monthly maintenance categories given month\/cat|help page]] using precisely the same notation. His list is a bit more extensive, logically. I'll just have my page deleted and that's it. Thanks.
[Debresser]: I see. Thanks for using it. I take that as a compliment. He (or the two of you) missed 6 of the categories I have. I'll add them.
[Debresser]: My pleasure. The main thing is to use them, all of them and in time.
[Debresser]: What did you mean with this \""I'd love to see the monthly categories for Category:Categories for deletion included in this standard\""? There are no monthly categories here.
[Debresser]: Did you ever have that look?
[Debresser]: That was pretty shortsighted of me. Ok, done. Now [[User:Rich Farmbrough|Rich]] is doing his part, and then it is just a matter of time till the old categories empty.
[Debresser]: If your an admin, please have alook at my last request [[User_talk:Rich_Farmbrough#Your_input|here]] and please make those edits. I'm not an admin and can't do it myself. But it needs to be done, because I started the process already with three other templates.
[Debresser]: Ok, Rich did it just now. I thought he had gone because he didn't make an edit for over an hour. Sorry for bothering you.
[Debresser]: There are only 30 there. Those are my \""orphans\"". The rest I have with links to their pages. Thanks, I'll be looking out for your reaction.
[Debresser]: It will always be a pleasure to see you around. Have fun and lots of success.
[Debresser]: I fixed it. Sorry.
[Debresser]: I see you removed the info completely now. After I worked so hard onthe ref. :( Well, it's in the infobox also, so I suppose you don't need it in the text also.
[Debresser]: As to [[Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard\/Incidents#More_out_of_process_category_renames]]. Please refrain from adding your comments out of chronological order and stating the precise same thing twice.
[Debresser]: Thank you for your advice. I do try to do so generally. No idea why I din't in this case. I do seem to remember disctinctly that one should refrain from adding posts in the middle of conversations, as you did here. I'll try to find the source.
[Debresser]: I have found [[Wikipedia:Tutorial_(Talk_pages)]], where it says \""When you post a new comment, put it at the bottom of the talk page. The exception is, if you are responding to someone else's remarks, put your comment below theirs.\"" So I sincerely apologise.
[Debresser]: I saw your edit to [[Thomas M. Davis]]. Why did you move {{tl|Lifetime}} down. It is mostly placed at the top of the categories, just as <nowiki>{{DEFAULTSORT}}<\/nowiki>. {{tl|Lifetime}} includes <nowiki>{{DEFAULTSORT}}<\/nowiki> and the year of birth and year of death categories, which are always on top.
[Debresser]: I see. Thank you.
[Debresser]: Nevertheless I usually see categories like date of birth (and death) on top. This includes the {{tl|Lifetime}} template. The reason may be that these are obvious categories when searching for appropriate categories for an article.
[Debresser]: It seems somebody mentioned this just a few days ago at [[Template_talk:Lifetime#Placement]]. Please consider yourself invited to take part in the discussion there.
[Debresser]: I know. Which was a double reason to invite you over. :)
[Debresser]: See [[Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#User:William_Allen_Simpson|here]] for a discussion about an editor who has turned to you in connection with a possible adminship.
[Debresser]: Moreover, why does it use all capitals? That is definitely not Wikipedia standard. Sorry for mixing into the conversation. It turned out I had your talk watched because of my previous posts.
[Debresser]: I really appreciate it.
[Debresser]: You're the '''first''' one whom I have seen doing that. And I have a <u>lot<\/u> of edits. :)
[Debresser]: Thanks. Personally, I think that was a bad idea, but anyway.
[Debresser]: As per [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts&diff=296418307&oldid=296417598 this advise] I opened a thread on [[Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard\/Incidents#User:William_Allen_Simpson]].
[Debresser]: I saw you undid a change of mine in [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categorization_of_people\/boilerplate_fact_policy&diff=next&oldid=298060229 this diff]. Would you please explain why.
[Debresser]: In your last comment on [[Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (categories)]] you made a remark of personal nature. You said \""your track record as shown above is to disparage comments by others\"". I do not understand what you mean. I myself am the victim of an agressive and unpleasant editor (I am referring, of course, to [[User:William Allen Simpson|William Allen Simpson]]), who has been making personal accusations and disparaging comments to me ever since I dared disagree with him, while often completely refraining from adressing the subject at hand. I, on the contrary, always adress the point with arguments and logic, and in a civil way. I am therefore surprised at your words, and - frankly - a little offended by the injustice (not by you personally). If I misunderstood you, please explain.
[Debresser]: As to being on opposite sites in Cfd discussions, believe me that I don't keep track of that. If anything, I have noticed you are an intelligent, carefull editor.
[Debresser]: We all make errors. I have no reason to pick on WAS. It just happens to be that I disagree with a lot of things he does. Where I agree, I also say so (see my opinions in various Cfd's).
[Debresser]: The right place to say so would have been my talkpage. Which would have been the right place for another 50% of your posts in discussions, which are all personal attacks. This being so, I am rather pleased you are taking this to arbitration: since wp:ani and wp:wqa have not helped so far in making you behave civily, maybe ArbCom will.
[Debresser]: I noticed you tagged the article [[Christina Tchen]] as overlinked. I routinely check this category, and so I noticed this. I must say I do not see any irrelevant links in this article. Nor does it seem overly linked to me. It might be that the problem is the other way around: that there should be more text in this article. Anyway, I'd like to ask you to reconsider, or to remove any links you deem superfluous yourself.
[Debresser]: Did you read [[Wikipedia:Red link]]? Based on that, I would say that all redlinks in this article may be kept. I agree with you that is leaves to be desired from an estetic point of view, but I think they are all valid redlinks. Consequently, IMHO, this article is not overlinked.
[Debresser]: What is the meaning of your statement that \""there is no phonemic shva in modern Hebrew\""?
[Debresser]: Please do not remove accessdate parameter in citation templates. The reason you gave for removing them is no reason at all.
[Debresser]: Nowhere does it say to comment them out once they are there! Furthermore, what makes you so sure those sites are stable and maintain their archives for a long time? And saying that \""Retrieved on ....\"" in a ''reference'' (!) is cluttering, is plain exaggeration. And finally, I have never seen any other editor doing such a thing. Which also says something, if you ask me. At the very best (and I actually think this is ''not'' wise), this is an unnecessary thing, and we should not engage in unnecessary things.
[Debresser]: The second date is clearly called \""Retrieved on\"", so I see no possibility for confusion. Webites like the BBC are indeed stable, but even stable websites sometimes overhaul their archives, with dire consequences, usually. Anyway, I still hope in the future you will obstain from this type of edit. You might want to seek a third opinion on [[Template talk:Cite web]].
[Debresser]: It meant the phonetic side of things. Isn't there a [\u0259] in a word like \""lecha\"" (to you)?
[Debresser]: What is the difference? I am not familiar with phonetic writing, just a little. But I ''do' speak Hebrew, and from what I seem to remember, that is a real shva. Could you give examples from English perhaps?
[Debresser]: It is as I suspected. The pronunciation of \""lecha\"" doesn't come close to the sound file at [[close-mid front unrounded vowel]]  but is precisely like in [[mid central vowel]]. So it should be \""l\u0259\u02c8\u03c7a\"". You said you have citations saying otherwise?
[Debresser]: I asked the question [[Talk:Hebrew_phonology#Shva|there]].
[Debresser]: I saw your last edit to [[User:DH85868993\/sandbox4]]. Do you want to have this page deleted?
[Debresser]: I seconded wholeheartedly your proposal at [[Template_talk:Citation#Format_for_accessdate]]. Could you please add a link to the discussion?
[Debresser]: Ok. I found it, and added the link myself.
[Debresser]: It seems we agree on more than we disagree about.
[Debresser]: I agree with you on that as well, but I think all big steps have to be broken down into minor ones. {{para|accessmonthday}} and {{para|accessdaymonth}} are now deprecated and exstinct. {{para|accessday}}, {{para|accessmonth}} and {{para|accessyear}} will follow within the next few weeks. Then let's wait a year or so, and see what we can do then.
[Debresser]: I have started with the step-by-step deprecation of those parameters. And it will please you to know that in doing so, I also update documentation pages. The changes I make include removing the recommendation for ISO format, moving the accessdate parameter down in the list of parameters to diminish its importance, and change its status from \""recommended\"" to \""optional\"". Just give me two weeks to work quietly, and in time the difference will be substantial.
[Debresser]: This formulation is now final, and contains elements used on {{tl|Tfd2}}\/{{tl|Tfm2}} documentation pages and {{tl|Tfd}}\/{{tl|Tfm}} templates > Instructions.
[Debresser]: Why did you strike \""FC MVD Rossii Moscow\"" in [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Template:Russian_First_Division&diff=prev&oldid=305996534 this edit] to the [[Template:Russian First Division]]?
[Debresser]: Thank you for your reply. It would be better to add an asteriks with a note explaining this. The way it is now, it looks like vandalism.
[Debresser]: Well, for a [[Template:Russian Second Division|second division]] that may do, but not for a [[Template:Russian First Division|first division]]. :)
[Debresser]: This has been done now.
[Debresser]: I really disagree with your addition of [[Template:Title disambig text]] to the See also section of [[Template:Str right\/doc]], but am not going to edit war over that. Please note that I have extensively updated the documentation page of [[Template:Title disambig text]], which has also resulted in it becoming more like the documentation pages of [[Template:Str right]] and its related templates.

[Debresser]: I see [[user:AnomieBOT|AnomieBOT]] just did [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=List_of_accidents_and_incidents_involving_military_aircraft_(pre-1950)&diff=322195691&oldid=322026537 that].
[Debresser]: I am completely new at this. I saw you declined the request of \""Welcomefrye\"" because it is to much like \""Welcome frye\"". But welcome frye was created in 2006 and never even had an edit. So why did you not create the account?
[Debresser]: I am completely new at this. I saw you declined the request of \""Welcomefrye\"" because it is to much like \""Welcome frye\"". But welcome frye was created in 2006 and never even had an edit. So why did you not create the account?
[Debresser]: In such a case an account creation admin could still create the account (according to [[Wikipedia:ACCG#If_the_account_is_too_similar|the documentation]]). So I would have deferred this case to them.

[Debresser]: [http:\/\/stable.toolserver.org\/acc\/acc.php Account creation request interface]
[Debresser]: After clicking \""by e-mail\"" I should not press \""Create account\"" as well, is that correct?
[Debresser]: After clicking \""by e-mail\"" I should not press \""Create account\"" as well, is that correct?
[Debresser]: I created my first two accounts, without any \""interesting\"" cases. Did I miss the action?
[Debresser]: I created my first two accounts, without any \""interesting\"" cases. Did I miss the action?
[Debresser]: No problem. Thank you, for taking care of the follow-up.
[Debresser]: You are having a lot of error messages connected with references in this article, [[Friedrich Welwitsch]]. I hope you will fix them.
[Debresser]: In [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Mitochondrial_Eve&diff=prev&oldid=324168750 this edit] from you added a reference <code><nowiki><ref name=\""Takahata1999\""\/><\/nowiki><\/code> to [[Mitochondrial Eve]]. Could you please go back and fill in the details, or tell me where you found this reference? Thank you,
[Debresser]: Good luck. I just wanted to make sure you knew about these errors.
[Debresser]: Thank you.
[Debresser]: Was your last edit to [[Template_talk:Cite_news#archiveurl_without_original_url_old_papers]] really true? I don't think so. And even if it were, there is no need to start bickering about such trivia.
[Debresser]: I wanted to say it again in these words, and point out the fact that it is clearly in the documentation. Thanks for removing that. I appreciate it.
[Debresser]: I appreciate your follow-up on [[User_talk:Debresser#Judaism_dispute|my talk page]]. All the best to you as well.
[Debresser]: I have removed (almost) all duplicate internal links from [[Inventions in medieval Islam]], and a few other trivial ones as well. If there are any more links you think should be removed, please feel free to do so. I will soon do the same on [[Medicine in medieval Islam]] as well.
[Debresser]: BTW, I am just a [[Wikipedia:Wikignome|wikignome]], watching a dozen of maintenance categories, including [[:Category:Articles with too many wikilinks]].
[Debresser]: [[Template:Wireless systems]] should be merged into [[Template:Mobile telecommunications standards]]. Such was the conclusion of a discussion at [[WP:TFD]], but none of us involved has the knowledge to actually do so. Since you have of late edited both template, perhaps you you do this, or help me do it?
[Debresser]: Thank you for trying to help me. Unfortunately, this is all Chinese to me. Perhaps you'll have more time in the future.
[Debresser]: Just in case you aren't watching that page any more after making the change, see [[Template_talk:Information#Bring_one_parameter_in_line_-_request]].
[Debresser]: There is a good reason for tagging articles without references. but please do not create empty reference sections, because they look ugly. And use {{Tl|Unreferenced}}, to which {{Tl|Unsourced}} is a redirect anyway. And please take into account to write names of months in full, to avoid error messages. Sorry for telling you so many \""what to do's\"", but I am sure that you want to do it right. Sincerely,
[Debresser]: There were some 7-8 articles like this I fixed yesterday. See e.g.[[Wang Xiaobo]].
[Debresser]: Thank you for that merge. And for the good-looking result.
[Debresser]: I have a proposal. Let's try and get bring our case to somebody we both don't know, and let him decide for us.
[Debresser]: By all means feel free to do so. That does not, however, in any way diminish the discrimination inherent in and the logical fallcy of your assertment that \""a haredi source can not be reliable\"".
[Debresser]: What do you say about my proposal to ask an uninvolved party about our disagreement?
[Debresser]: Bedankt. Thanks for the attempt at Dutch.
[Debresser]: I saw you proposed merging [[Template:Meta disambig]] and [[Template:WP disambig]]. The best way to propose merging templates is not with {{Tl|Merge}} tags, but to put it up at [[Wikipedia:Templates for discussion]] with a {{Tl|Tfm}} tag. If you'd do that, I'd support that proposal. You could do the technical side of the merge if needed?
[Debresser]: Could you solve the issue at [[Template_talk:Userspace_draft#Include.2Fnoinclude_cleanup]]? We want to include the template on its documentation page without having that documentation page categorised by the template. Sounds like a case of category surpression.
[Debresser]: Somebody did it yesterday, see the history. It is messy, that is true.
[Debresser]: Likewise there is some discussion at [[Template_talk:Tfd-inline#Full_size_box_in_template_namespace]], where [[Template:Tfd-inline]] is categorising itself and its documenttation. Could you please fix that as well?
[Debresser]: This last one was solved by deprecating Tfd-inline.
[Debresser]: Same from me!
[Debresser]: Since I didn't know what to think of the rational for your removal of that paragraph in [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Nastassja_Kinski&diff=363436284&oldid=363428670 this edit] to [[Nastassja Kinski]], I asked for instruction on [[Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons\/Noticeboard#Nastassja_Kinski]]. I just though to drop you a note.
[Debresser]: Glad you [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Nastassja_Kinski&diff=364194150&oldid=364192503 added a source], but that source seems a Wikipedia mirror.
[Debresser]: Actually, the source later on in that same paragraph says clearly \""Quincy Jones, who she lived with for four years until 1995\"". So I updated the article. I hope we are both satisfied now.
[Debresser]: That link ([[WP:EGG]]) is not specific enough to revert a common accepted way of linking. Sorry, but consensus is obviously not as [[User:IllaZilla|IllaZilla]] claims.
[Debresser]: In addition I wish you a speedy and complete recovery from your surgery. All the best,
[Debresser]: It seems this editor is having a problem here. Without going into details, I'd like to call upon him to emulate the standard behavior of Wikipedia editors in this regard.
[Debresser]: I made the change in [[Wikipedia:Stub]] based on that old discussion. And removed the instruction and the link from [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (layout)]], since the discussion came to quite the opposite conclusion, as you rightfully mentioned.
[Debresser]: I'd like to ask you to lower the protection level of [[Template:Lead too short]] to semi-protection. Of all the [[:Category:Introduction cleanup maintenance templates]] it is the only one with full protection. Comparison with the edit history of the other templates in that category, and the fact that most of them are not even semi-protected, leads to think that full protection is not needed here.
[Debresser]: Which I will do then, with your permission. Thanks for responding.
[Debresser]: [[Wikipedia:AWB]] should not be used for trivial edits like [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Category:Pages_missing_lead_section&diff=409508925&oldid=408537682 this one].
[Debresser]: Happens to the best of us. :)
[Debresser]: I just don't think it is worth the trouble. If any specific user would be making ''onlyy'' such edits, he'll get a slap on the wrist. Otherwise we all sometimes make such edits.
[Debresser]: I don't understand the reason for [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Avraham_Chaim_Naeh&diff=425595076&oldid=409923922 this edit]. Would you please explain it to me?
[Debresser]: I agree with the previous editor on this one.
[Debresser]: The problem seems to be that Palestinian here is supposed to designate a country, while it sounds like an ethnicity. How to solve that problem?
[Debresser]: I still think we can keep Category:Rabbis in Ottoman and British Palestine and not split it up any more.
[Debresser]: The general [[:Category:Palestinian rabbis]] category is a soft redirect to the even more general [[:Category:Rabbis of the Land of Israel]]. The issue is with the century-specific categories. I think these should be restored to the general [[:Category:Rabbis in Ottoman and British Palestine]] category (or whatever other subcategory of [[:Category:Rabbis of the Land of Israel]] which is appropriate).
[Debresser]: As mentioned above. The fact that somebody is a rabbi in a country does not mean he has the local nationality. Especially since many (or even most) of them were not born there. Also there is too much confusion with the term Palestine being an ethnicity and not a geographical location. In addition, and specifically, during the 13th century, the place was definitely not called Palestine. In general, I think you made a mistake when you created all these categories and started populating them without discussion!
[Debresser]: Please stop creating all kinds of \""palestinian\"" categories while you see there are serious objections aginst it. If you do not seek consensus first, I will have to take this to [[wp:ani]].
[Debresser]: Well, you can't create a whole group of categories, using a controversial term, then substitute existing categories with your categories, while this is being protested on your talk page, and then say you're not the bad guy...
[Debresser]: I have reverted your addition of this category to several articles, as well as blanked the category page. You ''have to'' stop doing this kind of thing until those discussions are decided. And since they will ''not'' be decided in your favor, you will just have to stop this - period.
[Debresser]: Go ahead. You will find out that you are wrong.
[Debresser]: I am really not an expert. I know about the Israeli Karaite community. There are Karaites in the Crimea as well, historically, but I doubt whether they are organised into any sort of a community. I'll try to look around at the karaite websites, and if needed, will adjust the text of the article accordingly.
[Debresser]: See [[Karaites#Karaite_Judaism_by_region]] that there are various Karaite communities. I also found quite a few English karaite websites, including one of [http:\/\/www.karaites.org\/ Karaite Jews of America]. Nevertheless, the [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Religion_in_Israel&diff=430645884&oldid=430579137 resulting edit] was a surprising one. See the editsummary for an explanation.
[Debresser]: # I understand the point made by IZAK as to \""Lithuanian\"" Judaism. The point he seems to be missing is that \""Lithuanian\"" here is not meant as a strictly geographical denominator, but rather has become the name for a branch of modern Judaism. He might know it better as \""Litvishe\"" or simply \""misnagdim\"". I think we could make a \""[[Lithuanian Judaism]]\"" page, but that it should be a redirect to [[misnagdim]].
[Debresser]: When I checked the link to \""Lithuanian Judaism\"", it lead to [[Lithuanian Jews]], and that article already has a hatnote saying \""For the historical Rabbinic opposition to Hasidic Judaism from the 1700s, centred in Lithuania, see [[Misnagdim]]\"". Which I think is adequate enough.
[Debresser]: Thank you for the notification. I have replied [[Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard\/Incidents#Debresser_nominates_Palestinian_rabbis_for_category_for_deletion|there]].
[Debresser]: I have placed a [[Template:Uw-disruptive1|warning template]] on your talkpage for repeating a below-standard edit. That is called disruptive editing, and may lead to a block.
[Debresser]: I don't see your warning template anywhere...? In any case, please don't be childish. Your edit was below standard. Your last edit ''was'' up to standard, and is therefore not reverted. Your contribution to the content of this article is appreciated.
[Debresser]: Please don't leave me such stupid messages. You have returned to your controversial and non-consensus editing and adding of categories. I asked you be blocked in the [[Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard\/Incidents#Ask_for_block|WP:ANI]] discussion.
[Debresser]: I dislike your walking the edges, but have no real problem with adding a link to [[Palestine]] to the name of cities. Please see [[Palestine#Ottoman_rule_.281516.E2.80.931831_AD.29]] that the name Palestine was  not the official of the region since the beginning of Ottoman rule in the 16th century.
[Debresser]: I think you should use [[Ottoman Palestine]], not [[Palestine]]. If I notice other editors making that change, I think your edits will have to be modified. If not, I'll not push on this one, since there is something to say for it. If only you weren't such a [[WP:PUSH|pusher]].
[Debresser]: Do not change my post to [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Judaism#Palestinian_rabbi]]. You can add that image, even though it is of no use there, '''below''' my post only.
[Debresser]: 1. I changed that redirect now, see the editsummary for the rationale. 2. Even while it was still a redirect to \""Palestine\"", it would still be better to use \""Ottoman Palestine\"", since it is always good to be precise.
[Debresser]: Not only does it bother me, it is a violation of Wikipedia guidelines. And so is [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Judaism&curid=796701&diff=435973836&oldid=435970651 this editsummary]. Ever see [[WP:CIVIL]]?
[Debresser]: Read again, and on [[Wikipedia:User warning templates]], that it says \""editing\"" and \""refactoring\"", not only \""deleting\"".
[Debresser]: Like the Lord striking me with lightening? There are no games. I am just trying to stop you pushing certain edits and behaving any way you like. And I do so in respect for your person and the good things you do on Wikipedia. I'd like to be able to say I feel the same attitude from your side.
[Debresser]: Yes, of course. The parameters are deprecated, but are still sometimes used. As you can see in [[:Category:Pages containing cite templates with deprecated parameters|the related category]]. That is why we have the detection on some 20 citation templates. If you know for a fact that they aren't in use on any of the instances of [[Template:London Gazette]], I think they could be safely removed, because it is unlikely they will be added still. But I have no such information.
[Debresser]: If you have checked, then I have no serious problem with removing the detection. Or using the code and category for other parameters. By all means.
[Debresser]: You are right, we created the category for specific parameters. But we have added to them as the need arose. So feel free to use it for some other parameters as well. Just that I wouldn't change the documentation for parameters used on only one template.
[Debresser]: Sure. And I noticed that even parameters which are being detected on only one template are added to the documentation page.
[Debresser]: For what it's worth, in my personal opinion the subject of our disagreement - see [[Category talk:16th-century Palestinian rabbis]] - is not related to the Arab-Israeli conflict. I for one, do not see it so. But the banning admin might take a different stance on that issue. I suggest you take it up with him. Feel free to quote my opinion to him. [[User:Georgewilliamherbert|Georgewilliamherbert]], who topic banned you (and me) from \""Israeli \/ Palestinian topic areas\"" for 72 hours in [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Chesdovi&diff=427001218&oldid=426961385 this edit] obviously thinks differently about this.
[Debresser]: Now I see the source of the misunderstanding. I was referring to the dictionary entry you brought there. I replied that it proves rather the contrary. I didn't mean the chief-rabbi section at all.
[Debresser]: The question of \""why?\"" is superfluous. Obviously there is good reason. But in fact I have though of a better idea, which I have implemented on some other page already. And which has the advantage of not giving the impression that this is your private page. Give me a few minutes, and I'll take care f it.
[Debresser]: Hi, Lotje. Sorry, but I can't but automatically like a person with your name. I'm Dutch, and I have the fondest memories for girls with that name. Anyway, what I did was move a space from inside an internal link to outside it: <nowiki>[[Hebrew ]] -> [[Hebrew]] .<\/nowiki> See? Or was you question more of general, philosophical nature?
[Debresser]: Sorry, but I disagree. I think the discussion was closed correctly before when the category was deleted. And I don't see much agreement with Chesdovi's point of view anyway. So I think we should not wait for him, but close the issue as it was. In addition, a banned editor should not try to return to previous disagreements right after the end of his ban.
[Debresser]: Dear Yobot operator. If you really think that [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Diamond_Star&diff=437052698&oldid=391202652 this] was an important enough change to make an edit, then I recommend you use a capital next time: names of Wikipedia pages are spelled with a capital. That is: {{Tl|Disambiguation}}.
[Debresser]: Setting aside your general advise, and sticking to the issue at hand. You are right that userfying was a bad move. But making a draft in article namespace is definitely something that falls under the category of things that need to be fixed. Talkpages and article mainspace pages are treated differently by various templates, and the only place to make a draft is in article namespace. I was doing some fairly standard work on maintenance categories. Your draft was only one of 14. So please, do not blow up this thing out of proportion. And in the future, make sure to choose the right namespace for your drafts. Did you consult with other editors when choosing talkpage namespace...? I thought so...
[Debresser]: Good. Note that [[User:SmackBot]] also capitalizes template names. And so is my personal custom.
[Debresser]: I see no reason to be stuck with a discussion which is decided as it is for possibly up to a year because of this. If anything, Chesdovi's ban lends argument to my opinion, that he is a [[WP:PUSH|pushy]] and [[WP:TE|tendentious]] editor, and that all his arguing in this matter is just another example of both these traits. And again, I see a clear consensus disagreeing with Chesdovi. In short, I don't view his ban as a great loss to the community (in effect, the community seems to deem it the best way of resolving a problem), and think we should go on doing the right thing. Sorry to hack Chesdovi's talkpage in such a way, and to write such negative things about him. It's a bit of a chutzpe, but then, that is probably justice. In any case, I do appreciate his positive contributions, but agree with the community decision that at this moment we are better off without him.
[Debresser]: I do not understand your indignation. I have no reason to ask you nor inform you about any edit I wish to make to an article, which - after all - that page is. Especially not since we are talking about a simple maintenance edit. ''That'' is the way Wikipedia works: you make an edit, I make an edit. Only if an edit is likely to be controversial, is it wise to discuss it first, and even then usually one finds out only afterwards that it was a controversial edit. And even then there is [[WP:BRD|being bold]]. Please study [[WP:OWN]].
[Debresser]: Actually, if you had marked out the categories, I wouldn't have noticed, and this discussion wouldn't have taken place. I am surprised by the advise to use talkpage namespace, even then. The main thing is you are aware now that I was just doing some regular cleanup, without any intention to disregard your efforts.
[Debresser]: Your second edit was to change the fact that Asimov identified himself as a non-observant Jew to that he was an atheist. Although he was an atheist, the source says very clearly \""I am a non-observant Jew\"". However you want to understand those words, these are what he said! In Wikipedia we mention sexual orientation, and ethnic and religious affiliation as self-identified by the subjects of the articles (this is a documented [[Wikipedia:WikiProject LGBT studies\/Guidelines|guideline]]), not by the way some chaotic druid (speaking of atheists) understands it.
[Debresser]: And since you ask, the reason I didn't initiate [[WP:BRD|discussion]] is because your edits are so completely unacceptable in view of these simple arguments. I fact, I checked a few of your other edits, just to make sure your weren't some vandal or anti-semite. Which may serve you as an indication how far off I consider those two edits of yours.
[Debresser]: I did not accuse you of antisemitism, so no apology will be forthcoming in that respect. If you don't like my sense of humor in regard to your username, then don't write me on my talkpage. Here I am free to apply my sense of humor. If you had written on the talkpage of the article, I would not have made that pun. Therefore and in addition to this, your copying of this discussion there in its entirety was inappropriate, and I will note so there.
[Debresser]: Hi. I noticed you gave some attention to [[Cindy Dolenc]]. Perhaps you'd like to comment on [[Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion\/Cindy_Dolenc]] as well?
[Debresser]: 
[Debresser]: I see you made the edit. Very well.
[Debresser]: I noticed you have been involved in a discussion about the example of Eskimo\/Inuit on [[Wikipedia:Categorization\/Ethnicity, gender, religion and sexuality]]. I have simply removed this example from that page, and so resolved the issue.
[Debresser]: I noticed you have been involved in a discussion about the example of Eskimo\/Inuit on [[Wikipedia:Categorization\/Ethnicity, gender, religion and sexuality]]. I have simply removed this example from that page, and so resolved the issue.
[Debresser]: Please explain your removal of the category unsourced template from [[Arna Mer-Khamis]].
[Debresser]: As you can see, [[:Category:Palestinian Jews]] here on Wikipedia does not include all the hundreds of Jews born in this area before 1948. Self-identification, as in the case of Arna's son [[Juliano Mer-Khamis]], [[Uri Davis]] or [[Ilan Halevi]], does seem to be an accepted criteria. As well as, of course, citizenship, as in the case of [[Daniel Barenboim]].
[Debresser]: Actually, I added the template some while ago, and if no sources can be found that she self-identified as such, or that she held Palestinian nationality, I think the category should be removed.
[Debresser]: I don't think that at this moment additional explanation is needed on the category page, since 1. the category is a subcategory of [[:Category:Jews by country]], and 2. the small size and nature of the articles in it make the point, as I explained to you above with success.
[Debresser]: I have your talkpage watched.
[Debresser]: Please see [[Wikipedia_talk:Categorization\/Ethnicity,_gender,_religion_and_sexuality#HIV.2B]] again, where I have asked a question about your recent edit.
[Debresser]: Replied on user's talkpage.
[Debresser]: In addition, what do you say about the section just above this one (now archive and linked [[User_talk:Debresser\/Archive_7#May_2011|here]])?
[Debresser]: The [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] was definitely a country in the modern sense of the word.
[Debresser]: An even better solution.
[Debresser]: Well, it was spamish, so to say. We definitely can't have every factory give its recipe. Especially since most will be the same (flour and water alone).
[Debresser]: I made some small edits to the page, like removing internal links to years and dates (see [[Wikipedia:MOSDATE#Linking_and_autoformatting_of_dates|WP:MOS]], added categories, and a few requests for clarification of terms or statements.
[Debresser]: Could you please explain why you remove unused parameter from infoboxes, like in [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Point_Valid&curid=22682578&diff=440196497&oldid=439112784 this edit]. As long as it is there, it is easy for editors to add the information.
[Debresser]: Logical. Good luck.
[Debresser]: I don't know whether I agree with the ''need'' for mediation. We have a simple argument: should \""Palestine\"" be used in Wikipedia categories for denoting people (including Jews) who lived in this area during any age, as in the categories Chesdovi created of late, or should it be considered a nationality or ethnicity category, as it was till now? Isn't this a question for Cfd?
[Debresser]: I noticed it after I pressed the edit button, and I ''really'' didn't need anybody to remind me about it.
[Debresser]: It happens every once in a while, and I dislike it myself when it happens. Irritating me by nudging is not going to make a difference, apart from - obviously - irritating me.
[Debresser]: I have, and rightfully so. And other editors have done precisely the same, in that article and other ones. Perhaps Dweller is right, and an Rfc is the next step. I see no need for mediation, since the issue is not a personal one. (At least, not for me. Personal attacks and incivility from Chesdovi have been noted at [[WP:WQA]].)
[Debresser]: No. But I do think you are going to lengths to irritate me. On my own talkpage. Please refrain from posting here, until you have something nice to say, unless absolutely necessary.
[Debresser]: But I do think having them on different lines helps to make the template more readily understandable.
[Debresser]: I have removed quite some whitelines from templates over the years.
[Debresser]: I saw [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Template:Cite_book\/doc&curid=6915751&diff=441160268&oldid=439626915 this] warning you added today. Can't the problem be fixed somehow in the Harvard references? What can you tell me about the problem? In general there has been an effort to leave the usage of \""day\"", \""month\"" and \""year\"" in favor of \""date\"", whenever possible. I think it is worthwhile to make an effort to continue with that, and this warning doesn't fit in that. And especially if there is some problem, then we should try to fix it. You may write here, I\""ll watch your page.
[Debresser]: I see. If so, it's above my abilities to fix this, unfortunately. Thanks for your reply.
[Debresser]: Truth is elusive, and there is much to say for being smart also. If you get my drift.
[Debresser]: Which template adds [[:Category:Wikipedia maintenance categories with missing months]]?
[Debresser]: Ok, found it. [[Template:DeletedMonths\/month]].
[Debresser]: That was #100 in [[Wikipedia:List of monthly maintenance categories given month]].
[Debresser]: Btw, you might want to get familiar with the two simplifications in [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Template:Dablinks&diff=next&oldid=441309155 this edit], using functions of {{Tl|Ambox}}.
[Debresser]: I'd like to ask you, why do we need the all-inclusive category [[:Category:All pages with excessive dablinks]]?
[Debresser]: I asked, because I found [[Template:WMCSBM1]] and a few other templates in that category. Finding a template in a category of categories was what led me to think that perhaps you should add something like <code><nowiki>{{#ifeq:{{NAMESPACE}}|Category|etc.}}<\/nowiki><\/code> to the code of [[Template:DeletedMonths\/month]].
[Debresser]: I made the [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Template:DeletedMonths\/month&diff=441339143&oldid=307343672 change] I proposed, and the templates are gone. So that part seems to have worked. I hope there are no other aversive effects?
[Debresser]: In addition, and with an eye on the future again, \""Use\"" categories like these \""Use English language\"" templates, and the \""Use date format\"" templates, are first candidates for using {{Tl|Monthly maintenance category}} instead of {{Tl|Monthly clean-up category}}, since they are not about \""clean-up\"", and I think that one of the differences between them should be that a backlog notice is not appropriate in them.
[Debresser]: Please notice that I have added some new categories to [[Wikipedia:List of monthly maintenance categories given month]]. I found them because they used {{Tl|Parent monthly clean up category}}, while not being in that list. There are now 112 of them. If there are any more, or you will add any more in the future, please let me know, or add them yourself.
[Debresser]: Do you have a better answer than that? We don't create categories on Wikipedia just because we can.
[Debresser]: In view if the fact that you have not brought any reason to have this category, I have removed the category from the template, and will delete the category as soon as it is empty.
[Debresser]: Actually, it is me who is surprised by your hostility. Please don't take it personal, but, as I said, if the category serves no purpose, then we shouldn't have it.
[Debresser]: You refuse to answer a question, I make an edit, and then you run to WP:ANI...
[Debresser]: As per advice of 3rd party editor on the WP:ANI-thread you opened, I'd like to ask you if perhaps you have another reply to my original post?
[Debresser]: The only problem is its seeming redundancy. Which is a good reason not to have it. Unless you could give me a reason to have it. Which is precisely what I asked the first time around.
[Debresser]: Having an all-inclusive category is just as standard as not having it. As to the two reasons you mention: If people like to choose, then it is logical to choose from the oldest monthly category first, and work your way through them. And bots don't need all-inclusive categories, they can pick from the monthly subcategories. But, after all is said and done, if you feel these are pressing reasons to keep it, feel free to undo my removal of the all-inclusive category from the template.
[Debresser]: You may delete [[User:Avicennasis\/catpage]]. It is not needed any more.
[Debresser]: Next time just be less hostile, and no mediation will be needed. You did notice that your replies were labeled by both admins as less than helpful?
[Debresser]: Your efforts are much appreciated.
[Debresser]: Is it? It is becoming bigger and bigger. But complex? Yesterday I had a fight with someone who recently created a template and a category. You helped him here. About his all-inclusive category. [[User_talk:JaGa#All_category_for_Dablinks]]. And I do think these 112 names should be more standardised (compare ''in need of'', ''needing'', ''which need'', ''that need''). And perhaps templates Fix and DMCA are all superfluous in maintenance templates and could be replaced by the enhanced Ambox. But so far these are just dreams of mine.
[Debresser]: I see you are adding a ''clean-up'' parameter. I'd create a [[Template:Parent monthly maintenance category]] also, with that same parameter. And then as one of the first things, I'd remove the backlog from it. Btw, should [[Template:Parent monthly clean up category]] be moved to [[Template:Parent monthly clean-up category|Template:Parent monthly clean'''-'''up category]]? I could help you do this, but do not want to intrude upon what I consider \""your\"" projects.
[Debresser]: If you'd ask me what I really think, if I were to design it. I'd do it the other way around. Use only the term \""maintenance template\"" and a parameter called \""clean-up\"" to add a backlog e.g. After all, clean-up is also maintenance.
[Debresser]: And I'd add that new substitution detection that was developed no so long ago to all maintenance templates. Forgot about that one.
[Debresser]: And what can be done so that the backlog message should not be displayed like in that example I gave above when there were only two articles?
[Debresser]: Just move [[Template:Parent monthly maintainance category]] to [[Template:Parent monthly maintenance category]]. And shouldn't the clean-up parameter be added to [[Template:Monthly clean-up category\/outer core]] also to make it work?
[Debresser]: What does \""facile\"" mean in English. I know it only in French \""easy\"". Does it mean \""overly simplifying\""? I of course understand your point.
[Debresser]: I think it does. Just that the progress-box is pushing it. Or please show me an example of what you mean.
[Debresser]: Smile. Btw, I made [[Template:Parent monthly clean-up category]] as a redirect. Perhaps in time, it could come to replace it.
[Debresser]: You're right. Fix should stay for inline templates. Nobody ever tried to merge the Ambox, Tmbox, Ombox, Mbox etc. templates?
[Debresser]: Did you see what I wrote about the way I would design it, the other way around?
[Debresser]: Yes they do. I checked that before I wrote you. Could you show me an example? Perhaps a screenshot?
[Debresser]: You want to say that it's not worth the time. That may be so. I personally like to do things the right way, even if that would take a lot of time. If I were an admin and could edit protected pages, I'd have no problem doing all of this. Including the work to bots.
[Debresser]: Replied on user talkpage.
[Debresser]: I undid your edit [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Template:More_footnotes\/doc&diff=441529132&oldid=427207630 here]. These lists of redirects on template documentation are very important to assist bot owners in programming their bots with all the necessary variations of a template.
[Debresser]: Another thing is that I think we should have a bot clean up all redirects and remove them afterwards. But that is a personal sentiment which I believe is not shared by most editors.
[Debresser]: You seem to lean a little towards my idea of deleting part of these redirects, possibly after replacing them?
[Debresser]: I never considered that. That having a list of redirects could stimulate making more redirects. I always thought these lists were the results of moves and merges. And I don't think that the danger of these lists stimulating creation of other redirects is very real, to be frank.
[Debresser]: Quite awful indeed.
[Debresser]: Not at all. Thanks for dropping a note.
[Debresser]: I see you are adding the code <code><nowiki>|symbol=underground<\/nowiki><\/code>. It would be better to add it to a separate line.
[Debresser]: Could you help him with [[User_talk:Rcsprinter123#Adding_symbol|this]]? I think I'd have no problem with it, but you are the expert.
[Debresser]: I also think it is possible. I asked an expert to help you. Because it really should be on a separate line, like all parameters.
[Debresser]: Please feel free to use my page for testing.
[Debresser]: Just to remind you of [[Talk:27_Club#Request_edit:_Sortable_list]]. The article is now only semi-protected. Afterwards, please set the {{Para|answered}} parameter to \""yes\"". Thak you.
[Debresser]: The thing is: in this case you're just plain wrong. You don't have to like it, but that is the truth. I am telling you so as an experienced and uninvolved editor. And your insistence to revert and discuss when the issue is clear-cut, I perceive as an attempt to edit-war.
[Debresser]: Agree. A misunderstanding from my side. But some good came out of it, that you fixed the position of the reference. Keep up the good work.
[Debresser]: Will answer on user talkpage.
[Debresser]: Answered. Gist of answer: user does not (yet) know how to edit templates. Above post testifies to this. Sorry.
[Debresser]: Sure we can. That's why I had to undo another three of your edits to templates, that you made after this discussion... Sigh.
[Debresser]: It seems you are also not familiar with the rules of [[Wikipedia:Cat#Non-diffusing_subcategories|Categorising]].
[Debresser]: I see. Thank you.
[Debresser]: I see. Magioladitis, that would mean, that the reason I referred to isn't true any more. So perhaps indeed some of the less plausible redirects could be removed.
[Debresser]: And? Just interesting whether I am right and all works fine.
[Debresser]: But both [[:Category:Use Canadian English from August 2011]] and [[:Category:Wikipedia monthly maintenance categories that are empty]] are empty...
[Debresser]: We'll take care of them. I thought so.
[Debresser]: [[:Category:Wikipedia monthly maintenance categories that are empty]] isn't empty any more. It now has some July categories. But no August categories. Which means things are working the way they are supposed to be, if you ask me. Another thing is that I noticed that July categories don't exhibit the speedy deletion notice the way June or older categories do. I'll ask Rich Farmbrough why that is. I'd like to ask you to keep things the way they are in the mean time.
[Debresser]: Please see [[User_talk:Avicennasis#User:Avicennasis.2Fcatpage]], where I ask the question why empty maintenance categories from June auto-nominate for speedy, but July categories don't. It seems they have to be 2 months old to self-nominate, and I wonder why that is. Not technically but ideologically, I mean. Why not nominate July categories as well?
[Debresser]: I asked him [[User_talk:Rich_Farmbrough#Empty_July_categories|here]], but [[Wikimania]] is going ot keep him from answering for some time.
[Debresser]: Interesting. I mean the suspected reason the August categories showed up at first. I see two possible ways of fixing that, apart from a null-edit. 1. Time heals all wounds, and it is possible that they would have disappeared by themselves within a few hours or days. 2. Future categories could be excluded. Although that does not make sense, because it goes contrary to the whole idea of this category. Perhaps Rich will have some other idea, when he'll get around to looking at this.
[Debresser]: Please see there on Avicennasis' talkpage, that [[:Category:Wikipedia monthly maintenance categories that are empty]] receives August categories during the last hours of July, and what can be done to remove them later on.
[Debresser]: Does anything populate [[:Category:Articles with ibid]]? What is this category for, precisely?
[Debresser]: I noticed [[:Category:Wikipedians having been offered adoption]] using [[Template:Adopt offer]] is being dated. I had to do quite some maintenance there. Interestingly, [[:Category:Wikipedians having been offered adoption]] using [[Template:Adoptme]] is ''not'' dated, even though it is a lot bigger, and dating it to create a backlog idea seems logical. I'll take care of that in the evening.
[Debresser]: Interesting. This template is in use, but the categories are all empty. I'll look into this tonight, and fix it.
[Debresser]: It is because of a mistake Rich made in his last edit to this template. {{Tl|Ambox}} does not take a \""cat-date\"" but does the same with \""cat\"" and \""date\"". He made this mistake in another template also. This template is fully protected, so if Rich or any admin could please change {{Para|cat-date}} to just {{Para|cat}}.
[Debresser]: I added the date parameter to {{Tl|Adoptme}}, and then I noticed something strange. See [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User:Bad4nr&diff=prev&oldid=431410735 this edit]. There is some type of timestamp there. And I noticed the same on other userpages. How did these users know how to put such a timestamp there? And in view of that, should it be replaced by a date parameter and monthly categories?
[Debresser]: If there is, we'll find it as well.
[Debresser]: In the mean time let me ask you, is SmackBot checking for [[Template:Adopt offer]]?
[Debresser]: Ok. Did you get my e-mail? I am Friday-Saturday (and perhaps also Sunday) in Haifa, for business of my own. But would be thrilled to meet you (and others, of course). My phone number is in that mail.
[Debresser]: It took me some searching and thinking to fix [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Template:Monthly_clean-up_category\/Messages\/Wikipedians_having_been_offered_adoption&diff=442716420&oldid=442666397 this], e.g.
[Debresser]: Very well. You sort it out. Then just let me know. Of course it would be nice to have an hour or so at our disposal, to sit down and have a drink somewhere. But just shaking hands and exchange a few words will also do. :) Give me a call or a text-message to let me know what and when would be convenient for you.
[Debresser]: I prefer to have clear positions. Your position wasn't that clear in the discussion, but your comment here resolved that question. My other remarks were intended to be vague and philosophical, because I really try to not let my personal opinions interfere with what I think is correct from a Wikipedia point of view.
[Debresser]: Basically, there shouldn't be any examples at all, IMHO.
[Debresser]: I myself would like to be an admin. Mainly for the sake of being able to edit protected templates once in while, or delete the odd speedy. I have closed Cfd and Tfd discussions upon occasion. But I have had some serious conflicts over the years with two editors, both Jewish, and in relation to Jewish subjects. Interesting, isn't it? So it is not likely that I would make admin. Even though I personally do not think myself unfit to be an admin because of these conflicts.
[Debresser]: This is a long and serious post. I'll read it Sunday. I just spent a whole day touring Jerusalem with a group from Russia. Shabbat I am with them also.
[Debresser]: Unfortunately, I didn't have Internet access these days. For which reason I gave my cellular number. It is mind-boggling that we actually stayed in the same hotel for three days, and didn't meet. I was there as the rabbi, accompanying a group of 40 youngsters from Russia on a tour of Israel.
[Debresser]: I live in Jerusalem. If you took the tour, or are staying along on your own, we could still meet.
[Debresser]: Answered on user talkpage. Although this might be a registered user editing without logging in.
[Debresser]: Why did you put a link to the editnotice template {{Tl|Editnotice Date format Mmmm d, yyyy}} in the documentation of {{Tl|Use mdy dates}}? These templates have nothing in common, and are being used in completely different situations with completely different results. I don't think that the fact that both have to do with the format mdy is enough of a reason to have it there."

Daveswagon,False,"[Daveswagon]: Elkman, since I saw you did the [[Bridge of Hope]] page, I was wondering if you could confirm for me which brige the [[County Road 78 Bridge]] is. Is it the main concrete girder bridge in Sartell? The [[List of crossings of the Upper Mississippi River]] says it's south of Sartell, but there are actually two bridges in Sartell, the girder one and an older, trussed one that is no longer used. If you could clear this up for me, I can photograph the bridges and then start working on their articles. Thanks.--
[Daveswagon]: [[User:Dual Freq|Dual Freq]] answered my question, but if you're able to fill in the info boxes on those two pages (now [[Sartell Bridge]] and [[Old Sartell Bridge]]), that would be appreciated.--
[Daveswagon]: Thanks for filling in those bridge info boxes. Yes, I'm always willing to help on Central Minnesota topics, however, I'll be going overseas to study in a few weeks so my contributions for the next several months will be few and far between.--

[Daveswagon]: I took the pictures myself and some of the other shots clearly show only two piers in the water. I've changed the article to reflect this. BTW, I also added an image of the [[New Sauk Rapids Bridge]]. If you can identify a bridge type from its picture, it'd be great if you could add that to its info box. Thanks.--
[Daveswagon]: I changed the number of spans on the [[Sauk Rapids Bridge]] from four to three in line with the disappearance of our \""mystery pier\"". I hope this was correct.--

[SynergeticMaggot]: Good god. I actually correct that mistake on AfD all the time! <shakes head around> This is going to make me switch from copying and pasting the tag and just do it with the subst:rfa's. Thanks again. :)
[SynergeticMaggot]: Hello Qaddosh. Your RfA, although still fresh, might not be going the way you might have thought it would. I'm here to suggest you withdraw it. If you do this, and notify me on my talk page, I can close it. But it is ''extremely'' likely to be closed per [[WP:SNOW|snow]], like so many have done so before. ''Best regards''.
[SynergeticMaggot]: Not a problem, just let me know if you are willing to withdraw (unless you'd like someone else to do it, then you would just <strike>strike out<\/strike> your acceptance and specify that you'd like to withdraw on your RfA). The only reason I dropped this message off is to help avoid a prolonged,pile-on of oppose votes. Mine ended in a similar fashion, and when I see an RfA that isn't going so well, I'll ask the nominee if someone hasn't already. You appear to be a great contributor and I hope this doesn't prevent you from further editing the pedia. :) Remember, we are volunteers!
[SynergeticMaggot]: Again, no problem at all. But I didn't close it per [[WP:SNOW|snow]], but as withdrawn (withdrawing looks better in my opinion). You've made the right decision in my opinon. Take all the time you need. Hopefully you come back feeling refreshed and ready to work\/edit. :)
[SynergeticMaggot]: By the way. The moral supports are there as to not make it appear that oppose votes are there to attack the candidate. Also I'd like to inform you that its not recommended that you make comments inside a closed discussion. ''Best regards''.

[SynergeticMaggot]: Thats not what I said. I said that the topic of ''gray magic'' is unlikely to be discussed amongst serious occultists. This excludes any type of Wicca or Paganism since occultism and neo-crafts do not go hand in hand. True occultism predates anything created out of thin air in this century (and the last).

DJ Clayworth,True,"[DJ Clayworth]: Hi. I notice you have just [[:Category:Skanska]]. Does a company really deserve its own category? Even the article only has a few paragraphs.
[DJ Clayworth]: Your 'proposal' that Wikipedia allow sexual depiction of minors if obviously impractical, since doing so will allow Wikipedia to be prosecuted in the US and closed down. Please think a little.
[DJ Clayworth]: Your article [[Percy Nobby Norton]] reads like a joke. On the tiny chance that you are writing about an actual person, please supply references for what you write. If it's a joke, which seems more likely, please stop now. Some things are funny only once.
[DJ Clayworth]: The easiest way to respond is to say to yourself \""that was fun we had a good time making this up\"", and stop editing. If you are lucky this article will make it to [[Wikipedia:Bad Jokes and Other Deleted Nonsense]]. Incidentally, if you wish to keep editing here, please sign your contributions to talk pages by putting four tildes at the end like this <nowiki>~~~~<\/nowiki>
[DJ Clayworth]: That's what I thought. Sorry to bother you. For future reference, when move vandalism like this occurs it's usually better to just let an Admin know so they can move the whole article back.
[DJ Clayworth]: Thank you for your contributions to Wikipedia. I notice you have been editing [[Christianity]], and article which is highly controvesial. Some of your edits seem to be major changes to the introduction, a text which was arrived at through a complicated consensus process. Can I suggest that you discuss your proposed changes with other editors before making them, using [[Talk:Christianity]]. That way we can prevent dissention and edit warring. Thank you.
[DJ Clayworth]: Hi. Thanks for your contributions to this article, but the actual meaning of the words in use are under debate on the talk page of that article. Please don't just wade in and apply your interpretation. It's very unlikely that Joseph Smith meant the 'common' interpretation of the word 'professors' (i.e. senior lecturers at a university) so he must have meant something different. The discussion is whether he meant \""those who profess\"", (i.e. everyone who adheres to the religion,  a much more common meaning than used now) or merely all the leaders. The only evidence we have is an LDS reference to a Bible verse that implies he meant everyone.
[DJ Clayworth]: What's your logic, please, for saying that \""bobby on the beat\"" is a nickname for policemen?
[DJ Clayworth]: Thank you. I agree with you entirely. I think we need to explain that \""bobby on the beat\"" refers only to policemen that are patrolling, as another editor seems to think that the nickname applies to all officers whatever they are doing.  But given that \""bobby on the beat\"" is a) restricted pretty much to the UK and b) restricted to those that are doing a specific thing I wonder if it belongs in the lead about police officers worldwide?
[DJ Clayworth]: I have plenty of references that indicate that it is used to mean ''patrolling'' police officers. If you look around you will find plenty of references saying things like \""the bobby on the beat has vanished in our time\"". That doesn't mean the policeman has vanished, it simply means that the foot-patrolling policeman has vanished. Why do you think it is used to refer to those who are not on patrol?
[DJ Clayworth]: Do you mean it is 'self-explanatory' that it only refers to policemen on patrol? I don't think so. Those not used to English slang will find it confusing - like I said there is at least one other editor who seems to think that the term refers to all policemen, whether or not they are on patrol.
[DJ Clayworth]: I'm glad that you think my question was self-explanatory, but I would really like you to answer it. I have read your second reply with all the detail required, but it doesn't answer my point.
[DJ Clayworth]: It may as well be a redirect. As a redirect it's doing no harm. I'll make Amen point to '''[[Berakhah]]'''.
[DJ Clayworth]: You're welcome. It's easy to get sucked into something like that.
[DJ Clayworth]: No problem. I made that mistake myself at first.
[DJ Clayworth]: You're welcome. The pleasure is equally mine.
[DJ Clayworth]: We would be grateful if you would discuss wholesale removals of well-referenced sections from articles before doing so, please. That article is in the middle of a rewrite, and being actively discussed.

[DJ Clayworth]: No problem. Fixed it. It happens to us all.
[DJ Clayworth]: Reply at [[User talk:Mysteryboy123]].
[DJ Clayworth]: Sorry, a mistake in the editing process there. (And I didn't call anyone 'homosexual', I undid that change). Thanks for fixing.
[DJ Clayworth]: Dude, it was a copyright infringement. Copyright infringements should be deleted if at all possible to remove them from the edit history. I would have no objection if you were to create a stub. Note however that the article name should have \""Washington DC\"" rather than \""the nation's capital\"" in the title, to pacify those pesky people who live in other nations.
[DJ Clayworth]: Internet memes don't always make good articles. In any case, if this is a tool for assisting with Wikipedia editing it belongs in Wikipedia space, not the article space. I would suggest discussion before creating it anyway.
[DJ Clayworth]: The subject of your page got precisely two Google hits. Please don't waste our time.
[DJ Clayworth]: I disagree with your reading of the naming convention. Full reply at [[User talk:Readin]].
[DJ Clayworth]: Sounds good.
[DJ Clayworth]: Actually I removed what appeared to be vandalism back to a version before the article was made main. Sorry if I took more stuff away than was necessary.
[DJ Clayworth]: I dislike salting. If for some reason this journal of his ever becomes genuinely noteworthy someone will wonder why we did it. However if it's created again I will absolutely salt it, as well as blocking the creator in perpetuity. It's not like an article titled in all-caps is going to get past the RC patrol. Let me know if you see it again.
[DJ Clayworth]: Cute is only funny once, but an encyclopedia article is forever.
[DJ Clayworth]: It's been a day since he\/she edited the article, so I would say leave it for now. He\/she has probably gone away. If it starts again let me know, and I'll put a temporary block on the IP.
[DJ Clayworth]: Had a look at the talk page, and I think the thing here is not to feed the trolls. Arguing is only going to make matters worse.
[DJ Clayworth]: A link for the debate would suffice.
[DJ Clayworth]: If there wasn't a formal decision to delete then let's leave it. We'll put a stop to fruitless argument and then the page can stand as a record of what was said.
[DJ Clayworth]: Let someone else deal with it if they want.
[DJ Clayworth]: Yes, I''ve undone this and I will find out if there is an explanation.
[DJ Clayworth]: The whole debate, including the part you posted, was clearly going nowhere. Please let sleeping dogs lie. Wikipedia is not an investigative journalist, hoping to uncover hidden facts. We report what is written.
[DJ Clayworth]: The discussion was futile, and irrelevant to improving the article. You attempted to restart it. Please don't.
[DJ Clayworth]: It is futile because it in no way contributes to the improving of Wikipedia. The whole \""where was he born\"" debate is clearly settled in the minds of 99% of people, and debating the merits of the issue is not Wikipedia's business.
[DJ Clayworth]: You can look up the sources as well as I can. Please stop this now. I have better things to be doing.
[DJ Clayworth]: Let me be clear about this. Wikipedia is '''not''' here to debate the truth of Barack Obama's birth location. The fact that you don't consider the case proved is irrelevant. For the overwhelming majority of people the cases is closed and that is what Wikipedia reports. Your posting was a clear attempt to '''reopen the debate about Obama's birth''', and that is not the purpose of Wikipedia. That and anything else not related to improving the article will be removed.
[DJ Clayworth]: It is completely clear that consensus opinion in the world is that Obama was born where he said he was. 100 million people voted for him. Your 'petition' could be one guy with an internet bot (or one guy with no qualms about lying to make his point). '''Please do not make further posts on this page'''.

[DJ Clayworth]: He's been told the facts, he's been warned. If he edits the article again today he'll be blocked. If the keeps editing the article after that we'll maybe give him a reference to the OED and if that doesn't work we'll assume he's a vandal.
[DJ Clayworth]: Reply at [[User talk: Arpitdubey]].
[DJ Clayworth]: Actually the image is '''not''' being used under a fair use claim. It's being used with the permission of the copyright owner.
[DJ Clayworth]: If you read the policy, you will find that it is English language Wikipedia practice to use either American or non-American English spelling and usage. Specifically on articles focussed on Britain (such as [[Murder of James Bulger]]) British spelling is preferred.
[DJ Clayworth]: Done.
[DJ Clayworth]: Reply at [[User talk:Endymian]].
[DJ Clayworth]: That would be [[User:Wikiwiki1228]].

[DJ Clayworth]: Not sure grammaticism is always the best response, but since he went on about 'ignorance' I couldn't resist.
[DJ Clayworth]: I'll have a word.
[DJ Clayworth]: Reply at [[User talk:Stilltim]].
[DJ Clayworth]: If you read what I wrote, I said \""sorry I was wrong\"". The prohibition only applies to biographical articles.
[DJ Clayworth]: Having said all that I have no particular objection to the OT quotes going back.
[DJ Clayworth]: As I explained, such lists grow indefinitely. You want Spurs included: someone else thinks Newcastle should be in; if Newcastle are in then Ipswich should be in, then Cambridge United and so on until the list is hundreds long. Actually I've now taken the whole list out. Every major club is already mentioned in the section.
[DJ Clayworth]: No problem. Another 999,900 albums sold and you'll definitely deserve a Wikipedia article!
[DJ Clayworth]: I'll look at this edits again, but it won't be for a few hours.
[DJ Clayworth]: Yes, I spotted it on the request page for Admin intervention. I was surprised because I assumed it was about the Treasure island character, and I thought it an odd target for vandalism. I would suggest not putting it on long-term protection if we can avoid it. Frankly I think the main reason it's being vandalised is because Mr Hawkins keeps talking about it. If he stopped, it would probably die away. Anyway, I'm going to keep it on my watch list, which I gather other people are too. Most vandals go away when they find that their edits never actually show up on the page.
[DJ Clayworth]: Sorry, I have no idea. Try Google.
[DJ Clayworth]: Sure. However don't move a long-standing article about a well-known concept to insert an article about a recently-created Facebook app.
[DJ Clayworth]: Firstly you should not insert external links in the main body of the article, which you did. Secondly, you should not be promoting anything you are personally associated with, which it seems you are, even by providing links to it.
[DJ Clayworth]: You are not allowed to promote anything, whether it is for sale or not. There are very strict limits on what can be linked in the external links. I don't believe your links count. If you wish you may discuss this on the talk page of the article. However I would say that Wikipedians generally dislike external links unless extremely relevant.
[DJ Clayworth]: I'll look at that.
[DJ Clayworth]: Thanks for your input. I'm sure the article will survive the deletion nomination then.
[DJ Clayworth]: I didn't say \""historical events\"" I said \""spiritual events\"" and I quote from [[WP:MOS]]: \""Spiritual or religious events are likewise capitalized only when they are terms referring to specific incidents or periods (the Great Flood)\"".
[DJ Clayworth]: I suggest reading what I wrote at on the deletion nomination.
[DJ Clayworth]: Done.
[DJ Clayworth]: I'm not sure what that's about. The MOS doesn't distinguish between 'past' and 'future' events like this: it just refers to \""spiritual events\"".
[DJ Clayworth]: If you think the policy should be changed, the place to suggest it is on the talk page of the relevant policy.
[DJ Clayworth]: You're welcome.
[DJ Clayworth]: OK, I'll give it a little more time. Make sure you have read [[Wikipedia:Notability]].
[DJ Clayworth]: Am I right in thinking that you are the grandson of the subject? If so then please make sure you read [[Wikipedia:Conflict of interest]]. You should not be writing about people you are related to. I've also noticed that every reference which refers to Van Haren as Hispanic is either written by you or a direct quote from you. The list of Hispanic war aces which you cite does not mention him either- is this perhaps because he did not think of himself as Hispanic?
[DJ Clayworth]: There is no need to start deleting things from history. That's a complicated process requiring higher level privileges than admin, and generally only done for legal reasons. Some spam buried in an articles history won't help the spammer.
[DJ Clayworth]: OK. No problem.
[DJ Clayworth]: I know it's meant to be. I'm doubtful that it's a noteworthy enough saying to deserve an article on its own. It's also named wrong - it shouldn't have double quotes in the title.
[DJ Clayworth]: OK.

[DJ Clayworth]: Reply at [[User talk:Neutrality]].
[DJ Clayworth]: And the point of your doing this would be?
[DJ Clayworth]: As for you other point, in a contentious Wikipedia article, there is no such thing as a 'stable solution'. Every solution, no matter how balanced, will be questioned and probably attacked by someone. And the definition of 'contentious article' is \""any article edited by more than one person\"".
[DJ Clayworth]: No, I'm afraid their aren't. In most cases those identified as ''Irish'' were either associated with the ROI when it was created, or were early enough ([[Oscar Wilde]]) that it was never an issue. However the truth is that Wikipedia is schizophrenic to the point of hipocracy on these matters. It really depends on who is editing the article.
[DJ Clayworth]: There was no reference in the paragraph you added. And please sign your posts on talk pages. You have been told that at least four times.
[DJ Clayworth]: I know, it can be a balancing act, and not everyone thinks the same, so you can't please everyone all the time. Don't worry, you are doing a good job.
[DJ Clayworth]: It's amazing how effective writing in all caps is. I intend to do it all the time from now on. <nowiki><\/sarcasm><\/nowiki>.
[DJ Clayworth]: The worst I could do is redelete it, but since it's now an AFD candidate that's not permitted. We'll let the AFD run it's course. Maybe there is something to it after all.
[DJ Clayworth]: This is best discussed at [[Talk:Murder of James Bulger]].
[DJ Clayworth]: I don't think Apathy is applicable; otherwise do whatever you feel like.
[DJ Clayworth]: OK, I'll accept that.
[DJ Clayworth]: Please make sure you have read [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view]] thoroughly. Writing such a promotional article as your very first contribution to Wikipedia indicates that you may be connected with the product. If this is the case a [[Wikipedia:Conflict of interest]] arises, and you should refrain from writing about the product at all. At the very least, if you came to Wikipedia specifically to write about this product, then please don't. At least get the feel for Wikipedia by editing some other unrelated articles first.
[DJ Clayworth]: Your article was barely coherent, completely unreferenced, and contained many highly unlikely claims. Saint Pituas gets no reliable Google hits. If you honestly believe that what you wrote about Saint Pituas was real, please post a link to a reliable source supporting this. Otherwise please don't waste our time.
[DJ Clayworth]: No problem. You're not being accused of anything, I'm just letting you know why the lyrics were removed.
[DJ Clayworth]: I've suggested that the author puts it back in the mainspace as soon as possible. It needs work, true, but there are many worse articles and the sooner it's in the main space the more people can collaborate on improving it.
[DJ Clayworth]: I've copied this, and replied, at [[Talk:Christianity]].
[DJ Clayworth]: OK, it looks as if the signature isn't having the desired effect. Policy says that your signature should include a link to your userpage, which yours doesn't. That's why [[User:SineBot]] flags your edits as unsigned. Signatures which don't include your real username as a link are misleading for readers. Please have a look at the questions on [[User talk:SineBot]].

[DJ Clayworth]: Hi, [[User:DESiegel|DES]]. Do you have a suggestion as to how these article make Wikipedia better?
[DJ Clayworth]: That's a valid view. What I suggest you do is try to establish a consensus as to whether this is acceptable. [[Wikipedia talk:Speedy deletion]] may be appropriate, or possibly [[Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)]]. I'll agree to hold off deletions for a few days if you like while that happens.
[DJ Clayworth]: If you write something, I'll contribute also and we'll see what people say.
[DJ Clayworth]: I wrote something anyway, at [[Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)#Redirects with trailing commas]]. Please feel free to contribute.
[DJ Clayworth]: Agreed.
[DJ Clayworth]: No problem. I'll do it right now.
[DJ Clayworth]: Please take this to [[Talk:Polygamy in Christianity]].
[DJ Clayworth]: No. Quite the reverse in fact. We make a point of '''not''' protecting the main article so as to emphasize the fact that Wikipedia is open to everybody. In fact if I had realized it I would not have even semiprotected it. I'm going to undo it now.
[DJ Clayworth]: I see. In that case \""yes\"", and I've just unprotected it. There was a bout of vandalism on it earlier, and while I've range-blocked the perpetrator he might find a way back. Watching would be good.
[DJ Clayworth]: This is true. However after you created the article it was extensively edited by [[User:Matthewsmkting]]. Your version also included some statements that are not appropriate for an encyclopedia. If you like I can restore your version for you to continue working on.

[Salix alba]: Hi Mattisse, I would suggest not responding to Hypocrite here, or indeed anywhere. Problem also a good idea to hold your tounge on all matters relating to Giano. --
[Salix alba]: Just because you have a block does not mean that we do not appreciate your work on wikipedia, its just that we need to prevent another incident exploding, and the only way that seems to be achievable is with a short block. Hopefully being a bit calmer in a day will help. --

[Salix alba]: Is there any details of this? I've looked in a few places and could not see reference. What was the puppet account? --
[Salix alba]: It seems that {{user|Charles Rodriguez}} is a sock. Oh dear Mattisse I would have hopped you would have learnt by now that sockpuppets is not the way to go.--
[Salix alba]: If Mattisse is to be unblocked, I would recommend returning to [[User:Mattisse\/Plan]] or the arbitration case and adding an explicit section about sock-puppets. Something along the line of ''any further use of sock-puppets will result in a permanent ban from wikipedia''. Mattisse seems to need very strict boundaries with clearly spelt out consequences.--
[Salix alba]: The question is how long the block should be for and whether the block should become a permant ban. I guess this will be a question for Arbcom rather than here. When considering a ban the good does need to be weighted against the bad as she has consistently made voluminous good edits, we would loose these with a ban. With Mattisse it has always been a case of damage limitation, and I think the mentoring system is getting better at reducing the damage caused.--

[Salix alba]: Sounds like it would be a case for page protection. To me it seems flagged revisions are best compared to page protection, kind of like protected pages where an anon can make a test edit. My fear would be that rather than converting protected pages to flagged revisions, it would be more likely be used to convert normal pages to flagged revision.--
[Salix alba]: Seems that this is another one with work still to do. You might like to join discussion on [[Template talk:Globalize]].--
[Salix alba]: I saw this as well. I've started a discussions at [[Template talk:Globalize]]. --
[Salix alba]: I've replied at [[Talk:Plimpton_322#Pythagorean_triple]].--
[Salix alba]: BTW you might like look a bit at [[Wikipedia:FAQ\/Editing]]. In you posts you are adding line breaks in the middle of paragraphs. Its convention to just let the lines run on so they wrap automatically. Also if you want to make a link to a page use <nowiki>[[Plimpton 322]]<\/nowiki> rather than pasting the full url. And finally please sign you posts on talk pages using <nowiki>--~~~~~<\/nowiki> (there is a button for this in the edit box) so we can keep trak of who wrote what.--

[Salix alba]: The second reference[http:\/\/www.jainworld.com\/JWHindi\/Books\/shatkhandagama-4\/02.htm] list a number of formula, the typography is terrible but we seem to have log(m\/n)=log(m)-log(n); log(x^2)=2 log(x); log(log x^2)=log(2 log(x))=log(2)+log(log(x))=1+log(log(x)) (logs are in base 2); if B=a^a then log(B)=a log(a), log(log(b))=log(a)+log(log(a)). And a few more which don't make a lot of sense.--
[Salix alba]: Possible, {{user| LawesMattius}} could also be her grandson, the edit seems a bit juvenile for her. If she is around she be keeping a very low profile.--
[Salix alba]: See [[Help:Magic words]] I don't think it possible to create new one unless you are a developer and have access to the code. You could try [[WP:VPT]].--
[Salix alba]: I've really not used the program much, just know a few people who have. You could try asking on their forum. The other software I've heardabout, but never used is [[Macaulay2]].--
[Salix alba]: Taking the first of these comparisons: [[Shamit Kachru]] is an award-winning physicist and an expert in string theory and quantum field theory,  he has made central contributions to the study of compactifications of string theory from ten to four dimensions, has won the ACIPA Outstanding Young Physicist Prize. This makes a claim to a notable achievements. There was no such claim on [[Mridu]] where the list of things done (making the site search engine friendly, creating webmaster accounts in various search engines, mainly Google, Yahoo, Bing; creating automated RSS feed (if applicable); planning of URL rewriting patterns creating search engine sitemaps (xml files); create Google Analytics account and helping the developer implement the code; create title & metadata of top level key-pages of the website including the home page.) These are what I would expect of any professional in the industry. There is nothing beyond that, say published articles or papers (not blogs) frequent references by new sources, major national awards.--
[Salix alba]: You can create a draft at [[User:Mridubhattacharya\/Mridu]] but please read [[Wikipedia:Notability (people)]] first.  The draft would not be immune from deletion if it was found that it did not meet the notability guidelines. Its worth looking at [[Wikipedia:Articles for creation]] which can help you get the article upto standard.--
[Salix alba]: My worry is the number of editors who would scrutinise your every movement. On WikiSource you don't have as much history so there are less people watching you. It would be a much more pressured environment for you. Can you remain calm in these circumstances? --
[Salix alba]: I think I've left pending changes on. Its just the block of new and unregistered users which I've remove. --
[Salix alba]: Yes done. Now all I need to do is find a font which renders them! --
[Salix alba]: Yep I had half a feeling it was an accidental thing.--
[Salix alba]: (after edit conflict) You could add {{tlp|bots|2=optout=all}} to suppress the placing of notification messages. See [[Template:Bots]] for all the options. It might not actually stop all the messages as they seem to be placed by individual editors rather than bots. Individual editors may not be aware of your block status, but other editors doing image work might not so will not know not to post on your page. --
[Salix alba]: Yes I would. There is a big case of [[WP:OWN]] here, I've considered doing the same myself, but had other things to do. --
[Salix alba]: Not sure who Smith is i got the information from [http:\/\/www.logic.univie.ac.at\/~thompson\/papers\/venn-review.pdf] but I've not read the original book. The formula in that paper is <math>sin(2^i x)\\over 2^i<\/math> which makes mathematical sense.--
[Salix alba]: Some of the higher dimensional polytopes are being discussed at [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Mathematics#Polytope articles]]. You might like to participate.--
[Salix alba]: Hi, Just to let you know that I've reopened the move discussion - [[Leibniz formula for pi#Requested move part 2]]. There was some discussion about it at [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Mathematics#FYI: Leibniz formula for pi]] it seems like the 7 day period had not elapsed and the was not a sufficiently overwhelming consensus for a non admin close.--
[Salix alba]: Re point 2 checking [[Special:UserRights\/Skomorokh]] you do not appear to have the admin bit set, which is what I looked at. Don't know why that is you might want to get a bureaucrat to have a look at it.--
[Salix alba]: The sit back an enjoy a nicer looking wikipedia.--
[Salix alba]: Maybe one day if enough people start using MathJax then the devs might switch it on for IP's. It still early days yet and building a critical mass of people to test it.--
[Salix alba]: Have had a look at {{user|BarkingMoon}} contributions notice how many of the edits are about bird and wildlife ([[Yellow-crowned Bishop]], [[White-winged Widowbird]], [[White-headed Buffalo Weaver]], etc) have you noticed that particular interest in Mattisses edits?--
[Salix alba]: Likewise I can can confirm a yes. She has expressed concern that users have been falsely identified as her socks {{user|Loopy48}} and {{user|74.97.209.127}} and has stated they are not her socks. There first of these is an arbcom block and a second is a suspect sockpuppet identified by Sandy on the basis of a single edit.[http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Piehole4&diff=prev&oldid=405072192] The first of these is above my pay grade, but I must say Sandy should really try for better evidence before throwing accusations about.--
[Salix alba]: Remind me what it was I did.--
[Salix alba]: You do want to give the article a [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (lead section)|Lead section]] of two or three short paragraphs. In the case of the West Hartlepool War Memorial a lot could be done to make it more concise.--
[Salix alba]: I've not commented on actual article as I'm still trying to understand the topic and the discussion. The Haskell code does indicate the algorithm simply but after reading the O\u2019Neill paper it seems that there is a lot of subtleties in how Haskell actually interprets and executes the codes. For this reason I'd be cautious about any Haskell code samples, and they would need to come from a published source. It might be simpler just not to include any Haskell code, but instead mention the Turner algorithm and the critique of it. It is not wikipedias job to be a code repository which is better handle buy external links.--
[Salix alba]: Yes I've seen the haskell.org page and run the examples. While it looks good, it can't be used a a wikipedia source as most of it is written by you so classes as [[WP:OR]]. Wikipedia is really for old established stuff rather than the latest algorithms. --
[Salix alba]: This might explain the cause of your problems. Most of the regulars on WikiProject mathematics will take quite a hard line on OR. There have been too many incidents of people with a particular agenda or pet theories. For an extreme example see the West Hartlepool post above. No OR is a particularly effective tool against this and it has been one of the things which has helped wikipedia achieve what it has.  Even when its a seemingly straight forward improvement when its not backed by a reliable source it doesn't go in.--
[Salix alba]: Hi, you recently closed [[Wikipedia:Redirects_for_discussion\/Log\/2011 July 25#equidistant|RFD equidistant]] as '''soft redirect to''' [[wikt:equidistant]]. Following a discussion on [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Mathematics#deletion of equidistant]] it seems that there is enough material for a non trivial stub article and I've composed a draft at [[Talk:Equidistant#Draft]]. If its OK with you I'd like to recreate the article.--"
Notyourbroom,False,"[Notyourbroom]: You recently commented on a [[http:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/Commons:Quality_images_candidates\/candidate_list#February_16.2C_2009|quality image candidate]] of mine and had something to say about capitalization in the filename. It has been my personal convention to name files with only an initial capital letter. I am still new to Commons, so if there is a different standard convention I ought to use, I would appreciate your pointing me in the correct direction to read about the issue. Thanks! --
[Notyourbroom]: &mdash;
[Notyourbroom]: Best, &mdash;
[Notyourbroom]: I apologize if I violated any policies, but I was under the impression that Racepacket had not been following the instructions on the [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=William_T._Miller&oldid=323173254 Possible Copyright Infringement] template, which specifically instructed us not to edit the main page but rather to put any revisions on the subpage. I thought Racepacket had misread the instructions and was making edits improperly to the original page instead of on the special-purpose subpage sandbox prescribed by the template. All that I did was revert to your original tagged version of the article and then move the revised prose onto the subpage, which, again, I thought was required in order to follow the process of clearing up the Possible Copyright Infringement. Please let me know what I misunderstood and did incorrectly here, because I do not want to mishandle similar situations in the future. &mdash;
[Notyourbroom]: In addition, I would propose modifying that template to give more explicit directions to clear up any such misunderstandings in the future (though I'm still unclear on what the misunderstanding was!). &mdash;
[Notyourbroom]: Dysmorodrepanis, please do not misuse the [[WP:MINOR|minor edit]] marker, as you did recently in [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wattled_Curassow&diff=prev&oldid=325563463 your edit] to [[Wattled Curassow]]. The formatting change you made has repercussions for users on devices with smaller screens (five columns may require them to scroll horizontally) and you also deleted content from the article, so this was clearly not a minor edit. Thank you. \u2014
[Notyourbroom]: Marking a revert as a minor edit is fine when dealing with vandalism (\""The intended use of the rollback feature is for cases of vandalism, where the act of reverting any vandalism should be considered minor and can be ignored in the recent changes list\""), but (1) this was not a revert of an unambiguously unproductive edit, (2) it was a \""long-distance\"" revert of changes made a few revisions past in the article's history, and (3) you removed content from the article, which in itself is an unambiguous case of a major edit. There is no grey area in this case\u2014you clearly made an error based on the consensus regarding the usage of the minor edit marker. I see from your edit history that you commonly employ that marker, so I am encouraging you to review the current community consensus so that you do not make similar errors in the future. \u2014
[Notyourbroom]: Welcome! Good to see some new blood- most of the active editors in the project don't actually live in Ithaca anymore, so we can be a bit constrained in what we do. If you're looking to make any photographic contributions, one thing I can think of off the top of my head is Bailey Plaza. I understand the plaza looks substantially different now compared to [[:File:Cornell Bailey Plaza March09.jpg|how it looked in Spring 2009]]. Also, there are a few new buildings on campus (like whatever that one is sandwiched between Rockefeller and Baker on the hill above the Arts Quad...) that we lack photography of. I understand you've made a lot of contributions in the area of music-related articles; some Cornell articles in that genre (like [[Cornell University Glee Club]]) are in pretty good shape, but others (like [[Cornell University Chorus]]) need extreme overhauls, and there's always room for more. You might be interested in expanding [[Bailey Hall (Ithaca, New York)]] to talk about some of the more famous premiers and concerts that that venue has seen over its long history. Of course, this is all just one guy's suggestions- focus on whatever you feel inspired to do. Cheers!&mdash;
[Notyourbroom]: Oh, no need for \""Mr.\""- I'm class of 2009 :). Just as a resource for you, I looked through my watchlist and pulled out [[User:Notyourbroom\/Cornellpages|a bunch of Cornell-related pages]], many of which aren't linked to by any navigation templates. You can paste any you want to follow into your own [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Special:Watchlist\/raw raw watchlist]. &mdash;
[Notyourbroom]: Hi there. I believe I've demonstrated on Commons that the file you expressed concerns about has no copyright status problems. If you are satisfied with that evidence, I would appreciate it if you could withdraw your support for deletion so that I can close the case as \""keep\"". (I can only do this if the result is wholly \""uncontroversial\"", hence this request.) If you are not satisfied, I would be happy to entertain further discussion. Thank you. &mdash;"
Blackjanedavey,False,"[Blackjanedavey]: Hiya. Just wondering why you reverted my edits for [[Rene Magritte]].
[Blackjanedavey]: It's not necessary to delete this article. Despite the fact that he hasn't yet played a game for Queensland Roar he has definately played senior team games for his previous clubs. And there's a very good chance he'll play a senior game for Roar when the season starts, which means all the work already done for his page will have to be redone. Besides, all players signed to an A-League club have their own page regardless of how many games they're played, due to the fact that because of the small playing roster of the A-League there's a very high chance they'll play at least one game in the upcoming season.
[Blackjanedavey]: Ok but what about the fact that he has '''definately''' played a senior game for his previous clubs (in a fully professional league)? Surely that means his page is valid. I just can't find the exact number of games because that information is not available on the internet."
Olpl,False,"[Olpl]: You will definitely like [http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/9\/9c\/Rembrandt_Harmensz._van_Rijn_125.jpg The return of the prodigal son, 35Mb file] too.

Ordinary Person,False,"[Ordinary Person]: Thank you for your comments, Nightscream. I will reflect on these matters. It seems to me that the previous version was misleading: it is true that the material was taken away before the forensic investigation was significantly underway, but it seems to imply that the removal of the material _prevented_ a thorough forensic investigation of the materials. I'll consider carefully and collect my thoughts (and refs) before making any more edits.
[Ordinary Person]: BTW, I'm never sure of the standard way to conduct a conversation via User Talk pages. Should I reply to your comments on my own page, or post the rejoinder on yours? The former is more conventional because then the whole conversation is in one place, but on the other hand I then suspect that my interlocutor will not be informed that I've replied."

Tphinney,False,"[Tphinney]: You have been going through and replacing \""typographer\"" with \""type designer\"" on several pages. Please stop doing this. They are not synonyms, and in the two instances I noticed, the edit was definitely inappropriate. (Robert Bringhurst, Apple Advanced Typography).
[Tphinney]: 
[Tphinney]: I disagree that \""nothing in it supports the assertion....\"" Specifically, there's this bit: \""As DH points out, Monotype's analogues did have clear associations with designs that predated the ITC ones. Of course, they were also clearly modified to reflect the ITC ones - matching not only metrics but also weights, heights, and design features (many, but not all, of the latter).\"" Now, note that \""metrics\"" is font-speak for widths, and sometimes heights. Yes, this references ITC because the immediate topic was the ITC lawsuit, but the same changes were made to all of the families in question.... Sigh. I could of course email any number of people involved and get a direct confirmation, but that would be \""original research\"" just to confirm something that literally everyone in this industry knows, and is not controversial. Not to mention the simple points of logic and temporal sequence I outlined above. Moreover, '''the article already said in another place that Arial is \""identical in width\"" to Helvetica'''; Monotype Grotesque is quite self-evidently not, so clearly some time between it being Monotype Grotesque and becoming Arial, its widths were made identical to Helvetica. I'm putting that back in."
Midgley,False,"[Midgley]: I'm interested in the phenomenom, rather than the people, particualrly in the way that copied information spreads, despite later corrections, across websites.  Also in the sociological view of the whole thing.
[Midgley]: [[Edward_Jenner]] in order to be a good article it needs references - I've not yet come to grips with handling refence within WP, there are some inline ones, but I wonder if you would offer advice or a demonstration, please?  I think it owuld be nice if the article was at least a GA at 14th May whcih is the anniversary.  By all means point me at something to read
[Midgley]: It will be interesting (but not very) to see what the [[anti-vaccinationist]]s say about that.
[Midgley]: Just a bit - we are in an asthma one and ramping up for a hypertension one that I can't yet talk about. I first read James Gleick's book \""Chaos\"" C17 years ago having bought it in Dulles airport and while travelling South backward at 500 mph, and some of the attractors are indeed strange.  Leifern has been away for a while, and returned in foul form - really obnoxious to the extent that something should be done.  Coincidentally whaleto popped back up at the same time, I guessed he had been having a lie down.
[Midgley]: At [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion\/Peter_Fletcher&curid=4306347&diff=43639707&oldid=43528004] you noted that Leifern had only turned up to be unpleasant.  He had also been staggeringly unpleasant in a wide range of other articles and edits.  Looking way back, the initial contact we had was him attacking me, but I see he deleted some edits of mine shortly before I relaised he existed.  Looking further back, one of the bees in his bonnet is anti-vaccinationists.  He will not have it that any such people exist, despite him explicitly making common cause with at least one in his mission to \""fully inform\"" people who might accept a vaccination, anyone who disagrees is a bad person, and he was very forceful in dismissing the use of the (actually moderately common) term in an [[autism]] article (another bee).  I think his recent editing conduct has been egregious in personal attacks on me, and I feel it is sufficiently so that admin attention ought to be focussed upon it.  Would you please take note of it to a greater extent than just marking it in that closing note - apart from it upsetting me, it is not advnacing WP.
[Midgley]: and [[Wikipedia:Miscellany_for_deletion\/User:Leifern\/Accusations_by_Midgley#.5B.5BUser:Leifern.2FAccusations_by_Midgley.5D.5D]]
[Midgley]: May I solicit your assistance on that page which still contins the Kennedy\/China quote as a reference?  I could copy your work form the autism epidemic talk page but it is your work and I don't want to write everything in the other article.  One simple use of the (Incidence) article would be to drop it straight into the space left after removing the whole text of the (Epidemic) article, renaming and so on to bring the edit histories together.  Anotehr would be to nuke the old article from orbit, of course.  It matters rather less than leaving a useful article to WP standard behind.
[Midgley]: 
[Midgley]: THe pyramidal tracts carry motor signals into the spinal cord and thence to the muscles.  (Roughly).  They are fairly plain wiring.  There are various systems that work on _position_ rather than power, and allow you to eg specify the position your hand should be in, that being different to where it currently is, movement occurs until it is there.  (Very roughly).  SO things affecting movement that are not due to a problem with the pyramidal tracts are extra-pyramidal effects and are common with anti=psychotic drugs of the Chlorpromazine --> Olanzapine sort of axes.  (Very very roughly).  Parkinson's disease, whcih is related to Dopaminergic nerves, produces effects that are not completely unlike  some of these.  Anti=psychotic drugs as above have efects on dompaminergic neurones.  I may have to write an artile on this now, if there really isn't one, here or more likely on http:\/\/ganfyd.\/org but I'd need to do some reading _first_.  Tardive duskinesia is a late (late = tardy - tardive) and unexpected effect, extra-pyramidal effects are prompt and expected and reversible.
[Midgley]: Science is science and many other things are perfectly reasonable other things.  Pseudoscience I take to be wrapping non-science in the trappings of science in order to confuse.  [[Orgonite]], [[[Royal Rife]] and - given the assertion of subluxations - [[chiropractic]]'s fundemanetal theoretical basis are pseudoscience.  Science is powerful and pseudoscience is an attempt to steal that power for fraudulent purposes.
[Midgley]: As a secondary activity, I note there is an RFC on [[WP:RS]] one idea in which is to list certain sources that are reputable, and by implication at least, certain sources that are not reputable.  It may be reasonable to write an essay which would have the same standing as eg [[WP:CB]] or [[WP:SNOW]] saying in essence WP does not link to Whale.to or its clones as a source becuase it has been determined by RFC that it is not reputable as a source.
[Midgley]: Thanks.

[Midgley]: Mutter.  OK.  Mumble.  Thanks.
[Midgley]: Mmmh.  That's a bit radical.  (I think US: Liberal is only a little to the right of our conservatives, isn't it?)  There is something in that.  Are you sure you are not going to get into the mediation thing - although maybe not there to start with?  I saw US television a couple of times*... I think that the nuts and bolts of the immune system are slowly being teased into piles, and we are likely to come up with some sort of fixes.  I rather like telling my (Type 1) Diabetics that if they stick with it, there is likely to be a cure for them ... I suppose we have to either get very radical with dissemination and sharing of knowledge, or put up with some of the Pharma foibles.  I think social anx. dis is what we used to call shy, and needed drawing out and not teasing - over here telling people they work that way and it is all right and tablets will not improve their life still works, often, so the rearguard is still in place.  (*CNN has its moments though)
[Midgley]: So when the question in the reader's mind is \""why didn't the UK adopt a single Mumps vaccine?\"", as it has been from time to time because of that row, WP now answers it.  The England & Wales dept. of Health never did answer it, as far as I know, so WP is a more useful resource on that single point than the government information service.  So that is why I dug into that.  It isn't perfect, of course, and we can shape it better.  (I think the section above would be easier to read if I'd allowed myself the use of \""monovalent\"".
[Midgley]: Tradenames... Most UK doctors prefer to use the drug name (eg \""Live Mumps vaccine - Jerryl Lynn strain\"" or \""Lercanidipine\"" to the trade names (Mumpsvax and Zanidip).  Is there a convention on WP yet?
[Midgley]: Interesting idea.  Is open source the same as open information\/digital commons though?
[Midgley]: In the [[solar tracker]] article, is polar mount correct?  It might be improved by a bit more detail about how it works, perhaps?
[Midgley]: Greatly.  Now I understand it.
[Midgley]: The problem is the tendency for every article to end up being about the same thing...
[Midgley]: Relevant, would be...
[Midgley]: A bit colorectal surgical for me, IE outside my area of expertise in particular techniques.  It isn't rubbish, I would tend to assume it is correct.  In the 20 years, or thirty anyway, staple guns have made quite a difference to how low an anastomosis you can do.
[Midgley]: I'm very happy for that to happen, I may have to learn how to do it before it happens if it is left to me.  Anyone?

[Reywas92]: Arkansas' is not grammatically correct.  1) An apostrophe has no pronunciation, so \""Arkansas' districts\"" is pronounced the same as \""Arkansaw districts.\"" (Arkansaw to reflect the odd pronunciation of the name). That is wrong. To be pronounced \""Arkansaw's districts\"" there ''must'' be an additional ''s''.  There is no difference what letter the noun ends with.  Follow the very simple rule of possessives: when making any singular noun possessive, add an apostrophe-s; when  making a plural noun that already end in ''s'' possessive, simply add an apostrophe.  For irregular plurals that do not end in ''s'', add an apostrophe-s.  These are singular nouns and should always add an apostrophe-s.  It is better to write Mr. Jones's (Joneses) rather than Mr. Jones' (Jones); the latter is still accepted because it phonetically makes sense as the ''s'' in the word is already pronounced, unlike Arkansas, but the the former is better because it is more clear. 2) The ''only'' times that you may leave off the ''s'' are for Biblical or Classical names such as Jesus' and Moses'. The only  exceptions are historical, which I disagree with but is generally accepted. 3) To be correctly consistent with with other articles.  We have [[Texas's 1st congressional district]] and [[Kansas's congressional districts]], which both need the additional ''s'' because the final ''s'' is pronounced differently, and because of the rule of possessives. 5) Per [[WP:MOS]], please do not change widely accepted, pre-set styles without a reason. 6) Per [[WP:MOS]], including the extra ''s'' is correct.  In short, they are correct with the additional ''s'', although they are often incorrectly accepted without it, and there is no need to move an established name.  Thanks for understanding and happy editing,  <font color=\""#1EC112\"" size=\""3px\"">
[Reywas92]: Massachusetts's is correct, but because the ''s'' is pronounced, unlike Texas and the others, Massachusetts' is considered acceptable.  Thanks,  <font color=\""#1EC112\"" size=\""3px\"">

[Reywas92]: It is in no way consistent to only list the name used ''colloquially'' for only some Indiana schools while there are thousands more schools that don't use the native names parameter incorrectly. At the very least they would definitely need to be swapped; the official school name (i.e. the article title, in this case Benjamin Bosse High School) should be listed in the name parameter, and the name using the city (Evansville Bosse) should go under native name.

[Reywas92]: I know what you are tyring to do; you don't have to show me; that's just ''not'' how you do it! You do not manually add this span to only Indiana articles.

Johnpacklambert,False,"[Johnpacklambert]: On another note, if you want to add someone to a category, remember it is good to mention in the article that they belong in that category first.  I think you have done fairly good on this, but that is what this discussion section made me think of.  Even if there are links to sources that clearly prove they belong in the category unless it states in the article \""Smith is a Latter-day Saint\"", \""Jones attended Yale\"" or \""Philips is a Republican\"" people are likely to complain about it.
[Johnpacklambert]: Well, keep up the work of creating articles in wikipedia.  If you need help in preserving an article ask me, and I will try and see what I can do to prevent deletions.  I have occasionally managed to dig up more sources or find language in wikipedia's notability guidelines to save articles, but after having seen the article on the current editor of the ''[[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]]'' and an article on a one-time majority leader of the Arizona State Senate deleted, I am beganing to realize that even people who tell you to go read the notability guidelines to see why your article was deleted often have no clue what these guidelines actually are.
[Johnpacklambert]: I was going to create an article on her, especially since she was listed as one of the geniuses of Joseph Smith documents along with [[Dean Jessee]] and [[Ron Esplin]] by [[Robin Jensen]] as quoted in the [[Mormon Times]].  However, since Best spent the last 35 years working in the Church archives, and is an expert on documents it is looking like it will be hard to find enough info on her to create an article, especially since people are going to say that The Mormon Times being part of the Deseret News, which is owned by the LDS Church, which employees her, creates a situation that some will claim lacks \""intellectual independence\"".  I am trying to make sure I find all leads before creating the article, so if you have any advice on sources I would appreciate it.  Thank you for your help.
[Johnpacklambert]: I would just like to thank you for all the work you have done to expand the article on Dr. Law.  It has been greatly inproved through your work.
[Johnpacklambert]: Authorship matters, and when the person is an open supporter of \""any means neccesary\"" to obtain goals, and has openly admited this fact, it needs to be pointed out so that the proper intent of the commentor can be understood.  Why am I the one attacked, when I am not the one advocating the breaking of laws and rules to obtain goals?[[User:Johnpacklambert|John Pack Lambert]] ([[User talk:Johnpacklambert#top|talk]]) 19:57, 31 March 2010 (UTC)  Secondly, my initial comments were on content, but other commentors engaged in attacks saying things like \""your opinion does not matter\"".  It was not opinion, it was statement of facts, and it was unneccessarily combative, especially since the person could not actually provide any reliable source for the alleged connections, and instead just went on an attack against me.  The motives of authors matter, there are no neutral and uninterested parties, and until you have read the works of [[Louis Midgley]] do not even try to claim you understand otherwise.  I was the one trying to maintain order and neutrality and I get attacked.  I am not the one who openly admits to favoring the breaking of rules to obtain what I have idependently determined to be \""the higher good\"".  If people have issues with their positions being made public, than do not publish them on the user page for all the world to see.  If I had tried to make conclusions based on past edits by the person, that might be questionable, but when they openly proclaim that they favor breaking rules under the rubric of \""by any means neccessary\"" this is something that must be considered in evaluating the validity of their edits.
[Johnpacklambert]: In Barraud's case it was the clearly indicated in the source list.  Beyond this, just because someone converts at a young age does not mean their parents are also converting.  The best example of why this is a false assumption is [[Vicki Matsumori]].  She is a convert to Mormonism but her parents are not.
[Johnpacklambert]: The other people are clearly notable members of the Tongan Royal Family.  I do not pretend to have either the understnading of Tongan culture or the time to create these articles, but I really think someone should.  Even the most basic reading of articles on Tonga's royal family will lead to references to Fusipali that do not refer to the initial one that I created the article on.  We need the disambiguation page so us main-landers have a chance of not being totally confused.
[Johnpacklambert]: Well, technically these are not the same category.  You may be right that the rationale for deleting one would preclude the other from exisiting, but they are not technically the same.  This among other things means that there was no notice that iti had been deleted, because in fact it had not.  However, you have no created about 23 articles that have dead-end categories.  That is a problem that I am tempted to say you should feel obliged to fix.
[Johnpacklambert]: I guess I should have said non-existant categories
[Johnpacklambert]: Not particularly, unless you want to.
[Johnpacklambert]: My revisions are in qisdom and order.  The talk page is controlled by biased people and I see no reason why I should seek approval from biased people to remove their bias.
[Johnpacklambert]: Why then can Foxe unilaterally act against my revisions over and over and over again?  He has removed other edits as well and has been essentially trying to unilaterally control the article.  I was not the first person to post attempts to point out the problems with the Perusite claims.  It is just that I used sources, but the earlier person merely wrote on the internal problems without having sought out sources.  It is Foxe and not I who has been acting as the lone person.
[Johnpacklambert]: The main reason is that I am unconvinced that for these people it is a central enough issue to be noted.  The fact is that they either need to be in \""American Mormon Missionaries\"" or \""American Latter Day Saints\"" and which one to put them in is the question.  My general decision is that since Mormon refers to \""the Mormon Church\"" and the Mormon Church is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, if their main claim to fame relates to actions they did that led to their excommunication from the Church of latter that I remove that category.  However even that is not a consistent answer.  At some level I am unconvinced that \""American Mormon Missionaries\"" is a worthwhile category.  Arguably I should either remove all the categorizations or remove \""American Latter Day Saint\"" from all the categories.  There also a few people where I have decided that putting them in the category \""American Mormon Missionaries\"" might be misconstued to consider their current actions reflecting this.  The case where this was most clearly the motivation for my decision was with the current US Ambassador to Jordan.  I decided that putting him in this category might be considered by some to be a statement that his current position or actions are as such.  This might be a case of taking too much precation over a threat that is not really present, but with the violent anti-proselyting actions of many in the Middle East I decided it was better to err on the side of caution and avoid anything that might be construed as such.  I am not all thatparticular about any of these particular edits, so feel free to reverse them.  However if you do you probably should remove those articles from the parent category.
[Johnpacklambert]: The Ezra Booth edit is based on the assumption that \""former Latter Day Saints\"" and \""American Latter Day Saints\"" are mutually exclusive.  I am not sure what other category edits you dislike.  I removed the various family categories from the \""American Latter Day Saints\"" category for three reasons.  One is that it does not really fit, since the category is for individuals not groups.  The second is that some members of the mentioned families are not Latter-day Saints.  The biggest reason though was in many of the cases how American some members of the family were was in doubt.  The vast majority of my edits have been removing people from \""American Latter Day Saints\"" when they are also in the category \""American Mormon missionaries\"" since the later is a sub-category of the former this is a justified alteration.
[Johnpacklambert]: Others of my edits have been removing people from the category \""American Latter Day Saints\"" when they were in the category \""Mormon pioneers\"".  This is also justified since the later is a sub-category of the former.  Since being a Mormon pioneer involves having moved to Utah, Arizona, Nevada or Idaho, but primarily Utah, prior to 1869 under the auspices of the Mormon Church, it seems that classifying all these people as in some way American works.  If it does not the issue needs to be taken up over the matter of the classification of the category Mormon Pioneers.  Another two of my edits have been based on the assumption that since American Latter Day Saint hymnwriters is a subcategory of American Latter Day Saint writers which in turn is a sub-category of American Latter Day Saints.  there is no point to having people in it also be in the category American Latter Day Saints.
[Johnpacklambert]: This is why I did not try to revert the change.  You are probably right it did not make sense, but it does go back to the question of including people in both the LDS and former LDS categories.  I guess though we can point out that in general if someone was at one point in a given religion and they are notably connected with it, then they are so categorized, so I guess my thought process was flawed on this one.
[Johnpacklambert]: The whole article in question has long been an attack article on a researcher who has been willing to do longitudinal studies in a field where most people do not.  The decision to remove this section was brought about by a radical feminist who is trying to use the biased attack nature of this article to suppress the truth and have more women commit suicide.  The fact that this article is havily biased has been widely noted by multiple people, and the fact that a lot of these attacks have been built on the \""that publication is unreliable\"" claims are just not the type of things that make me want to tolerate this article.  It is bad enough that the politically operated APA is treated as if it is a legitimate organization in this article.  It tells you something that up until today instead of listing the multiple publications Dr. Coleman has, the article constituted merely an attack article.  That is what is not encyclopedic about the whole thing.
[Johnpacklambert]: That is easy for radical feminist like you who go around supressing the truth to say.  You are the one who openly mocked another editor for seeking to make an article something other than an unending attack piece.  Your mocking of people for not bowing down to the will of a few self-apointed \""experts\"" clearly constituted a personal attack.
[Johnpacklambert]: This is an unjustified action.  I was warned about edit warring, and did absolutely nothing after the warning was published and was then unilaterally blocked.  This is patently unfair.  If you are going to warn people that continued edit warring will result in their being blocked, than you should give them the chance to follow this directive before they are blocked.  This is an unjustified and heavy-handed action that has no justicfication.  You warn people against an action, and then punish them for the action without giving them any chance to change.  This is just not a logical course of action.
[Johnpacklambert]: Your actions still constitute what I feel is clearly over-bearing action. I was clearly told that '''if''' I continued edit warring I would be blocked.  You did not even give me a chance to follow those direction.  This is not a fair response.  If someone has specifically said that if I continue exit warring I will be blocked, I should at least be given the right to respond to that instruction.  To just come in and block someone when they have not even had a chance to show a willingness to respond to directives is clearly unfair.  If someone says \""stop doing x or be punished\"" it is just wrong to come and punish someone when they do no more x.  I had not done any edits at all during the time period in question.  I was given a warning and never given a chance to show any willingness to follow the warning.  This is clearly not a fair situation.
[Johnpacklambert]: I will admit I did go a overboard in my statements.  Still, if you are going to criticize others for rash comments, I think you need to consider that you own mocking of other people's edits is not at all conducive to civility.  It is patently unfair when the provoker is counted innocent and the provoked is treated as if he acted in a vacuum.
[Johnpacklambert]: Why do I have to be civil, but you can engage in such ad hominem attacks.  Basically you are saying you will not collaborate with anyone who believes differently than you.
[Johnpacklambert]: Technicality?  You clearly do not believe in such American concepts as the rule of law.  If someone is told to desist or they will be punished, you can not punish them before they even have a chance to desist.  That is just plain unfair.  Basically on the other hand you are arguing that you should be able to exclude everyone who believes that abortion causes negative mental health results from the entirety of wikipedcia.  Your comment on fairness makes absolutely no sense.  You started out with your first edit by insulting me, and have since acted as if I was the one out of line.  Why you think that you can insult other people's edits and have them like it is beyond me.
[Johnpacklambert]: You still ignored the fact that I was given a warning and in all fairness if someone is given a warning they should be able to show a willingness to follow the warning.
[Johnpacklambert]: Your tolerance of MastCell's continued, snyde, unjustified comments is also questionable.  I see no reason why you tolerate his denigrating comments towards view of the ''New York Times''. The determination to insult me for not accepting the ''Times'' as some sort of greater authority shows a continued willingness to personalize this and to denigrate those who do not agree with his political views.
[Johnpacklambert]: I think administrators should consider the emotional costs on blocked people.  This is especially true when it allows others to continue un-answered their mocking attacks on the page that evidently was suffering from an edit war.
[Johnpacklambert]: I would say that these policies have been adequately explained.  Although I have to admit my first response to this whole situation is a desire to just avoid even semi-contentious articles in the future.  The problem is that is not really an adequate solution, and instead patient examination of the issues is required.  I can think of little else to say at the moment.  I am afraid to explain another factor because of the general dislike and stigma attached to mental illness.
[Johnpacklambert]: I guess there is one issue related to edit warring that I would like to get cleared up.  Let me point out that I realize that the main complaints relative to me comments relate to civility and no personal attacks.  My question is, can entering comments on an article be used in figuring if edit warring is occuring, or is edit warring limited to actions done on the article itself.
[Johnpacklambert]: I should further point out that I do not see that this is a direct issue at the present, but I am just asking for future reference.
[Johnpacklambert]: We still have some small sections besides indepdent study.  I think there might be more information on the Neuro-science center.  On the other hand these three things could be shifted over to \""BYU Research Institutes\"".  That would probably make more sense in the long run.  The Research Institutes is not very clear what it has, and Neuroscience could probably be put there.  It might even be possible to define it as its own page.  On the other hand maybe the remnants of the page could be merged up into the BYU page, but I personally find that page too long and hard to navigate.
[Johnpacklambert]: I figured out how to realign everything else to specific college articles.  This means that we are left with the BYU Independent Study section.  That could probably stand on its own, especially if a little more historical information could be found.  So with that seperated off into its own category, this page could probably be deleted.
[Johnpacklambert]: I would suggest you read this [[WP:OC#Eponymous]] policy statement before making any more comments on wikipedia category deletion debates.  Your comments show that you are unaware of the relevant rules for category making.
[Johnpacklambert]: The text in question is subjected to GNU licensing.
[Johnpacklambert]: Census data does back up my statement.  The problem is the way the census data tables work.  If you go to the census factfinder page and do a search for Abbeville, Kansas and go to the Race, Hispanic or Latino, Age, and Housing Occupancy: 2010 table which has the ID of QT-PL, you will find all the infomation I listed reported.  I am not sure why copying the www address at the top of my page when I am getting the information does not work, but the information is definately available from the census website.
[Johnpacklambert]: The category I was trying to add did in fact exist.  I just misspelled it.  However, you are presenting a catch-22.  If I create a category with no articles that will get deleted as well.
[Johnpacklambert]: The article was created by copying a section of another wikipedia article.  There have been some revisions to it, but I figured material from another wikipedia article could be copied without violating copyright.
[Johnpacklambert]: Davshul, I did put up Cfd banners.  Al-Andulusi came along and unilaterally deleted them claiming there was a consensus to keep the categories.  I made sure to put banners on all the categories.
[Johnpacklambert]: The category says it is for people who died \""c. 1209\"".  Thus my categorization is in line with what the category says it is for.
[Johnpacklambert]: I have an idea of why circa is allowed in one and not the other.  It is because anyone who died is not living, and the biggest worries in wikipedia accuracy relate to the living.
[Johnpacklambert]: I did revert my edit of de Crobeil.  In general my theory is if other people have issues with my edits they can alter or revert them.  I have come up with more theories on this matter.  I know enough about geneology to know people have come up with a lot of ways of estimating birth years, but few of estimating death years.  This means that there are a lot of questionable theories used to dedcae when people were born, but few used to come up with deaths.  This means an estimate of when someone died is generally on much sounder ground than birth estimates.  Thus a supposed death date tends to be more accurate than a supposed birth date.
[Johnpacklambert]: This is the chart that is the first result for a search on the given locality on the census website.  In the past I tried linking to them, but it seemed the links were not working.  I think it is actually called the general population and housing report, or maybe even something longer than that.  This report is key to finding things like sub-groupings under the heading \""asian\"".  It also gives sub-groupings of Hispanic and Latino, median age, age distribution tables and a few other things.  The second report is much shorter since it only gives the large race categories, hispanic and latino and not hispanic and latino by race, the number of house holds and the number of housing units.  Both are helpful compared with some of the other reports in giving percentages.  I will see if linking to them will work, but do not make any gaurantees.
[Johnpacklambert]: As you will see from this link [http:\/\/factfinder2.census.gov\/faces\/tableservices\/jsf\/pages\/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_DP_DPDP1&prodType=table] the 80,530 population is the official 2010 census population of Buena Park.  I have not entered population per square mile figures for any place.  I will chekc the Buena Park situation to see if I can make the edits more clear.
[Johnpacklambert]: Buena Park was a mess to begin with.  They were listing figures for 2010 that were clearly not the 2010 figures.  I have seperated off those, and put the note they might be 2000 figures.  As you will see I have generally tried to list the 2010 populations and other matter as an addendum leaving the existing 2000 population figures.  I would reccomend against indiscriminate re-calibrating of population density unless you are sure the area of the place has not changed in the last decade.  I can safely state that my edit makes it clear what is 2010 census data, and what belongs to other things.  In general I would say do not trust non-census data to be as accurate.  Remember since the census estimates of race between dicennial censuses exclude non-household residents they will in some cases produce significantly different results.  In other places were over 98% of the population is in households they probably will be the same, so Buena Park at 99% of the population living in households does not provide such an issue.
[Johnpacklambert]: I figures out what the higher population number was.  It was the California Department of Finance population estimate.  It also is dated to January 1, 2010; the census is to April 1, 2010.  The census sent agents at least three times to every place they had not gotten forms from.  They were seeking to see if someone was living in residences with no outward signs of habitation that appeared to have been unlived in for years.  I would trust their figures more than the California Department of Finance, and using census figures is the norm.  The figures I have been citing have been universally from the 2010 census.  I have major distrust for the California Department of Finace figures, they had neither the law nor the resource nor the throughness to compete with the census.  Anyway who knows what happened in the four intervening months.
[Johnpacklambert]: I went through your page links and it leads me to the various 2010 census data tables if you go to the new page.  That is where you want to go, to the new fact finder data.  I have not been editing the lead and side-chart population data.  My main goal is getting correct data included in the demographic section.
[Johnpacklambert]: You are probably right that the newest demographic data should go first.  I am mainly ambivalent on the issue.
[Johnpacklambert]: It is good to get encoragement.  I just thought of another possible source of confusion.  Some places have both a city population and a census county division population.  The latter will include the unincorporated areas surrounded by the city.  This would be a factor in several cities in Orange County and may be the source of the misleading figures appearing in some articles.
[Johnpacklambert]: I have totally changed the reading of the 2010 La Palma, California demographics figures for two reason.  First off it makes no sense to list the number of people in each racial group instead of the percentages.  Percentages are the better way to go.  However I am pointing this out to you for the second reason, that is that you made statements about the data that are not supported by the data.  Specifically you do not know how many of the various Asian populations sub-groups, such as Koreans, may or may not have been part of the 0.3% of the population that was Asian and Hispanic or Latino.  You are mixing and misreading your sources.  For all you know all 0.3% of the Hispanic Asian are Korean.  On the other hand for all you know absolutly none of them are Korean.  You can not legitimately list the Korean population when specifying the non-Hispanic or Latino population of La Palma, or in fact any place that has any Hispanic or Latino Asians.

Specifically you do not know how many of the various Asian populations sub-groups, such as Koreans, may or may not have been part of the 0.3% of the population that was Asian and Hispanic or Latino.  You are mixing and misreading your sources.  For all you know all 0.3% of the Hispanic Asian are Korean.  On the other hand for all you know absolutly none of them are Korean.  You can not legitimately list the Korean population when specifying the non-Hispanic or Latino population of La Palma, or in fact any place that has any Hispanic or Latino Asians.
[Johnpacklambert]: Hmm, that is very odd.  I copy the page header from the page I am looking at with the relevant data from the 2010 census.  I am not sure why it does not work as a link.  Due to only using the short form and not the long form, the 2010 census data will not have all the information that the 2000 census data had.  I know for sure it does not repeat the complicated ancesty tables, nor the percentage immigrant figures (they did not enquire about place of birth) nor the language spoken at home figures.  It is true that this information was included only for some places in our reprots about the 2000 census.  For [[Closter, New Jersey]] I have included a note part-way through the 2010 census data explaining why the 2010 figure on the percentage of the population that is Korean by race is in theory potentially smaller than the figure that is Korean by ancestry.  I am wondering if it is worth pointing out that there is a possibiity that some people might report their race as Korean and not their ancestroy as such, I am thinking it is vaguely possible that adopted Korean children in white or other non-Korean American families might possibly report their ancestroy based on adoption and their race based on birth, but I am not sure that there is any evidence that such is the case, so I am not sure it is reportable.  There is clear evidence that there are people who report being multiple races including Asian, and good reason to suspect some of the people who report such report being Korean, and no reason to suspect that there are sero cases of people reporting being Korean and some other Asian race and being counted in the other Asian category due to census reporting of Asianess policies, so these seem well justified assumptions.  Due to privacy laws there is unlikely to be evidence to confirm or deny my theory about the possibility that adopted Korean children in non-Korean families might possibly have reported ancestry and race differently until 2072.  Even at that I am not sure I really think very many such reports are likely, and if anything such a total disconnected from Korean ancestry might be even less likely in a heavily Korean place like Closter than in an area with few Koreans.  So I am thinking that I will just leave the note as is.  However, I am just trying to get my head around the concept.
[Johnpacklambert]: The ancestroy data is one of the more complexed things in the 2010 census.  It is collected seperately from the racial and ethnic (basically Hispanic or not-Hispanic, which I have always thought was an oddity) data.  They allowed people to report up to two ancestries.  This way people could report being German, Arabic, Jewish, Kashubian or Chaldean, all of which if written under \""some other race\"" for race would be re-counted as white.  For the purposes of Koreaness which was the cited figure in Closter because it was exceptionally high (although the Korean population would nearly double in Closter over the next decade, but that is another story) there are a few other exceptions that make this figure only generally comparable.  On race you can mark in theory an almost unlimited number of races.  In practice it gets difficult to mark above 16 and it is unlikely that many people marked above 6.  however there are probably well over 1000 people (if not many more than that) who marked at least three races.  I am pretty sure one of my brothers did this for his children on the supposed theory that his Mexican wife has an ancestor from China.  I have known people many people (most of them from Hawaii) who had well documented ancestries of three races with their grandparents representing three different races.  I have also known people who were self described Italian, Welsh and French-Candiana with thier grand parents clearly representing these three ancestries.  The problem is that the census in 2000 only allowed people to report at most two ancestries.  It was also only allowed at all on the long form, which only about one sixth of the population filled out, so it is obtained by a slightly different method than other figures.  Despite the limit of two ancestries, and the ease of reporting up to 16 races at least if they are the right 16 and the extreme ease of reporting up to four, a much higher percentage of the population reported multiple ancestries than multiple races, of course this is because my Italian, Welsh and French-Candiana friend would be by most rubrics only white in race.
[Johnpacklambert]: My agenda is not racism.  It is reporting racial statistics based on how people actually use the term.  That is not racist, that is realism.  Anyway you ignore the fact that the data is complexed.  Non-Hispanic white was the only non-Hispanic figure that was reported for the 2000 census.  The 2010 data allows much more fine tuning of the figures.  I have in some cases even specified the population that is Hispanic black.  What you are ignoring is the extent to which the white figure in census reports has been messed with.  The fact of the matter is that most people do not think of Mexicans as being white, and to report them as such in a general way is just to confuse the data.  If I could I would also report the non-Arab or non-Middle Eastern white figure.  Arabs and Chaldenas know they are not white, are treated as non-whites, and should not be counted as white.  However for reasons that boggle my mind they are counted in the white figure.  Beyond this you are totally ignoring my figure for the \""non-Hispanic from some other race\"".  This is the closest we have to a figure of people who are in a racial group that the census has not adequately considered in their limited racial scheme.  Exactly why it is \""racist\"" for a Native American to want to seperate out these figures is beyond me.  Your yelling of racist because I try to reflect how people really think about race is just off base.  I am trying to make the figures reflect how people think about these things, and that is built around delineating the non-Hispanic white population.  There is a reason this is the only specific non-Hispanic population delineated in the 2000 census.  Anyway, with it being the largest population, seperately delinating it makes it so the race data is more meaningful.  This is also why the Asian racial data works best with the very, very small percentage of Hispanics who are Asian included.  The reality is actually the reverse of what you state.  The three races that I most often report the non-Hispanic percentages for are the ones where the percentages of Hispanicness tend to be the highest.  The non-Hispanic Asian population tends to be very close to the overall Asian population, thus making reporting both figures not worth while.  On the other hand the white population with Hispanics included tends to be quite different than the non-Hispanic white population.  This is best illustrated in parts of south Texas where both the Hispanic and white populations are over 80%.  Yet realistically the vast majority of south Texans think of whites as other than themselves and so the non-Hispanic white figure is the one that most accurately reflects the way people think about racial groupings.  The cry of \""racism\"" for reporting race figures from the census is the type of anti-information call that should be avoided in census figures.  You make no sense at all.  Racism is the belief that one race is inherently better than another.  Even if your accusation of my dark purpose worked, my actions are not racist.  There is no way that doing anything with data is racist.  You have no evidence that I am in any way saying that one race is better than another, because I am not.  Thinking that Hispanics are not white is '''not''' racist.  You are misusing the term.  Whether Hispanics are white is a question of racial classification.  It is not racist to classify people by race, especially when it is a system where every person gets to mark what race they are.  If you were to insist that we should only report the total sum of races people marked, then we should be using different figures than the ones you cite.  We should be using the total of each race figure.  Hmm, maybe i should use those and thus avoid being called racist.
[Johnpacklambert]: The simplest reason why I specify non-Hispanic white is because that is the figure that needs to be cited to determine if the place has a Hispanic plurality population or not.  There are exceptions to this.  In certain areas it might be non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic Native American or so forth.  In parts of Hawaii it might be non-Hispanic Pacific Islander that would alter the balance.  If you are going to go balistic because people try to make the data so it is readable, you might as well criticize me for not including the 0.0% Pacific Islander and other 0.0% figures where they would come up if I slavishly followed the data.  Beyond this, you ignored my whole point which is that you do not know what percentages of Koreans in a given locality reported being Hispanic when 0.3% of the population reported being both Asian and Hispanic (not counting those who may have reported being Asian and white, black, Native American, Pacific Islander or some other race while being Hispanic, since 2.6% of the population of La Palma marked Asian as well as at least one of those other races, while 1.4% of the population reported being Hispanic and reported at least two races, so in theory all (although in practice probably less than all, but from the data the census has given we do nto know) of the 1.4% of Hispanic who marked being more than one race could have marked being Asian, I do not know, but they are not part of the Korean percentage, so I am getting off the point), you can not them break out the non-Hispanic Korean because the only report on the number of Koreans in the population includes both those Koreans who marked themselves as non-Hispanic and those Koreans who marked themselves as Hispanic.  That was the point I made before and for some reason you have chosen to respond to this point with beligerence while ignoring what I am actually saying.
[Johnpacklambert]: You are missing the Hispanic white population.  That is why it says \""non-Hispanic white\"".  Those figures will only go to close to 100% if the Hispanic white population is included.  The edit I did on [[La Palma, California]] would give in theory a further from 100% figure, since it included \""non-Hispanic from some other race\"".  The complicating thing might be that the way it is phrased \""some other race\"" might be thought to include Hispanic whites.  However that is not a term used to gather up the excess in making this specific chart, it is a term used in the census and a line where people mark and then write in their race.  Thus it is a proactively gathered \""so,e other race\"" , not a residual of interpreting the figures.  On the other hand if you look at some of the figures given in my most recent edits of New Jersey locations you will come to a figure noticably above 100%.  That is because I used the total by race figure instead of the total by race with those who marked some other race besides that specific race excluded.  In some ways this is the more realistic reflection of what the census actually shows, since people who instead of marking being both black and white, wrote in Mulatto would be counted as 'some other race\"" and in fact, the census itself claims the main purpose of the \""some other race\"" heading is to allow people who identify with a multi-racial identifier to be able to fill out the census.  I think the main problem is that \""some other race\"" looks like a catchall but is infact a fairly specific term (which the census deliberately under reports by shifting those who write in things like \""Arab\"" in that line to being white before releasing the figures, but that is an issue that we wont be able to counteract until 2072, and only then if they did not do that before compiling the census records themselves).
[Johnpacklambert]: The first sentance might have been the only needed explanation.
[Johnpacklambert]: If you study through census figures you will learn that the white total does infact include Iranians.  It took a bit of digging but I found the official census report where it explains that if you mark \""other\"" and write in your race as Iranian than the report for your location will have recounted you as white.  This is an important thing to bear in mind to understand what is going on with the populations of palces that are known to have large mideastern populations.  People have written whole books complaining about the fact that the census and some other places treat mid-easterners as white but in general they are not treated as such or thought of as such.  It might be better to include this in a footnote, but the fact of the matter is that if we do not explain this is what is going on people might be confused.
[Johnpacklambert]: You are to some extent ignoring the fact that the percentage of the population that is Latino or Hispanic is included in the list.  You did not include that percentage in your addition.  If you had the result probably would have been closer to 107%, but it would have not been less than 100%.  It would also be possible to include seperately the percentage of Hispanic whites.  Due to the fact my last edit of Galt caused a threat to ban me from editing, I am not going to touch that article with a 10 foot poll, but the percentage of Hispanic whites is listed within the 2010 general profile of population and housing characteristics for Galt provided by the US Census, so if you go to the www.census.gov website it will not be hard for you to find it.
[Johnpacklambert]: The above mentioned table will be the first result of the factfinder2 search for Galt city, California.  The Hispanic white figure will be about 2\/3rds of the way down the chart in the second table that mentions Hispanics.
[Johnpacklambert]: Actually if you pay close attention to the data included in some reports at times people give the non-Hispanic white total without explaining that is what they are doing.  Beyond this some other methods of data gathering outside the census treat Hispanic as a race and create a non-comparable set of data.
[Johnpacklambert]: Since I have found a book that published a report that made it seem every last person in Georgia in 1990 was either white or black, when there were several hundred if not thousand people who reported being Asian, Native American and so forth that year, I would have to say your belief that people accurately report what census data says is misplaced.
[Johnpacklambert]: The census questions have not changed since 1990, only the rules for answering them have changed.  That is in 2000 they statrted allowing people to state multiple races.  The exact wording of the question on being Hispanic or Latino has also changed, but the change actually makes it slightly less likely that a person would answer yes to the question.  There were enough Vietnamese and other Asian in Georgia in 1990 that htey should have not been totalluy ignored.  Also starting no latter than 1970 there has been a significant increase in the number of native Americans in each census which can only be explained by people switching their self identification of their race, and Georgia is one of the states that has been efected by this process.  Of course Georgia is also one of two states that saw the fastest increase in its Hispanic population in the 1990s (the other was North Carolina) and so Georgia much more than most states has definantly had a change away from being a state that can easily be pigeon holded in the binary racial project.  I can say these things without really knowing what has happened in Georgia since 2000, but my very loose sense of the matter is that the processes of the 1990s have continued, although maybe not at such a fast pace.
[Johnpacklambert]: \""two or more\"" is not an option per se.  The option are white, black or African American, American Indian or Alaskan Native, with lines with both those sub-options to write in the tribe, Asian broken down into Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Filipino, Asian Indian and other Asian with a line to write in what other race, Native Hawaiian or other pacific Islander, with specific delineation of Native Hawaiian, Samoan and Chamorro or Guamanian with a line to write in another Pacific Islander race and other.  A person can mark as many of these race lines as they chose.  There is no question that specifically asks the person whether they identifiy as having more than one race.  Thus at some level it might be more reflective of the data gathering method itself to report the totals marked for each race and thus report numbers that add to more than 1005 because each race will potentially have people in it who also marked a different race.  To me the most frustrating thing is for races that are treated as sub-races the total number who marked that race is not reported.  Personally I view the Asian race as an artificial creation, throwing together East Asian and South Asian, who are viewed as two seperate racial groups (and maybe south east Asians, or at least Filipinos\/Indonesians as another distinct racial group) by almost everyone who thinks about this matter.  Of course to make things more interesting in 1990 there was the truly unreflective of reality racial group Asian and Pacific Islander, and some people have not yet realized that this artificial construct racial group has been disbanded.  I believe it is the article [[List of places in the United States with Asian American majority populations]] that includes a direct assertion that East Asians and South Asians are different racial groups.  of course there is no gathering of South Asian data, there are probably people who mark \""Pakistani\"" and \""Bangladeshi\"" under other Asian, and there may even be people who chose to mark \""Gujarati\"" or who knows what else there.  Then there is the Afghan population, which no one knows what race they are.  This is a real issue in understanding Fremont, California.
[Johnpacklambert]: The Pennsylvania State issue that I most recently posted is different though.  The name has not changed.  The use of a nichname is an independent issue.  I think the one I posted before that was to change to agreement with the cat name, technically the actual name of the place was being used in the cat but it was ambiguous.
[Johnpacklambert]: Palestine was not a geographical entity during the Ottoman period.  This is the relevant passagfe from the article [[History of Palestine]].  \""After the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest, the name \""Palestine\"" was no longer used as the official name of an administrative unit, as the Turks often called their (sub)provinces after the capital. The majority of historical Palestine became part of the'' [[vilayet]]'' ([[Subdivisions of the Ottoman Empire|province]]) of Damascus-Syria until 1660, and later became part of the ''vilayet'' of [[Sidon|Saida]] (Sidon).\""  Thus, to refer to people as Palestinian during that time frame is questionable.  You are also ignoring the fact many people live places where they do not become part of the local population.  This is why we have [[:Category:American expatriates in France]] as a distinct category from [[:Category:American emigrants to France]] to give just one example.  Beyond this, the Ottoman period begins in 1515, the British period ends in 1947.  Neither fits well with a century break.  If the 430 entries is deemed to large for a category the appropriate action would be to create [[:Category:Rabbis in Ottoman Palestine]] and [[:Category:Rabbis in British Palestine]].  If it is determined that rabbis by century needs to be georgraphically subdivided, which seems unlikely when [[:Category:16th-century rabbis]] has only 68 entries, and it is further determined that the at most 30 of those that fall into the new category [[:Category:16th-century rabbis of the Ottoman Empire]] are still to large and unwiedy, then the logical action would be to form [[:Category:16th-century rabbis in Palestine]].  This is especially true since the goal of this category seems to be based around an unspoken assumption that since Palestine is the claimed ancestral homeland of the Jews (a claim that is probably justified, but when is usually posited in a way to ignore the Kazars, the Arabs who converted to Judaism, the large number of Jewish proselytes throughout the Roman Empire and so forth, although all these facts can be accepted and not diminish the claim if we argue it is the peoplehood and not the blood ancestry that matters) the question is \""did these rabbis work, teach and write in Palestine\"" not \""did they live there\"" let alone were they in some way people of there.  The way this category is concieved if a rabbi was born in Safed but spent his whole career as a rabbi in Constantinople or Salonika he would not belong in the category.
[Johnpacklambert]: The German Airforce does not equal the Nazis.  Bombings of anything in Brittain by the German airforce are not actions of the Nazis.
[Johnpacklambert]: Neither of the previous discussion came to any precedent.  In the more recent one the specific objections to specificly difficult constructs were ignored in the final judgement which was just there was no consensus.  Neither of these categories have ever been brought up specifically on their individual merits where discussion of their unique dificulty can be done.  There is no ownership of categories so there is no reason to notify people about potential category name changes.  Anyway, these are rename not delete nominations.
[Johnpacklambert]: We still refuse to divide actor categories by gender.  Is not nominating categories for CfD the proper way to bring in more participation?
[Johnpacklambert]: The Febuary discussion seemed to point towards \""People educated at\"".  either early this month or late last month I made several nominations to move things to \""People educated at X\"" and all of those passed.  Most of the categories created this year are named \""people educated at X\"", and I do not believe any \""former pupils of X\"" categories were created this year.  Of course there is no clear consensus, which is why I did not try to speedy these nominations.  People are welcome to make their views known in the various CfDs.
[Johnpacklambert]: The nominations I refered to were made back on July 7th.
[Johnpacklambert]: It is most frustrating how people insist on treating different nominations as a group.  Icenians are a unique and difficult case.  Old Lansing has the bizarre non-plural form, and Down House Seniors is not like anything else.  It is quite frustrating that people act as if the problems of Bristolians, Gregorians, Elizabethans are easy to subsume into one large discussion.  I nominated each of these seperately because the issues of each is seperate and unique, and therefore the resolution needs to be unique.  At one point I thought of trying to explain more clearly how we do not use individualized jargon elsewhere, in matters of city origin or any other schools, but it seems that with many people this is a lost cause.
[Johnpacklambert]: On a different note, I am trying to figure out was happened to the rename nomination of [[:Category:Old Georgians (KGV)]].  It is not on the page anymore as far as I can tell.  Was it moved or did someone delete it or what?
[Johnpacklambert]: I found and restored that section.
[Johnpacklambert]: I do not care what you call the orgin year of the City of Nedlands.  However your use of est makes it a direct part of [[:Category:1893 establishments]].  Since it is in subcats of that cat like [[:Category:1893 establishments in Australia]] it should not be directly in that category.  You need to find a way to list the year of establishment without automatically making it part of the category.  This seems to only happen with Australia locations.  I am not sure why, but it is a problem that needs to be fixed.

[Johnpacklambert]: Since this went through CfD, I am not sure why you are talking about things like \""you would not have gotten away with it\"".  The parent category was delted, so the issue is more complexed than you are acknowledging.  Anyway, there is absolutely no reason at all to have empty cats.  Beyond this you ignore that there is another matter besides being true or false.  How far back can we go to search out Jewish ancestry.  Is the fact that [[Hugh Nibley]] had one great-grandfather who was Jewish before he converted to Christianity in about 1820 enouygh to put this man born in 1910 in the applicable category.  What about his daughter [[Martha Beck]] who was born in 1962, thus about 140 years after her last ancestor stopped being Jewish, and she is only 1\/16th Jewish.  Do we really want a system where we could put people in each of the applicable ancestry cats for all 16 of their great-grandparents.
[Johnpacklambert]: I would also note that four people supported my nomination.  I was not the one who deleted your recreation of the cat, so complaining here will not help you.
[Johnpacklambert]: However we explicitly state that people should not be in both these categories.  Also you say \""Jews are ''typically'' of Jewish descent\"" which means that they are not always.  However if we make Jews a subcat of people of Jewish descent it will encorage putting Jews into the People of Jewish descent cats, which we do not want.  It is very explicitly stated that Jews do not belong in the people of Jewish descent categories.  If we put the Fooian Jews in these categories it will encorage people to mix the two categories which are to be distinct and non-overlapping.
[Johnpacklambert]: There is no consensus to create subcats of this category.  Women and occupation intersection cats should only be created where there is consensus that this is a notable interaction, so there is no point in assuming that most of these women should go in any women related cats for both being a women in a given occupation and being Hispanic.  The sub-tree of Hispanic and Latino American women that was attempted was deleted as not useful.  There are subcats here, but no consesus to create other subcats.
[Johnpacklambert]: Sadia Shepherd's last Jewish ancestor lived in India.  In fact her ancestors stopped being Jews before Pakistan was even formed.  You can not say she in anyway has Pakistani Jewish ancestry.
[Johnpacklambert]: The issue is that Shepherd's last Jewish ancestor was a resident of India.  India is not limited to the modern Republic of India.  Before the formation there was British India.  Thus we would accurately describe the emigrants from the Punjab to Caifornia in the 1910s as \""Indian emigrants to the United States\"" because they came from what was then British India to the United States.  We would not have to determine which side of a line not drawn until 1947 they came from to properly classify them.
[Johnpacklambert]: Some other good cats to look into on this matter are [[:Category:Yugoslav emigrants to the United States]] and [[:Category:Soviet emigrants to the United States]] and [[:Category:Austro-Hungarian emigrants to the United States]].  We still have these cats even though none of these countries still exist.  Then there is [[:category:German emigrants to the United States]] in which we include Polish-speaking emigrants from Poland who came to the US in 1917 or earlier (although realistically they probably all came before the US joined WWI in 1916, and mainly before the war started in 1914, but that is another issue).  The fact that Posen was put in Poland at the end of World War I, and that Germany still existed but with consticted boundaries is not relevant.  In emigration cats we categorize by the state of what countries were at the time the person left for their new country.  The one slight caviate is if you have evidence the person was granted citizenship by the new country even though they were abroad and then formally because a citizen of another country, but since wikipedia is uspposed to be based on published sources and these will more likely speak of when the person moved to a new country and not in generally tell us when they were naturalized and what citizenship they renounced at the time, it is generally best to us the date of movement unless it is clear some other date is more applicable.
[Johnpacklambert]: [[Sadia Sheperd]] is in category [[Mujahir]].  Whether she qualifies as the American-born child of a muhajir is beyond what I care about right now.  The point is that the definition of this term is \""a term used to describe the Muslim immigrants from India\"" to Pakistan.  They are people who emigrated from India to Pakistan, thus they were Indian before emigration and at least according to the wikipedia article on the matter did not come to Pakistan until after the particion of India.
[Johnpacklambert]: Said Shepherd was born in the US. She is an American.  Pakistani people are people who are from Pakistan, Shepherd is an American of Pakistani descent, she is not a Pakistani.  If there were an article on her mother you could put her mother in that cat.  However Pakistani people is meant for people who are Pakistani by nationality, not people born in other countries who had Pakistani parents (especially when it is only one parent who is Pakistani).  No every detail of a persons geneology needs to be used to put them in a category.  Categories are best used to cover the actions and events of peoples lives, and ancestral categories should not be multiplied unreasonably.  I guess you could add her to something like [[:Category:Makers of films on Jewish subjects]].  That would seem to be a much more useful category than trying to describe her truly weak connection to Judaism as a personal attribute cat.
[Johnpacklambert]: The book I mentioned above was Kenneth Coleman, ed., ''A History of Georgia'' Athens, Georgia and London: University of Georgia Press, 1991 (second edition). The chart where they classify every last person in Gerogia as either white or black, not only in 1990, but for every year they give figures from 1752 onward (evidently the Cherokees who were no removed from Gerogia until the 1830s were not people) is found on p. 415.  This book is all the more egregious since it was published by a university press.

[Xymmax]: Ack, and now I see you've nominated me! Thanks so much, but I'm going to decline. I may seek it one day, but for now I plan to take my own advice, and do lots of regular editor things. Again, thanks for the kind thoughts, and feel free to ask me if you have Wiki questions.
[Xymmax]: of [[Ryan Coonerty|this article]] probably violates [[WP:OUTING|this policy]], please self revert as soon as you can. Thanks (and thanks for taking an interest in the article.
[Xymmax]: Well, none of that has happened on-wiki, and I'm not sure its a good idea to bring it here. We can deal with the COI issue without it - I've made some edits to the article, and will try to continue to smooth it out. I'm trying to avoid needless drama (and trust me, I won't be starting any :)
[Xymmax]: Maybe, but we're both involved now. Do you think it's worth going to ANI over?
[Xymmax]: I've got to say, I disagree with almost everything I read up here. But, there's no reason that you shouldn't have file mover; I added the permission.
[Xymmax]: Thanks. I don't know how much I'll participate, but you did point out a history merge that I need to attend to, and that's appreciated.
[Xymmax]: Ah,took me a moment to remember which case we're talking about, but I've got it now. I'll comment over at the discussion.
[Xymmax]: This is excellent news, and I'm pleased to hear it. I think that the batch uploading process is the proper one to use on Commons, although I'm not terribly active there. I don't expect that it will be too difficult to recruit someone to assist in automating this process once we know the permission is in hand. If Mr. Whytehead is willing to make the requisite release under CC-BY-SA 3.0, then I'll be happy to scare up someone that perform the transfer. The evidence of permission can be sent to OTRS at permissions-commons@wikimedia.org.  Happy to help any way I can.
[Xymmax]: I deleted the page as part of my closing of the [[WP:Articles for deletion|Articles for deletion]] discussion. This article was nominated by a user who felt that it violated our content policies.  The discussion stayed open for seven days, then I closed it. You can see the [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\/Jack Hoban|discussion here]].  As you will see, all of those who offered comments recommended deletion.  If you feel that my decision was in error, you can \""appeal\"" by listing the article at [[WP:deletion review|deletion review]].  You may wish to read the [[wp:bio|notability of persons]] guideline to get a better idea about what is required to have a Wikipedia artice. Take care,"
Nova77,False,[Nova77]: Thank you for your contribution to the [[Autocorrelation]] article with a picture. Unfortunately I cannot display it with my version of Firefox (''Mozilla\/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko\/20061204 Firefox\/2.0.0.1''): the picture is simply blank. Do you have an idea why is this happening?
{unknown-5850},False,"[{unknown-5850}]: Sure, I'll take a look at it soon. <span style=\""white-space:nowrap;\"">{&#123;"
MacGyverMagic,True,"[MacGyverMagic]: I'm not sure wether you're familiar with the section, but I'd like to ask you to check [[Template talk:Did you know]]. You updated just one fact when there was whole list of ones waiting to be included. No obligations, of course, just to let you know. I've taken the liberty of updating the other 3 facts. [[User:MacGyverMagic|
[MacGyverMagic]: I think it's fairly old. Can't be sure though I haven't been editing DYK for very long. :) [[User:MacGyverMagic|
[MacGyverMagic]: I see you often oppose featured article candidates. And I'm curious. Has there ever been an article, you haven't been involved in, you supported straight away? [[User:MacGyverMagic|
[MacGyverMagic]: Thanks, I'll start digging as soon as I can find the time. Please contact me if you remember an article title :-) [[User:MacGyverMagic|
[MacGyverMagic]: And your article '''[[Kaa's Hunting]]''' is now on the Main Page. Enjoy! [[User:MacGyverMagic|
[MacGyverMagic]: Since you accepted the nomination, would you mind answering the candidate questions on Requests for adminship? They will aid users that don't know you in their decision. [[User:MacGyverMagic|
[MacGyverMagic]: Did you track down whoever submitted all those articles to CSD that should've been of VfD? [[User:MacGyverMagic|
[MacGyverMagic]: Also, if you want people to take you seriously, you should sign VFD votes with your own name using 4 tildes.
[MacGyverMagic]: I like the WExCUp idea. It may actually get stuff to the people who can do something about it instead of sitting in a long list for ages. However, my talk often becomes too long, so I'm the first to break your policy for the project. :) I've made a subpage for easier access of my desk queue.
[MacGyverMagic]: I've send you an email telling you about the outline I copied to Wikijunior Ancient Egypt on wikibooks. Shouldn't be too hard to find in my contribution history there. :) Hopefully it'll make for a great magazine topic. :)
[MacGyverMagic]: Don't worry about it. I do understand German myself, but I prefer English or Dutch communication. So you don't need to talk German unless it's easier for yourself.
[MacGyverMagic]: It's not common practice to leave frozen versions in the article namespace and besides \/Temp pages, subpages aren't encouraged either. I've moved the page into your namespace and protected it (it's at [[User:Kils\/Antarctic krill]]), but be advised you won't be able to edit it either. Let me know when it can be unprotected. -
[MacGyverMagic]: I'll go and digest that proposal. Your proposal would take care of a number of lists I consider to be unencyclopedic. But I'm afraid it would also kill [[List of songs with nonsense lyrics]]. It probably needs some perfecting to get wide-spread support, but it's a good start. -
[MacGyverMagic]: I think you can help a lot of people to change their minds if you include her TV work in the article. BTW, thanks for the comment. I'm glad to hear at least someone thinks I've been sensible at some point today. -
[MacGyverMagic]: I think you can help a lot of people to change their minds if you include her TV work in the article. BTW, thanks for the comment. I'm glad to hear at least someone thinks I've been sensible at some point today. -
[MacGyverMagic]: What do you think? -
[MacGyverMagic]: BlueMoose wasn't removing the template. He was using subst: to spare the servers, which is common practice. Also, whether you keep the template or subst: it, makes no difference for the text that appears. I'm happy to unblock, but please don't revert these edits. If you think there's a downside to it, I'm sure BlueMoose would like to hear about it (I do too). -
[MacGyverMagic]: Noisy, BlueMoose has promised he will not try to get the template, deleted and he found the page says it should be subst:'ed. Perhaps, you could agree to seek sanction against BlueMoose if he does try to delete the template after having it subst:'ed and otherwise not? -
[MacGyverMagic]: I've answered your question on the Help desk. -
[MacGyverMagic]: Please consider changing your vote in this discussion. [[Wikipedia:Guide to deletion]] explains how this article needs to redirect to [[freemasonry]] to retain attribution for the merged content. -
[MacGyverMagic]: Thanks! -
[MacGyverMagic]: Please take more care when tagging items for speedy deletion. This was not vanity fiction, but an article about a film in the series called [[The Land Before Time]] produced by [[Steven Spielberg]]'s [[Amblin Entertainment]], which is quite obvious from the Google links. Please make sure you check before tagging something. -
[MacGyverMagic]: Thanks :) -
[MacGyverMagic]: Thanks for translating. However, I'm not yet convinced about his notability. Can you share his bibliography or explain a bit about the poetry award? (Is it a national one, on for only La Palma, was it named after a famous poet?) -
[MacGyverMagic]: Sounds like a notable prize. Please add something about the prize in the article. -
[MacGyverMagic]: A graph from a scientific journal is almost certainly not free and thus not suitable for the Commons. However, if you can make a [[fair use]] claim, you could upload it to the project you want to use it on directly. -
[MacGyverMagic]: I can't think up any examples right now, but good fair use clauses should be easy to find in featured articles. I'll see if I can dig one up for you. -
[MacGyverMagic]: Through the [[goomba]] article, I found [[Wikipedia:Image description page#Fair use rationale]]. Is that of use to you? You can tag articles as {{tl|fair use}}, but the rationale is not something that can be automatically added. The rationale is something that requires human interpretation. -
[MacGyverMagic]: At least we agree on that point then. Perhaps the shell could get a little more detail in a higher resolution. Could you add the reasoning for asking for a higher resolution when you do so next time? That way everyone understands why you're asking and people like myself won't mistake you for a high-res obsessed person. :) I'll go and scrap a few comments now. -
[MacGyverMagic]: I've added a note to the FPC now. -
[MacGyverMagic]: Thank you too for remaining level-headed and civil. Have a flower. -
[MacGyverMagic]: I think this refers to something fictional rather than nonsensical. Could you please let it run through AFD? -
[MacGyverMagic]: Nevermind. I did a Google search and there's no publications in any credible magazines, books or anthologies. It just looks like a crackpot theory he's pushing. -
[MacGyverMagic]: Erm, we seem to have crossed our edits somehow. I received that post of yours After I posted the nevermind thing... I'll put his stuff up for deletion. -
[MacGyverMagic]: Thanks for putting me on the approved list, but why didn't I get a message informing me of this as the page promised? -
[MacGyverMagic]: I have Vandalproof installed and working, but Whodunit gives an error \""can't find article\"" when I try [[Wikipedia:Articles for creation\/Today]] and occasionally with other pages, do I need to put it in the same directory as VandalProof, was it connection problem (My IE browser showed a page, then said it couldn't and shifted to an error page several times last night) or is there some bug I don't know about. Please leave a note on my talk page. -
[MacGyverMagic]: Whodunit is quite useful for tracking down who posted a non-signed submission to [[WP:AFC]]. :) I don't get any errors in the Internet Explorer when using popups. It's only Whodunit that is not getting along. I use quite a lot of my monobook, so wiping it is not an option, if it's a script error, perhaps I need to put a copy of the VP script error patch in the same directory as Whodunit? -
[MacGyverMagic]: Now that the computer with VandalProof and the Query program is connected to the net again, I did some poking. [[Apple]] and [[Wikipedia:Articles for creation]] got results like charm. It was when I added the subpage ([[Wikipedia:Articles for creation\/Today]]) when it returned 'Article not found'. I think it doesn't recognize subpages. Can you remedy this? It would be a great help at AFC and other processes that are prone to receiving unsigned comments (like Ref Desk subpages). -
[MacGyverMagic]: I see you just speedied this. Please remember that hoaxes are not included in CSD G1. I'd put it through AFD and get a quick concensus from comic fans that it's a hoax. At least it was unverifiable. -
[MacGyverMagic]: THanks for protecting that page. I should've done that myself after I saw its deletion history. -
[MacGyverMagic]: I answered at the reference desk. As far as I know sending people or anything else living in the mail (willing or not) is illegal, but you'd have to check with the post office to be sure. We do actually have an article called [[Human mail]], believe it or not. -
[MacGyverMagic]: Are you thinking of sending a Kurt shaped box in the mail and if so, what does that shape look like? On a personal note, I don't recommend UPS, if you do use it, keep some room in the box for food supplies. ;) -
[MacGyverMagic]: There's also a longstanding policy that Wikipedia is not a free webhost. Allowing vanity articles to remain in the userspace when the user in question has no other contributions makes it look like self-promotion is acceptable in the userspace when it's not. Instead of userfying you could also simply post a friendly message to the user who created the article. Result, we've got rid of the article and the user doesn't feel bitten as much. -
[MacGyverMagic]: Oh and if you move something, please use the \""move button\"" at the top of the page , so the edit history of the article stays intact. If you don't have this button yet, just wait a few days until you can, or go to [[Wikipedia:Requested moves]]. -
[MacGyverMagic]: I left a note on his talk page (you can't miss it, it's the name in the [[InterWallet]] history. -
[MacGyverMagic]: I'm not sure what happened, but some signatures of yours look all weird. Do you sign AFD and HD comments with four [[tilde]]s? -
[MacGyverMagic]: That's it. The four tildes already add your username, so you don't have to write it behind the tildes again. -
[MacGyverMagic]: Both [[User:Vary|Vary]] and I seem to think that if the articles are radically shortened and put in a [[list of 10th Kingdom characters]] (per [[WP:FICT]] for lesser important characters), there'd be no need for deletion. I'd even be willing to do the grunt work. Would you please return to the deletion debate and consider changing your vote? -
[MacGyverMagic]: Thank you very much for the quick response. -
[MacGyverMagic]: Can you put me on some sort of list so I'm informed when the Windows version of VandalSniper is ready? Any approximation about the release date? =-
[MacGyverMagic]: There's no need to draw non-responsive anon editors to arbcom. It appears he has never been blocked at all. Bringing this to the attention of an admin (like me) on [[WP:ANI]] or [[WP:AIV]] is probably a better course. I will see how long his edits extend and how many are truly vandalism. I'll report it to the arbcom if I block him (maybe it gets his attention). Arbcom is not for simple vandalism. -
[MacGyverMagic]: I blocked [[User:82.108.12.52|82.108.12.52]] for 48 hours for his vandalistic edits. However, the photographic memory he mentions in connection with Daredevil appears to have some merit. I'm sure you're more qualified than I am on the issue. Please research it and include it in the article if it's not already mentioned. -
[MacGyverMagic]: Tip: If you become admin, just make sure you read the accompanying documentation and take it slowly. Only do controversial stuff when you know you can defend your actions. And if someone points out a mistake, take it graciously and correct yourself. As long as you stay friendly and open, people will forgive the occasional mistake. -
[MacGyverMagic]: I see you're nearing your two-year anniversary. Will you be doing anything special to celebrate? I wonder if I welcomed you on your first day or if it was some time later. -
[MacGyverMagic]: If you remind me of this on the day, I'll send you a present. Do you prefer pets or food? -
[MacGyverMagic]: I came across this AfD you started. Please remember that AfD is for deletions only. If you want something transwikied, please follow the instrunctions at [[Wikipedia:Transwiki]]. -
[MacGyverMagic]: You can submit something that follows DYK rules without an image. There's not even a guarantee the image will be used anyway. Proper licensing is problematic because the original library of congress negative wasn't dated. and since he lived from 1866 to 1952 the photograph could be taken later than 1923 meaning it's not in the public domain by age. If you can't determine the age of the image, your second best option would be to find an image which is certainly old enough to be PD. -
[MacGyverMagic]: Why did you upload that picture to the commons with the username [[commons:User:Carcharoth (Commons)]]? If you use the same name as you do here, without the bracketed modifier, you'll profit from the single user login when it gets implemented. I suggest you request a name change there. -
[MacGyverMagic]: Note, I translated the image description for you. -
[MacGyverMagic]: I'm not a copyright lawyer, but the location of a piece of art (which grafitti appears to fall under) is irrelevant to its copyright status. It doesn't matter if its plastered to a wall, the copyright still belongs to the artist. Nevertheless, seeing as grafitti artists want their work to be seen, they're unlikely to sue and since they're in a public place, nothing keeps you from photographing them legally. -
[MacGyverMagic]: Treat it like any other photograph. Ask permission from whoever did take the photograph. If you get it, you can release it under whatever license you were granted. -
[MacGyverMagic]: How did you come to the conclusion the latter was the more common spelling? -
[MacGyverMagic]: You tagged this as an A& speedy. If you read the article about the author, you'd see it was notable, but since it contained very little text I've redirected the article. If you come across anything similar, redirecting and\/or merging might be a good idea. -
[MacGyverMagic]: In relation to [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Paul_Kirk&diff=115929157&oldid=115894702 this edit], could you point me to the bit of the manual of style that says it should be an n-dash? -
[MacGyverMagic]: No problem. I wanted to know for sure. You're completely correct to do it if the MOS says so. I'll keep it in mind for any other articles. -
[MacGyverMagic]: Woggly, if you're willing to keep an eye in Cymruisrael, I see no reason to keep him from fixing up the article. (I reverted the anon edits before I read your comment here. If I have time I'll see if I can spend some time on fixing this too). -
[MacGyverMagic]: Can you be more specific about what exactly you think establishes the notability of this blog in your comment? It would make your opinion a lot stronger since now it's just two votes of people who make opposite assertions with nothing to back it up. -
[MacGyverMagic]: Bryson says notability is not asserted, you say it is. Without any sort of additional statements, I can't make an informed decision. It doesn't look all that notable to me, but I admit I know nothing about the subject at all, so if you shared your train of thought that would help me a lot. -
[MacGyverMagic]: Please take a look at [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk%3AViolentbob&diff=124324623&oldid=104316414 this]. A missing closing font tag in the welcome template you used caused all the text on the page except links to turn white making them impossible to read unless selected. Please fix this as soon as possible. -
[MacGyverMagic]: I see you tried fixing it, but the fix might cause other problems. If the first thing you do in the message is open a div tag, it should be closed last. You misplaced the font tag in [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABia100&diff=122633497&oldid=60623707 this message]. -
[MacGyverMagic]: I found your template and fixed the order of the tags. -
[MacGyverMagic]: Thanks for protecting this article against vandalism, but I don't think it will help this time around. They'll just wait for the protection to pass at the date you so helpfully provided. Next time, please consider not including that date. -
[MacGyverMagic]: |} <!-- [[{{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}]], [[{{CURRENTYEAR}}]] --> --
[MacGyverMagic]: For some reason this notice ended up with Komusou first. Someone mixed up the attribution and I didn't think to check. Congratulations anyway. :) -
[MacGyverMagic]: {{user|Dihydrogen Monoxide}} pointed me to MelsaranAWB. I'm having trouble finding active editors who can do automated without human confirmation to help me out. Any ideas? I've already posted at Bot requests, but no one commented there yet. -
[MacGyverMagic]: If it's been unsourced for as long as it looks, you're quite right to nominate it. But to give the article a fair chance, could you perhaps contact the relevant video games wikiproject and explain them your concerns. That would give the article more than a fair chance to be referenced. -
[MacGyverMagic]: Often articles can remain untouched for months at a time because the knowledgeable editors don't know there is a problem. If you bring it under their consideration head on, you'll have not just an indication no sources can be found, you'd be absolutely sure of it (and you'd get brownie points from game lovers for making the effort). -
[MacGyverMagic]: Please take a look at my note on the top of the MFD. There is a bot that can use the tags to bring them to the attention of suitable WikiProjects, so I would like to urge you to remove the comment that the template should be deleted as well as the wikipedia: page. -
[MacGyverMagic]: You uploaded this image last summer, but it appears to be a copy from an earlier image uploaded in April. Did you migrate this to the Commons and forget to change the authors name in the template? -
[MacGyverMagic]: Thanks for the note. Could you make sure you mention the page it is a duplicate off next time (in case it is not the same as the one being deleted). Makes me look less of a [[nitwit]] ;) -
[MacGyverMagic]: No problem. You only helped me. I'm quite capable of looking stupid on my own. :) -
[MacGyverMagic]: I see you did quite some editing on Danish film and actor pages. Could I interest you in writing the article [[Emil Odepark]]? It's not exactly Danish, but hey, Swedes are Scandinavian too :) Also, I'm trying to set up an [[User:MacGyverMagic\/Bootcamp|article writing class]]. Interested in helping? -
[MacGyverMagic]: You're right, there's too many trigger-happy people around who'd delete him just for that. (I do think he might have received awards for that, though, can't be sure). Perhaps creating an article on the film would be a better idea then. My idea for the article course would be to take a similar approach to it as [[User:Hersfold]] does with his user adoptions (see [[User:Hersfold\/Adopt|this page]]). Write separate lessons (information interspersed with exercises) to help people along from an idea to a fully-fledged article. I'd start with a lesson on article topic selection, continue with finding and using reliable sources, and through good writing skills and wikicode for templates and infoboxes all the way up to the blingy stuff like sounds, videos and other non-essential stuff to beef it up. Do you have any concrete material from that real-life idea for such a class? -
[MacGyverMagic]: Unfortunately, a lot of people who drop in have self-promotional ideas in mind. But there are quite a few people who are interested in contributing beyond their initial article idea. Suggesting interesting WikiProjects or similar articles that might warrant inclusion are ways to encourage them to stay around. (I agree, encouragement should be a major part of the course) I'm intending to pick up trainees by moving the page to Wikipedia-space once it has been fully developed. -
[MacGyverMagic]: Someone else figured it out. Just make sure you change the author name when you make such a move. :) _
[MacGyverMagic]: See [[Wikipedia:Username#Sharing_accounts]]. -
[MacGyverMagic]: I've blocked the account. Would you like me to move the userpage elsewhere? -
[MacGyverMagic]: Seems pointless to wait for Hersfold. I've deleted the page and I'll leave a note to hersfold about it. Unless you intend to use the logo, please tag it for deletion on the Commons. -
[MacGyverMagic]: The current version is indeed a copyvio. Do you want to have a go at fixing it? If not, I'm afraid I'll have to vote for deletion, or speedy delete the article when I come home in an hour or 2. -
[MacGyverMagic]: I don't oppose articles on obscure festivals, but I'm pretty sure someone is going to complain because all the sources are closely related to the event. Can you dig up any references from papers or magazine or websites outside the town of Alfred? I tried, but the only thing I could find was a whole bunch of references to National Hot Dog Day and other events by the same name. -
[MacGyverMagic]: [[User:Somno]] added some references to the article. Since the fact this was exhibited on the World Fair is now referenced, I'd like to ask you to consider withdrawing your nomination. -

[MacGyverMagic]: |style=\""vertical-align: middle; border-top: 1px solid gray;\"" | I hereby award you a barnstar for saving [[Road Island Diner]] from deletion and offering a confuddled newbie additional help.
[MacGyverMagic]: No problem. I already closed it. -
[MacGyverMagic]: No problem. I already closed it. -
[MacGyverMagic]: What happened? Did you forget to look for sources to see if this was salvagable or did you somehow fail to find them yourself? (I totally understand if it was a mistake, in the heat of patrolling, I've made them myself) The user who wrote the article appears to be a newbie and if a newbie manages to put together a coherent text that includes a notability claim like the one about the [[World Fair]], my first move would be to ask them to reference it, rather than going straight to Afd. -

[MacGyverMagic]: I don't want to be mean, but I think [[Rod Machado]] is a similar article. You did properly search Google, but I think you forgot Google Books. If you take out his own books, there's quite a few unrelated books there that can back up claims that I believe to make him notable. -

[MacGyverMagic]: Can you dig up relevant references or write a draft in userspace? I think either would help the DRV case. If John254 is blatantly wrong, then redirecting the page would merely promote the opposite viewpoint (be it a more prevalent one). Having a scientifically supported article at the location would avoid any bickering about where it should redirect to. -
[MacGyverMagic]: Could you please add inline references to the rest of this article? I'd love to propose it for [[Wikipedia:Did you know?]]. Let me know once you've done so (within 5 days to meet the DYK guidelines) and I'll be happy to follow through on my promise. -
[MacGyverMagic]: You've been around long enough. I'm assuming you know deletes and merges don't mix well. Your nomination here seems to indicate something might have been salvagable. Why did you nom for deletion rather than trying a merge first? -
[MacGyverMagic]: The average Wikipedian who comments on an AFD doesn't know much more than you do. I would've tried to merge and see if it sticked. Or, alternatively, make the suggestion to the people who wrote the article on Lilly. -
[MacGyverMagic]: If you have the permission to reveal its contents, hosting it would be a good idea. That way the information is also available to other editors. You still need OTRS to confirm it's indeed the transcript of an actual email conversation (and if possible proof of who the participants are if the addresses don't make it clear) -
[MacGyverMagic]: I've temporarily undeleted this, so people can review the article. -
[MacGyverMagic]: Your explanation is faulty, the editor asking for deletion doesn't only need to be the principle editor of the page, there's an additional provision that there shouldn't be any significant edits by anyone else. (This to prevent people from requesting deletion of everything they wrote if they decide to throw a tantrum and leave) If anyone else edited a page in some significant way, then the page has potential and shouldn't go despite the wishes of the original creator unless flawed in some other unsalvagable way. -
[MacGyverMagic]: Quick note: This is not a speedy for copyright violation. Nationmaster is one of the sites who copy Wikipedia rather than the other way around. _
[MacGyverMagic]: The GA review is up for your perusal. Please leave me a note on my talk page in a fresh section if you need to draw my attention. -
[MacGyverMagic]: I've commented on the review again. Congratulations on a job the particularly well done when it comes to the images. Do you know if any of the book sources are on Google Books? It would be nothing new, but it would help the reader who can't access the paper versions of the books.  -
[MacGyverMagic]: Several people have complained about your splitting of articles. Please read [[Wikipedia:Splitting]] and follow the proper procedure. Discuss things before you do it and make sure you leave an adequate summary in the parent article as well as the link pointing to the split content. -
[MacGyverMagic]: The way it was written suggested someone else stated that Neal was right about Poe turning out to be a great poet. The claim of Neal you quoted said that Poe might \""make a beautiful and perhaps a magnificent poem\"" If you meant to say Poe wrote such a poem to prove he was right about American poetry, it needs a rewrite to clarify that. Anyway, while important, it's not a point to stop the nomination on. I've promoted the article. -
[MacGyverMagic]: I'm not sure you know this, so I'm sending you a quick note about it. I've come across to AFDs you closed and you forgot to put the header inside the closure tags in both cases. I know that at least one of the TFD or CFD processes do it differently, which might be causing the confusion. Maybe something to remember for your next closure. -
[MacGyverMagic]: Are you aware that the closing admin first closed the debate as a redirect (most likely to point readers in the right direction) and later deleted that redirect in defiance of his own closure before finally userfying the article history? -
[MacGyverMagic]: I''ll take another look. -
[MacGyverMagic]: Did you try to alter the filter? If you did, you probably were just unlucky. I was not aware you tried to change anything. If you do change something please let me know what it is so I can see its effect on the log. -

[MacGyverMagic]: Yes, I was particularly fond of the show when I had to pick an online [[pseudonym]]. It's stuck ever since, even though I haven't seen any reruns of the show for at least 3 years. -
[MacGyverMagic]: Apparently, you accidentally used a non-free image instead of the icons listed on the page which caused [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Template_talk%3ADid_you_know&diff=282509868&oldid=282509737 Cydebot to insert a whole bunch of rationale templates].

[MacGyverMagic]: On [[T:TDYK]] you said someone who knows about [[WP:BLP]] and minors should look at the article. If you take a look at the new articles (and especially the DYKs) I contributed, you'll find that writing about minors has become a sort of specialization of me and I have yet to come across any serious BLP problems. Is there anything I can do that could convince you to take a look at the entry yourself? Is there any particular content you thought might be a BLP violation? =-
[MacGyverMagic]: It was all an honest bit of harmless fun, but even if I cited and linked the original episode, it would require original research to get that. I could take out the explanation and have the reader guess the reason (in the article), or we could simply use a different hook (the song raised 1 million euros for charity). -
[MacGyverMagic]: Notable or not, an article has certain minimum requirements, verifiability and sources independent from the subject are one of those. If it can't be deleted per A7, then those other reasons should be sufficient. Also, if something is highly controversial, then keeping it outright is just as bad an idea as speedy deleting it. The exception for schools is a recent addition to the A7 criterion and did not receive any sort of consensus so it shouldn't be there. [[WP:ORG]] has widespread consensus and does apply. -
[MacGyverMagic]: P.S. I've done some spelling fixes on the message on your main userpage. If these mistakes were intentional, please feel free to revert them. -
[MacGyverMagic]: Please clarify something at the FFD. The source link doesn't actually link to the map, or any unedited version of it. Also, if the ellipses show boundaries, it has to be based on some sort of source. Unless you can show what they're based on I have to agree with the nominator that it is original research. -
[MacGyverMagic]: The source definitely helps, but notability is usually established by multiple reliable sources (as this seems to be). You could try contacting the journalist to see if she dug anything up to add to the interviews. -
[MacGyverMagic]: Congratulations on a very interesting DYK item. I never expected something like that to actually be true :) -"

[JD554]: Fair enough, that was a template I didn't know about. --
[JD554]: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Depeche_Mode_discography&diff=216607062&oldid=216597871 Can ... worms ... everywhere!] --
[JD554]: Although I doubt it's noteworthiness, I think BurningZeppelin will have been referring to [http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/Presspass\/press\/2008\/jun08\/06-04JoyDivisionPR.mspx this]. --
[JD554]: It truly is appalling, as are the other bonus tracks on the 2003 reissue (with the exception [http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=sAP7B8ltO5M&feature=related Never Stop]). I'm not sure why record companies insist on using early versions as bonus tracks \u2013 if they were any good they'd have been on the original \u2013 rare b-sides, live tracks etc fair enough, but early versions suck.--
[JD554]: Which proves my point, they're live versions from the ''Life at Brian's'' and ''Crystal Days'' sessions and \""Angels and Devils\"" was a b-side. --
[JD554]: Thanks, will do --
[JD554]: Freekily enough I just started reading it this morning. I was going to read the Bunnymen bits first but I'm not sure if I want to spoil the ending ;-) --
[JD554]: Yeah it's the British version. I'm still reading the prologue at the moment but I'll get past that on the train on my way home tonight (commuting has it's uses) --
[JD554]: I did think about skipping it and going straight on to the grey album, but I do like a challenge ;-) There does seem to be plenty about the album in various sources (Adams, reviews, etc) so I should be able to get something half decent done. I also think it is quite a significant album for the EATB given the time between ''Ocean Rain'' and the grey album, it being the \""parent\"" album for \""Bring On the Dancing Horses\"" and the fact it was expanded and reissued as ''More Songs...'' (which I think is probably more of a reissue than a new album). But having said all that I'll probably work on the grey album at the same time to be on the safe side! --
[JD554]: I've found at least one GA precedent for a compilation album - [[Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 1994\u20132000]] --
[JD554]: I'm pleased that you think [[The Smiths discography]] is worthy of being A-Class, but according to [[Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team\/Assessment\/A-Class criteria]] it needs to be agreed by one other project member with a review on the talk page. Nothing ever seems to be straightforward around here. --
[JD554]: Fine with me ;-) --
[JD554]: Good question. And the short answer is no. I took the compilations from [http:\/\/www.passionsjustlikemine.com\/disc\/smiths-dcomp.htm here], but I've just had a look on discogs.com and found a missing Peel Sessions 12\""\/CD EP. I'll add this but it will knock out the ''Best of the Peel Session'' compilation (which I've also just found at discogs) as not being a unique release. I'll have a good look at what else is on discogs and there may be some more to add. --
[JD554]: I've added the chart positions to [[Disintegration (album)|Disintegration]] in table format due to the number of charts. Hope that's okay --
[JD554]: Yep definitely #10: I've changed the source for you. --
[JD554]: I'd give it a go, but I don't have really have much info on The Smiths - I managed to get the discography done mainly by luck with what I found on the internet. copyediting etc I should be able to help with though. --
[JD554]: No I hadn't come across that yet. Thanks for the tip, should be very useful! --
[JD554]: Oops, forgot about Joy Division being outside the scope of the project, sorry. I still remember it all meaning pretty much the same thing at the time: the lines between post-punk, indie and alternative were very blurred back then. I must try to remember the revisionist history ;-) --
[JD554]: History!? This is my youth we're talking about here you young whipper-snapper. (Suddenly feeling old) --
[JD554]: No problem regards The Smiths chart positions. Regarding Bunnymen articles, I think I just got a bit \""bunneymen-ed out\"" having done a few in a shortish space of time. I'm just doing a bit of new-page patrolling and wikignoming until I get my mojo back - hopefully shouldn't be too long. Cheers --
[JD554]: Hi, I've been having a look at the Chart position section for [[Nevermind]]. I can't confirm all the chart positions that are on the page there (and in fact some appear to be wrong). The trouble I'm having is finding out what year the release peaked as the album was released late in 1991 but the claim is that some of the peak positions are in 1992. I'm sure that's correct, it's just the sources from [[Nirvana discography]] don't confirm it, they simply give the year of release. Any ideas? --
[JD554]: I'm on holiday for a couple of weeks after today, but I'll give a hand mid-Septemberish if it still needs it. Cheers --
[JD554]: I did see that request for help, I see you've already made a fair amount of progress on what should be left out. I think I should be able to help out. What do they need for this, a diff of the best recent version of an article? Let me know which ones need looking at (assuming the remaining candidates are split between whoever's helping out). Cheers --
[JD554]: No problem, I can get that done today sometime. --
[JD554]: [[Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness]] charts updated and citations added. I've also updated the sales certs table. Don't ever worry about asking me to help out like this, I think it's fair to say you've probably done more for the alt-rock wikiproject than the rest of us put together. Cheers --
[JD554]: I remember you were involved with [[Siouxsie & the Banshees]] article when Carliertwo kept trying to remove an image of Siouxsie without consensus. You might be interested in the discussion at [[Talk:Siouxsie_%26_the_Banshees#A_editorial_problem__.2F_The_1986_picture]]. --
[JD554]: Echo & the Bunnymen could certainly do with some work, but I believe McCulloch has an autobiography due out sometime in the New Year that I was going to wait for. In McCulloch's own self-deprecating way he has said it will be \""better than the bible\"". Having just got [[List of awards and nominations received by David Bowie]] to FL, I'm trying to get [[David Bowie discography]] up there, which is a far larger task than I originally thought it would be! But I'll gladly help out on ''Unknown Pleasures''. I don't have too many sources for it: The charts I can certainly help get sorted, but apart from that I've only got access to a Melody Maker review from July 79, a Factory Records overview by Mary Harron (who clearly doesn't like the album) in September 79 and a Joy Division retrospective from July 94's Mojo which has some useful info on the album. --
[JD554]: Yeah, I've got the UK version of ''Touching From a Distance'' at home. I'll have scan through it tonight to see what's mentioned about the album. The '79 Factory article is on rocksbackpages at http:\/\/www.rocksbackpages.com\/article.html?ArticleID=12992. I've not had a read through yet so don't know if it'll be of any use. --
[JD554]: I'm not sure ''The band initially disliked the \""spacious, atmospheric sound\"" of the album, which did not reflect their more aggressive live sound.'' from [[Joy Division]] is right. Reading the booklet from the 2007 remastered CD and ''Touching from a Distance'' it seems the band were split 50\/50 with Hook (although he later changed his mind) and Barney not liking it and Curtis and Morris liking it. So I'll stick with a 50\/50 split for the album article but [[Joy Division]] might need tweaking. Also, do you have a reliable source that would back up what I've written in the first paragraph of the Releases section? I'm pretty sure that's how it went and I can find some fan websites that back it up, but nothing reliable. --
[JD554]: Hmm, there's a few. I would have to say for that for all their early popularity (this side of the pond too) I never \""got\"" [[Associates (duo)|The Associates]]. But [[:Category:New Wave groups]] throws up a few names that still make me shiver, [[Kajagoogoo]], [[The Knack]] (one that the US gave back to us!), [[A Flock of Seagulls]] and [[Haysi Fantayzee]] to name just a few. Another I never \""got\"" was [[Scritti Politti]]. But the biggest disappointment, for all his solo success, [[Feargal Sharkey]] ... what was he thinking? --
[JD554]: Psychedelic Furs almost totally passed me by, not deliberately, it's just I have no recollection of hearing anything by them until the 86 version of \""Pretty in Pink\"" (which I had no idea was re-recorded) and I never checked out their back catalogue. I liked \""Pretty in Pink\"" at first, but it was (and is still is) played to death. A shocking hole in my listening history (just one of many I suspect) that I should rectify. --
[JD554]: Yes indeed, although I don't have anything by them apart from what's on compilations; inevitably \""Rip It Up\"", but I think I might have \""Felicity\"" and \""L O V E ... Love\"" somewhere. XTC are another band worthy of a listen: ''Go 2'' and ''Drums and Wires'' I've got, but I should get ''Black Sea'' and ''English Settlement'' if only for \""Generals and Majors\"" and \""Senses Working Overtime\"". --
[JD554]: I'll keep an open mind and check out that YouTube link tonight at home (YouTube's blocked at work). --
[JD554]: Thanks, I'll see if I can get a copy too. Talking of Mojo they have an interview with Kim Gordon about her paintings [http:\/\/www.mojo4music.com\/blog\/2007\/11\/beauty_lies_in_the_eye_of_kim.html here]. --
[JD554]: Nope, your Scritti Politti link left me cold. But I'll raise you a gloriously [http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fGkrkcoTILc batty man] --
[JD554]: Finally got the chart references in for [[Morrissey]]. I tried yesterday but got an edit conflict with TheColdDick and the same again today. It looks like he just added the same as yesterday so I simply reverted him, hope that's OK. --
[JD554]: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Morrissey&diff=252789380&oldid=252787752 *sigh*] --
[JD554]: [[In Utero]] charts done. --
[JD554]: Hi, I noticed that you changed the release date of [[Seventeen Seconds]] from 22 April 1980 to May 1980 as that is what Allmusic has the release date as. I've reverted your change as The Cure's official website as the release date as 22 April 1980[http:\/\/www.thecure.com\/discography\/albums.aspx\/pid\/1424]. I suspect that the Allmusic date may be the US release date. Cheers, --
[JD554]: Thanks for the nice words re the Echo & the Bunnymen articles. From seeing the depth of information in some FA-class album articles, I don't think I've got the sources needed to take them to FAC. I'm going to get back to working on the rest of their studio albums soon though, I just needed a break from all things \""bunny\"" for a while and, being a sad \""statto\"", I've enjoyed working on lists and chart positions in the meantime. Cheers, --
[JD554]: Went to see [[Ocean_Rain#Ocean_Rain_tour|this]] in Liverpool last week, I was a bit worred as I know Mac has a habit of crooning even more than he used to, but the worries were unfounded, they were awesome. --
[JD554]: Tried both those suggestions with no luck. I guess I'll have to leave them blank for the time-being. Cheers anyway, --
[JD554]: Thanks, I'll keep an eye out for that. --
[JD554]: Hopefully I've addressed your points at The Cure discography [[Wikipedia:Featured list candidates\/The Cure discography|FLC]]. Let me know if there's anything else. BTW, I should get around to those chart references sometime today\/tomorrow. Cheers, --
[JD554]: \""[[Heart-Shaped Box]]\"" done. --
[JD554]: \""[[All Apologies]]\"" done now too. --
[JD554]: If I had to hazard a guess I would say the beer! ... although probably ''Control''. JMC seem to be just another group to jump on the nostalgia bandwagon and I really can't imagine their gigs are anything like their infamous '80s ones. Missed it when it came out but I'm hoping to get ''Control'' on DVD for Christmas (as long as my Mrs has picked on my no-so-subtle hinting). --
[JD554]: I subscribe too, there's plenty in there Bunny related that I'll get around to using. Thanks anyway, --

[JD554]: You removed content by removing the two charts for Netherlands (which are both well cited). You also added the Canadian Hot 100 but it is not cited. Not all the charts are called ''Billboard'' xxx as you can see by following the following links: [[Hot Adult Top 40 Tracks]] and [[Hot Modern Rock Tracks]]. As you can see, they are produced by ''Billboard'' but it isn't part of the charts' names. Also adding <nowiki>{{sort|US|U.S.}}<\/nowiki> doesn't produce a link but allows the sorting to working properly by ignoring the dot. So, I will remove the Canadian chart as it is uncited and therefore violates Wikipedia's policy on [[WP:V]] and I will restore the charts for the Netherlands which are well cited. I will also remove ''Billboard'' from the chart names where it doesn't belong. I really don't see the point in having the Pop 100 and Hot Dance Club Play charts as they are only minor charts compared to the Hot 100 and Hot Modern Rock Tracks, but I'll concede to leave these in providing you don't remove well cited information. Doing so, is a violation of Wikipedia's policies and may result in your account being blocked. --

[JD554]: I've withdrawn the nom. I noticed that another editor had uploaded a copyrighted image over the top of yours. I've reverted to your version. --
[JD554]: Yeah, I noticed you buggered about with my references ;-p But it is looking good, a cinch for GA and can't be far off FA. I've never heard the whole album (just ''MTV Unplugged'' tracks: \""Dumb\"", \""Pennyroyal Tea\"" and \""Apologies\"" I think). It's a while since I listened to any Nirvana, I need to fix that. --
[JD554]: True fact #2: Ian McCulloch signed Glasvegas up as support for the recent Ocean Rain gig in Liverpool, telling people they were the best band since Nirvana. Personally, I think Glasvegas are in danger of becoming one-trick-ponies. --
[JD554]: \""[[Geraldine (song)|Geraldine]]\"" is their stand-out song for me - very Phil Spector. --
[JD554]: Yeah, I think you're right. It's a bit dubious having an NFC image of an old version of the band. Hope you had a good Christmas, --
[JD554]: How about [[Badly Drawn Boy]]'s ''[[Have You Fed the Fish?]]'' An excellent album for Sunday morning listening\u2014an often overlooked concept by most bands in this genre. --
[JD554]: As requested I've had a look at [[Mother's Milk]]. Along with the bit of copy editing, I removed the chart history section as this was given in prose anyway in the 'Promotion, release and reception' section and was just duplication. I'm struggling to understand what the last sentence of the first paragraph in the 'Background' section is trying to say. Also the bit that mentions Keidis' past drug use will need a citation per [[WP:BLP]]. Hope this helps, --
[JD554]: No problem. I may have a crack at getting [[Ocean Rain]] to FA at some point, I just need to lay my hands on a couple of more sources to flesh it out, and then I'll call in that favour. Cheers,  --
[JD554]: I'd agree with that, although I'd say that ''Heaven Up Here'' > ''Porcupine'' too. Hope you have a Happy New Year, --
[JD554]: I'll have to let you know later whether I should be smiling or frowning as bloody Youtube's blocked where I am at the moment :-( --
[JD554]: Ah, that would be [[Human (song)|this one]] then? A band definitely passed their peak by that time. --
[JD554]: I agree. It's strange how similar drum machine sounds can either sound dated or fit. Sacraligious as it may be, but I think the drum machine on \""Blue Monday\"" sounds dated now, but a similar sound on just about any [[Red Lorry Yellow Lorry]] song seems to fit. I don't analyse these things too closely but I guess it's to do with the overall sound of the song. --
[JD554]: Not really, but I'll look that up tonight (always prepared to be educated). --
[JD554]: I've not been able to get the bloody tune out of my head all day. I blame you, I really do! --
[JD554]: Bono? Hmm, I guess a bit, especially on \""Go Square Go\"". Have you spotted the cringeworthy lyrics yet? --
[JD554]: And as random statements go, that's a pretty good one. --
[JD554]: Could you give [[Reverberation (album)]] a quick copyedit before I take it to GAN? I'm a little unhappy about the balance between the three prose sections, but not sure how to handle it (there's bugger all info on the recording and music available). Thanks, --
[JD554]: Cheers, you're a star. It looks a lot better. --
[JD554]: [[Talk:Echo & the Bunnymen (album)\/GA1|Am I being unfair?]] --
[JD554]: Picked up a [[Zavvi|cheap]] copy of the ''[[First and Last and Always]]'' CD yesterday as I haven't listened to the album for years. When I listened to it I was struck by the similarity of the music with the first two Bunnymen albums (ignoring Eldritch's and McCulloch's singing): particularly Gary Marx\/Will Sergeant's guitar and the Dr Avalanche\/de Freitas's drumming. I was bit surprised by that. --
[JD554]: I preferred ''The Reptile House EP'', but the release of ''First and Last and Always'' was the beginning of their downward spiral. Thankfully the early singles and EPs are compiled on ''Some Girls Wander By Mistake''. --
[JD554]: I suspect the somewhat predictable answer for me would be ''War'', although ''The Joshua Tree'' would be a close second. I really went off their stuff from ''Achtung Baby'' onwards (although I haven't heard much I can remember from the last two albums). I quite like the new album cover, my first thought when seeing was \""ooh post-punk\"". It seems reminiscent of Joy Division\/New Order covers. But it's the music that counts and I'll reserve judgment on that for the time-being. --
[JD554]: Ian McCulloch gives the (probably apocryphal) story[http:\/\/entertainment.timesonline.co.uk\/tol\/arts_and_entertainment\/music\/article4914657.ece] about when U2 were supporting The Bunnymen in the early days that Bono thanked the audience during the sound-check. --
[JD554]: They did indeed. British papers (particularly at weekends) quite often give away old CDs or DVDs as promotional items with every copy. We have about 9 or 10 national papers compared to most American markets which only have 1 or 2. --
[JD554]: Prince even gave away his most recent album free with the [http:\/\/www.mailonsunday.co.uk\/home\/moslive\/article-466634\/New-Prince-album-FREE-inside-weekends-Mail-Sunday.html Mail on Sunday] newspaper. But mostly it seems to be DVDs of old films at the moment. --
[JD554]: Hmm, I had AGF'd those references which now looks like it was a mistake: The New Zealand (two Scapolo references) chart positions are different [http:\/\/charts.org.nz\/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Nirvana here], the Australian (Kent) chart positions are the same [http:\/\/australian-charts.com\/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Nirvana here] (but no position for \""All Apologies\""), the Belgian position (Colin) can't be confirmed [http:\/\/www.ultratop.be\/nl\/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Nirvana here] and the Finnish position (Pennanen) can't be confirmed [http:\/\/finnishcharts.com\/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Nirvana here] either. I think it's probably best to go with the website positions as we can immediately confirm these rather than trying to track someone with the books to confirm the positions and page numbers. It may be Friday before I can make these changes though as I'm on a course at the moment. --
[JD554]: Sounds like a good plan. The Joy Division albums certainly deserve to be better the start class. --
[JD554]: I think a lot of editors tend to stick with their own little projects for their main contributions (like me with Bunnymen stuff). But, yeah, you would think more would be interested working on Joy Division related articles, especially when you see how popular the band's article is[http:\/\/stats.grok.se\/en\/200901\/Joy%20Division]. --
[JD554]: Looking back at ''In Utero'', you started to edit it heavily in July 2007, but viewing stats don't go back that far. So picking December 2007 the average number of views per day was 1.4 thousand[http:\/\/stats.grok.se\/en\/200712\/In_Utero]. They've now gone up by more than a third to 1.9 thousand views per day[http:\/\/stats.grok.se\/en\/200901\/In%20Utero]. That tells you that readers appreciate it and [[User:WesleyDodds#Awards|this]] tells you that other editors do too. --
[JD554]: Hi, I've just expanded [[Evergreen (album)]]. Would you be able to give it a copyedit before I take it to GAN? --
[JD554]: Cheers --
[JD554]: Do you know, I don't even like The Killers' \""Human\"" either. --
[JD554]: I can't say I've ever noticed. \""Laid\"" is their best, but I'm quite partial to \""Hymn from a Village\"" and \""Tomorrow\"" as well. --
[JD554]: Just noticed your [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:JD554&diff=prev&oldid=267163288 edit summary]: hah! yes, but with more style --
[JD554]: People who say they like ''Metal Machine Music'' can't possibly realise what they're saying. --
[JD554]: Yep, I was listening to ''Transformer'' this morning ... classic. --
[JD554]: Ooh, quite a varied and eclectic lot: I'm partial to the blues as a whole, but in particular John Lee Hooker, BB King, Muddy Waters and most of the original electric bluesmen. I also quite like very early rock 'n' roll, Elvis's Sun recordings are outstanding, Carl Perkins, Eddie Cochrane, Jerry Lee Lewis et al (although I can't stand the wishy-washy stuff we Brits made). Then there's Motown\/Atlantic\/Stax-Volt\/Northern soul. Then the proto-punks: Velvet Undergound\/Lou Reed, Iggy Pop, Patti Smith etc. And just lately I've begun listening to Johnny Cash; ''At Folsom Prison'' is an extraordinary album, but I think ''At San Quentin'' just pips it for me. I also like some of early 20th century classical stuff by Aaron Copland, Vaughan Williams, Holst etc. I'm sure there must be loads I've missed. And you? --
[JD554]: As far as the blues goes you should check out <s>[[Albert Collins]]<\/s> [[Albert King]] - he primarily recorded during the 60s\/70s and it's easy to see how he influenced (and was in turn influenced by) bands like Led Zep. He would make a good bridge to the earlier electric guitar blues greats like BB King. --
[JD554]: Oops, wrong Albert, although Collins isn't bad either. --
[JD554]: Maybe it's something that comes with age. I only started to appreciate the blues from my mid-30s onwards. A bit like olives really :-) --
[JD554]: [[Erick Purkhiser|This is a real shame]]. --
[JD554]: Hopefully it will be soon, I've put a {{tl|db-move}} on [[Lux Interior]]. You lost me with the Bowie\/Elton John reference I'm afraid. --
[JD554]: Of course! --
[JD554]: I'm stunned that no-one has taken ''Pet Sounds'' beyond B-class or ''Horses'' beyond C. --
[JD554]: It must be an age thing. I guess the silver-haired surfers I keep reading about haven't found Wikipedia yet. --
[JD554]: <s>Regarding the ''In Utero'' FAC: dashes are one of the \""Allowable changes\"" in quotations per [[MOS:QUOTE]].<\/s> --
[JD554]: I'm cracking up, I could've sworn I saw something about dashes. --
[JD554]: Careful, you're beginning to sound like a further eduction teacher. Got any elbow patches? --
[JD554]: Can't get YouTube, is that [http:\/\/profile.myspace.com\/silverrocketclub this lot]? If so, not too bad. I suppose it was only a matter of time before a post-punk revival band sounded like The Fall - track 2 anyway, track 3 sounds like Green Day (that's not a compliment). --
[JD554]: I'll check that out tonight and let you know. --
[JD554]: It's like they can't make their minds up what the song should sound like ... it has too many different sounds\/textures. --
[JD554]: I randomly found [http:\/\/profile.myspace.com\/theverythings this], I'd completely forgotten I had their LP ''The Bushes Scream''. What do you think of the song \""The Bushes Scream While My Daddy Prunes\""? The early 80s were great. --
[JD554]: Yeah, I bought it the other day. I've not read it yet, but one thing I've noticed is that there's not date for each of the interviews, so it's difficult to tell if they're old or new. --
[JD554]: Could be. Bizarrely he finishes with an interview with himself. I'm particularly looking forward to the Anthony H Wilson, Bill Drummond, Andy Gill, John Peel and Steven Morris interviews. --
[JD554]: ! Nah, it's got to be \""Kings of the Wild Frontier\"". --
[JD554]: Hmm, tricky one. There really is only a couple of proper love songs that they've done well - McCulloch's problem is that he tends to descend to crooning too much. \""Killing Moon\"" is obviously the best, but maybe the only other one that's any good is \""Nothing Lasts Forever\"". --
[JD554]: Why does Morrissey keep getting good reviews for releasing the same song time after time? --
[JD554]: The shirt? It's wrong on so many levels. --
[JD554]: <nowiki>*ahem*<\/nowiki> Those where '[[List_of_British_words_not_widely_used_in_the_United_States#C|crisps]]' I'll have you know my good man. --
[JD554]: You'd hardly guess by your editing times ;-) --
[JD554]: I've added the fact the 1980 reissue got to #1 on the [[UK Indie Chart]], but that's all there is. The album doesn't appear to have charted anywhere else. --
[JD554]: No problem, but it'll be Monday before I get my print sources back. --
[JD554]: Hmm, can't say I've noticed, I'll give it a listen tonight. Any particular R.E.M. era in mind? --
[JD554]: Sure I'll give it a go. --
[JD554]: I've not seen it yet. I try to keep an open mind and make my own conclusions, but it's very difficult to from the descriptions I've seen. But I know for sure there is one aspect of it I won't like ... the song. --
[JD554]: I've finished the recording section at [[User:Ceoil\/Unknown]]. Can you check what I've added with the information from Ott about the toilet etc - I don't have access to the source. Also I've noticed that that ''Morrissey and the Story of Manchester'' Mojo classic (used in the music section to say the band weren't happy) seems to disagree with Morris in the re-release Cd-liner (saying he was happy) and ''Touching from a Distance'' which says Curtis \""enthused\"" no less (both of which I used in the recording section). --
[JD554]: Yeah, the liner notes definitely agree that Hook and Sumner didn't like it - just not sure about all four of them. --
[JD554]: Good point, I'll check that out. --
[JD554]: The way Hot Chocolate should have sung it[http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PCzgOwrHedg&feature=related] --
[JD554]: No, the majority of pop\/soul\/r&b from the late 70s onwards doesn't do much for me. I can recognise a half-decent tune, which the majority of Princes' seemed to be, but it's not my cup of tea. --
[JD554]: I've always wondered why De Freitas grew that god awful beard. It makes him look like a younger version of [[David Bellamy]] (a famous naturalist over here). --
[JD554]: I'm not sure about these days, but when I served in the late 80s it wasn't that unusual, there would always be a group into punk\/post-punk\/indie who would stick together. They used to hate us in the [[NAAFI]] as we'd take our own records on disco nights and take over. The RAF has always been thought of as the least military of the three branches so maybe that accounts for it. --
[JD554]: Almost as good as \""[[The Eton Rifles|Eat Two Trifles]]\"". I was going to say that Weller has never been as good since, but that'd be plain wrong - he's done some very good stuff as the \""modfather\"", but The Jam had the right sound for the time. --
[JD554]: Like the NME collectables? I wouldn't go as far to say that I love them, but they are useful for putting reviews in one place. --
[JD554]: Yeah, I've heard of those, but I've never come across any. Is there a website or something that gives a list of the one's that have been produced? --
[JD554]: Looking on Omnibus Press's site and can't see any, so I guess you're right they are out of print. They've got plenty in the \""Complete Guide to Their Music\"" series - do you know if they're any good generally? --
[JD554]: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJD554&diff=271533562&oldid=271283883 *Ahem*] :-P --
[JD554]: I commend laziness but not cleaning. I'm just working on the background section, so hopefully we shouldn't be too far off unleashing it. --
[JD554]: I've not given it a thorough read, but the main sections look OK on the whole (I'll have a thorough read later today). The lead looks a bit short though, any chance of expanding it with something from the 'Music' section? --
[JD554]: I don't need YouTube to picture that mullet - I've been traumatised ever since. --
[JD554]: Heck, ''I'' don't like the band cause of ''his'' haircut in the 80s (I think he's trying to shift the blame there). Luckily for them I like some of their music. --
[JD554]: Your not going to be tidying your apartment that much are you!? --
[JD554]: I find the best solution for stress is copious amounts of alcohol. You then find nothing is quite as bad as the hangover from hell. --
[JD554]: You don't drink? That's a shame, American brewers are beginning to get the knack of what beer should taste like now as well, or even to realise that is should taste at all. I've noticed The Beatles discog before, it really is bad. Now I've done a few of the more simple discograpies, I want to try one that's a [[David Bowie discography|bit more complicated]]. I even started that one [[User:JD554\/Sandbox4|here]], but the compilations are a nightmare. If I can get that one right I might attempt The Beatles'. --
[JD554]: Sheesh, no beer, no Bowie - if I didn't know [[Joy Division|better]] I'd be beginning to suspect your taste :-p --
[JD554]: As long as it's not [[Run Fatboy Run|this]] Simon Pegg you'll do OK. --
[JD554]: The trouble with Run Fatboy Run is that is has Hank Azaria in it - the only decent things he's done is The Simpsons and Mystery Men. Hmm, sources ... I've only got a couple of Bunnymen albums to get to GA and then I'm going to try and see if I can get Ocean Rain to FA, but I really could do with seeing what Tony Fletcher's ''Never Stop: The Echo & The Bunnymen Story'' has to say about it. Unfortunately it's out of print and my local library doesn't have it.--
[JD554]: That's a shame, online prices are [http:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/gp\/offer-listing\/0711911215\/ref=dp_olp_used?ie=UTF8&qid=1236601861&sr=1-1&condition=used bit steep] for a second hand book - \xa3108!?! If I think of anything else I'll let you know. --
[JD554]: Now I can't even access them at home![http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/technology\/7933565.stm] --
[JD554]: Although YouTube say it isn't, I suspect it's a negotiating tactic. But it's damned inconvenient in the meantime. --
[JD554]: No problem with the charts. As for compilation videos, buying anything at the moment will have to wait as I wrote my car off last week (totalled) :(  --
[JD554]: Just started after an ec. I've updated the existing US and UK references, now I'll begin hunting down the foreign charts and I should just be sticking to the charts section for the time being. --
[JD554]: Sounds good to me - I don't particularly like having a table for singles in an album's article anyway, a brief summary should do. --
[JD554]: What do you think about the inclusion (or not) of the New Zealand and French chart positions? Having slept on it I'm not sure that either of them are really representative of the success the album achieved on various charts around the world and also charted quite a bit later than the majority. But then again would it be neutral to exclude them? --
[JD554]: Ah, crossed wires. I meant the NZ and French charts that are there now in the Charts section. If we lose them we'll be bang on the recommended 10. --
[JD554]: Yeah, it is quite surprising. But it wasn't until ''Young Americans'' when he started to make it in America. But given the length of time the majority of his albums have been on sale, I would've expected higher certifications. Does the average record buyer over their not investigate back catalogues maybe? --
[JD554]: That could be it then, he left both RCA and EMI on bad terms, so maybe in a fit of pique they just haven't bothered. --
[JD554]: That was an interesting read. I wonder, after reading that, if one of Bowie's problems over there is that he hasn't been consistent in any one genre, or even closely related genres. He started with what could, at best, be described as mediocre pop\/rock\/folk, then came the glam period (which apart from Elton John's MOR interpretation of it was largely ignored in the States), he began to get popular over there with his take of soul\/funk with ''Young Americans'' and ''Stations to Station'', but then went left-field (for American tastes?) with the Berlin trilogy. Big fame came then with what was very good pop on ''Let's Dance'' before he the remainder of the 80s and early 90s was ruined with uninspired pop and the appalling Tin Machine. He's never really hit the heights of the late 70s early 80s since, even though he's done some half-decent stuff since - most notably on ''Heathen''. --
[JD554]: As you've seen I've added info from the NY Times and Time magazine reviews. I've also added a reference to the 'Packaging' section for the album name coming from Weaver D's Delicious Fine Foods. But I can't find any references for the Miami hotels being used for the artwork. Is this covered in any of your print sources? --
[JD554]: I thought exactly the same thing when I saw that template and very nearly put it up for TfD but wasn't sure if it would get support. A category or even a list article would seem better options. Actually I think I will go for TfD, a navbox should be for logical navigation - will people really want to navigate from one diamond rated album to another? I don't think so. --
[JD554]: [[Wikipedia:Templates for deletion\/Log\/2009 March 19|Done]] --
[JD554]: I've not seen that, or heard the narration for that matter, but I've always imagined it to be similar to Bing Crosby's \""what's going on\"" look for \""Peace on Earth\/Little Drummer Boy\"" they did on his Christmas special. --
[JD554]: You're a bit of a Watchmen buff - shouldn't these ([[Watchmen: Music from the Motion Picture]], [[Watchmen: Original Motion Picture Score]]) be merged in to [[Watchmen (film)]]? --
[JD554]: Hi, I've noticed that you have added some more Australian chart positions and have cited ''Australian Chart Books 1940-2005''. Is this more than one book? If so, can you specifically add which one covers which chart positions. It would also be useful if you could add the publisher, publisher's location and ISBN(s) to the reference as well. Is there a specific reason for the note in the reference about pre-1989 information? --
[JD554]: In that case, I don't think the note is necessary. The link at the top of the columns is to [[ARIA Charts]] where it mentions about the Kent Music Report. Thanks for the help in getting the rest of the information for the reference, --
[JD554]: Yes I did. But the method for not linking looks cumbersome and more work, other editors had already mentioned that. They had also mentioned about excessive links, but I felt it better to add something than nothing at all. --
[JD554]: You've had your vote, I've had mine. Note doubt we'll both comply with community consensus. --
[JD554]: How's the job hunt going? --
[JD554]: Yeah, it's like saying \""we can't be bothered to review your article\"". You get good lists and bad lists, so there's no reason they shouldn't be rated just like other articles. --
[JD554]: They're not bad, ''The Honey Tangle'' is certainly worth a listen or two but I would never describe it as a must own album. If you do hunt down some of their stuff, don't expect The Fall - The Adult Net are definitely Brix Smith's lighter bubblier side coming out. If you've heard \""Crash\"" by [[The Primitives]] you're in the right area. --
[JD554]: I'm just firing up [[WP:AWB|AWB]] to give it a go. It's been a while since I used it, so I hope it works! --
[JD554]: Hi, regarding [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=David_Bowie&diff=285962928&oldid=285692325 this edit] to [[David Bowie]], please note that per [[WP:CAP#Credits]] it isn't necessary to put an attribution in the image caption. --
[JD554]: I don't know, it seems a couple of editors got together and decided try to rigidly enforce [[WP:NSONGS]], but I guess they hadn't read [[WP:BEFORE]] first. --
[JD554]: Good news on the job front I hope ... I'll keep my fingers crossed for you. --
[JD554]: Yeah, I was going to get around to that, but got sidetracked by an editor who thinks a song being on a playlist is noteworthy. --
[JD554]: I've just uploaded a new image of the Pixies to commons - [[:file:Pixies 2004.jpg]]. Do you think it should be used to replace the non-free image currently being used on [[Pixies]]? It's a little blurry when you look at the full sized image but looks OK when previewed in the infobox. It shows the whole band and is more recent than the non-free image currently being used. --
[JD554]: When you say \""that\"" which do you mean, the old or the new? No probs on [[The Bends]] by the way, I planned to do that either today or tomorrow anyway. --
[JD554]: That's what I was thinking. Any news on the job front? --
[JD554]: Sounds like an extreme way to lose weight. Keep plugging away, it might sound trite, but something will turn up. --
[JD554]: I see what you mean! Do you want me to give it a quick ce or do you need the practice? ;-) By the way, I thought Bowie left you cold?[http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Life_on_Mars%3F&diff=288436848&oldid=288434156] --
[JD554]: Yeah, I had noticed ... just a little banter ;-) If you've got a bit to add to the ''The Bends'', I'll wait a couple of hours to make sure you've finished and avoid edit conflicts. --
[JD554]: Man that is an awesome place. If you ever get the chance to go, I can highly recommend it! Didn't meet Sigur Ros, but did meet someone who worked with them and who owns one of the main recording studios on Iceland - I forget his name, but it did have a lot of esses in it! Well just another day to go and I've caught up on my watchlist. Any news on the second job front? --
[JD554]: \""Britpop\"" very much appears to be still in use[http:\/\/news.google.co.uk\/news?q=britpop&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&hl=en&tab=wn]. --
[JD554]: No problem, I'll have a look in the next day or two. --
[JD554]: I think the infobox is worth keeping as it still summarises Shaw's release which was probably better known than The Smiths' original - although I'm not sure it's an alt-rock release, maybe pop? But I agree there probably is a bit too much detail in the prose. --
[JD554]: Hehe, I'll have to hunt it down, it's a long long time since I saw that. --
[JD554]: No sooner said than done ... I was in the process of adding it anyway ;-) --
[JD554]: It does seem bizarrely soon after his last album. I'm surprised more bands\/singers don't release b-side compilations with singles becoming less and less popular. --
[JD554]: \""Not too impressed with Yorkshire pudding\""!!?? :( [[Wars of the Roses|Wars]] have been fought for less! Maybe you should try ... urgh, I can barely bring myself to say it ... [[Lancashire hotpot]] (I feel unclean). But if you want to persevere with food from [[Yorkshire|God's Own County]], then [[parkin (cake)|parkin]] is a very nice twist on ginger cake, or you could try [http:\/\/www.greatbritishkitchen.co.uk\/recipebook\/index.php?option=com_rapidrecipe&page=viewrecipe&recipe_id=1185 Yorkshire curt tart] (drain the liquid from cottage cheese as a reasonable alternative to curd cheese). Moving further out from Yorkshire, you could always try [[fish and chips]], there are some [http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/food\/recipes\/database\/deepfriedfishinbeerb_67776.shtml recipes] about but they're always better from a proper \""[[chippy]]\"" of course. For more inspiration, the BBC's food website[http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/food\/] is easily the best I've come across. --
[JD554]: Hmm, not too bad. Seems to be a bit of a cross between [[The Wedding Present]] and early [[The Waterboys|Waterboys]]. --
[JD554]: Tin Machine was a pretty dire period of Bowie's history, I don't even have it in my watchlist. With just a very few exceptions the mid-80s to the mid-90s wasn't a good period for Bowie. A music career that spanned from 1964 to 2004: out of that maybe only 1971 to 1983 is when he was really good, and probably a couple of years less for being at the cutting edge. Still, I bet a lot of musicians would kill for 10 or 12 years like that. But while the Berlin trilogy may be his peak for me, Tin Machine is definitely the nadir. --
[JD554]: Ooh tricky one. The best I've been able to come up with (and it's not a lot) is a 2004 article in ''The Stereo Times'' which describes MFSL as \""a company that remasters music\""[http:\/\/www.stereotimes.com\/speak092404.shtml]. I've not come across this magazine before, but looking at the \""Editorial Masthead\"" [http:\/\/www.stereotimes.com\/index.shtml here], it looks like it might be a self-published source. Another self-published source I've found is ''[http:\/\/www.soundstage.com\/about.shtml SoundStage!]'', a monthly magazine which has been going since 1995, so might be a slightly better bet. They specifically describe ''Reckoning'' as a remaster in [http:\/\/www.soundstage.com\/gold06.htm this] review of the MFSL version. MSFL on the [http:\/\/www.mofi.com\/productcart\/pc\/viewcontent.asp?idpage=14 history page] of their website describe themselves as using \""proprietary mastering techniques\"" but not specifically on ''Reckoning''. I'll keep searching, but I'm not holding out much hope for a specific statement by a definite reliable source. --
[JD554]: I've started a discussion at [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Albums#Language]] to see if we can get some sort of a consensus on this. --
[JD554]: Hey, no worries, we all know you're a dick anyay! ;-) ... joke!! ... Anyway, I still think it's a fundamental fact about an album that needs to be provided in the album's article. I don't agree that it's self-evident that any track is on an album, if the person reading the article doesn't have the album. Talking about making a dick of oneself, I've just nominated [http:\/\/toolserver.org\/~daniel\/WikiSense\/CheckUsage.php?i=Hallgr%C3%ADmskirkja.jpeg&w=_100000#end this very popular image] and a number of others for [[Commons:Commons:Deletion_requests\/Images_of_buildings_designed_by_Gu%C3%B0j%C3%B3n_Sam%C3%BAelsson|deletion at commons]]! This could be a bumpy ride... --
[JD554]: Yeah sure, I'll have a look today. --
[JD554]: You beat me to it, I was just removing it when I got an edit conflict! I was going to mention the \""Come as You Are\"" talk page that not even Azerrad felt it was worth mentioning the line in a ''New York Times'' article which mentions the topic of \""Adam's Song\"".[http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2004\/01\/04\/arts\/punk-s-earnest-new-mission.html] --
[JD554]: Finally got the charts done at [[Nevermind]]. Sorry for taking so long, --
[JD554]: From the European angle, my impression is that it brought a rockier sound to alt-rock despite it being a softer sound than their previous stuff and it's bringing grunge into the mainstream. I'll see if I can dig anything up that backs this up. --
[JD554]: Wow, what a [[synthpunk|mess]]. And who the heck is [[Damian Ramsey]]? I'm not sure he's even a notable person after having a search about. --
[JD554]: Yeah, I only picked up on it when [[User:Das Ansehnlisch]] started page moving to the wrong title. Got into a bit of a mess with it yesterday, but hopefully all sorted now. --
[JD554]: I could always upload [http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/brocco_lee\/2685073286\/ this one], it's got the right licence <weg> --
[JD554]: ''[[The Works (Echo & the Bunnymen album)|The Works]]'' looks to be a very good one, but being a 3 disc boxset is probably a bit pricey. If you can still find a copy, a cheaper decent alternative would the CD only version of ''[[More Songs to Learn and Sing]]''. I've sent you an email though. --
[JD554]: No, unfortunately Allmusic doesn't have them either. This billboard website redesign is a real pain. PS, sent you an email. --
[JD554]: Aye we got it back just today, but I don't think this is an official one anyway. Spandau? Hmm, I'd say very good in their genre (at least the earlier stuff), but I'm not a huge fan of their later stuff[http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=1OMyuyurFW0] or New Romantics in general. As far as Bowie acolytes go, this one is far superiour[http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EFQMw2wf2IE].  --
[JD554]: \""Gold\"" would never have been better Bond theme than these[http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wy97lOwvECs][http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JK2hKzZss5Y]. --
[JD554]: Ultravox aren't bad. I don't have anything by them (apart from on the odd compilation) but they've done some good stuff. \""Vienna\"" was actually kept of the number one spot over here by [http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=sFacWGBJ_cs this] abomination. --
[JD554]: Oh yes. A mid-week break in a small town (Eyemouth) just north of the Scottish border. A blissful time for walking and relaxing. --
[JD554]: It wasn't deliberate I'll have you know! :) After the Bowie's I needed one that would be easier and I happen to notice the Sisters' discog is still on the band page so thought I might get a DYK out of it too. --
[JD554]: For thy listening pleasure[http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=m3b9E1p9uOA] --
[JD554]: Cool, a heads up on what going to be half-decent would useful. ''[[The Fountain (album)|The Fountain]]'' gets released today, seems to have some very mixed reviews: the broadsheets seem generally in favour, while the music magazines are mostly against. No matter, I'll still get it, and probably enjoy it too. --
[JD554]: Things are going to be hectic at work for me for probably the next 6 weeks. Someone is going off ill and I'm acting up to their job (more stress, but more money too). Anyway, I'll probably only be dipping in a little during the week and may only get to do any serious editing at weekends with the odd evening thrown in. In the meantime I'll be listening to ''The Fountain'', it's not bad, I'd put it up there with ''Evergreen'' from their post-reformation period. I also got ''[[In This Light and On This Evening]]'', it's very heavy on the synths and will probably take a few listens through to get used to it. Cheers, --

[JD554]: I've just added references for the video directors to [[Nirvana discography]]. While doing it I found that according Kevin Kerslake he only co-directed the \""Lithium\"" video[http:\/\/kevinkerslake.com\/musicvideos.htm]. I found that the other co-director is likely to have been Mark Racco, but I can only find unreliable sources online[http:\/\/www.mvdbase.com\/video.php?id=20486]. Do you have any printed sources which might confirm this? In the spirit of [[WP:V]] I left the director as just Kevin Kerslake for now. --
[JD554]: Their early electro-pop is very very good. Their later stuff (1986 onwards) is good, and I can see that, but it just doesn't move me. --
[JD554]: A belated Merry Christmas to you too. I hope you're having\/have had a good holiday. All the best for 2010 --
[JD554]: You'd think someone who comes across as being as well-read as Morrissey would have been more carefull, but then again... --
[JD554]: I wish I did have more [[Time (David Bowie song)|time]] at the moment. Hopefully in a couple of weeks, I can be back up to my usual editing level. --

It would also help me finish off the two discogs I started. --
[JD554]: No I've not come across them before, I'll have to check them out. I'm going to see [[Thee Silver Mt. Zion]] tonight in Leeds, looking forward to that. --

[JD554]: Yeah, not clever. I've removed the certification table for the time being. I think there's no point in listing ones that haven't charted and we simply need an extra column on the chart table to list the actual certificates and not the sales thresholds. --

It really hasn't gotten as far, IMHO, about Wikipedian categories.  I've also been thiking about a straw poll related to UBX locations.  Would you be interested in working with me on a straw poll draft in my userspace? Nothing's there now, but I've sketched out some notes on my pc.  If we can focus on that part of the solution for a bit, we ''might'' be able to solidify an anchor point to attach other issues, such as categories. Regards,
[Rfrisbie]: Cool. I figured as much. I also assume that if ''we'' can agree to something, it ''might'' have a shot at moving things forward a little bit.  I'll let you know when there's something to rip apart! ;-)

A few months ago, I went to the U.S. association's discussion forum and tried to recruit editors for these types of articles.  I got ''zero'' replies! :-(  When I see someone who actually knows enough about the topic to even ''be aware of a link'', I want to encourage them (assume good faith - don't bite the newbies, as it were).  If a spam patrol \""slaps them on the hand\"" with a terse and interpretably confrontational revert, I'm not at all surprised it's so hard to get newbies to dig into sparse but specialized articles.

[Cplakidas]: Likewise a happy New Year Alessandro! I am checking your new article out, however you might like to read this free [http:\/\/www.doaks.org\/DOP54\/DP54ch15.pdf Dumbarton Oaks article] about the [[Zeyrek Mosque]]. I haven't found time to read it yet myself, but perhaps you can find some extra info to put into the article! Cheers,
[Cplakidas]: Hello Alessandro! Great work on the article, as usual (especially given the fact that not so long ago it had been deleted...). I have done my bit, however I have three questions: a) the webpage for the Water Supply Project seems to imply (and their maps indicate this too) that the original Byzantine aqueducts went further west into Thrace, and the Halkali and Belgrade Forest lines were subsidiary, or at any rate not connected with the Valens Aqueduct (which would also have been impossible because of insufficient elevation). So it would be incorrect to call the entire system \""Halkali Net\"". I've left it for now, but I'd like to know what your sources are saying. b) I'm not sure that \""Taksim\"" is Greek. Sure, the -ks- does not usually appear in Turkish words, but I cannot think of any similar Greek word (taxis etc) that has the meaning of \""water plant\"". Any clues? c) I don't know of any \""Jelus cistern\"" in Constantinople. Are you sure of the name? Anyway, keep up the good work - perhaps you could add some stuff to my pet article on the Walls of Constantinople, especially if you can get your hands on Millingen's book (impossible to find here in Greece). Sorry that the article I gave you wasn't of much help. If there's anything else, just tell me, although I'm rather busy with university exams right now... Cheers,
[Cplakidas]: Also, you should avoid repeating information: since you have created a separate \""tactics\"" section, limit all tactical descriptions there, removing them from the \""history\"" section. For instance, the use of the feigned flight tactic is mentioned thoroughly in the section on the 7th-8th century. You should take this down to the Tactics section. Indeed, most of the 7th-8th century section concerns structure, armament & tactics, and not history ''per se''. Just limit the history section to a brief summary of campaigns and major battles, their outcome and impact, political and major social or religious developments, etc. If I may suggest, take a look at the [[Byzantine navy]] page, which presents a quite clear distinction between history and organizational matters. Furthermore, there is too little information on the battles that led to the Ottoman conquest. The same actually also applies to the section on the 7th-8th century: it is taken up by organizational matters, with too little actual history. You might also want to include a short introduction to the Bulgars, as most readers won't be familiar who they were or where they came from. And a few maps are also more than necessary, so that they'll be able to actually put the cities mentioned in the article in a geographical context. I'll try to help, but as my university exams are coming up, I don't know how much time I'll have (probably too little). Also, it's always a good idea to submit it for a [[WP:PR|Peer Review]]. Cheers and best regards,
[Cplakidas]: Thanks for the wishes! :)
[Cplakidas]: Hello again Alex! I thought polytonic Greek was included in the standard Unicode packages in Windows. I guess I was wrong. You can nevertheless go [http:\/\/www.ellopos.net\/elpenor\/greek-texts\/greek-fonts.asp here] to download a couple of fonts. As for football, in 2004, as we say in Greece, \""God was sleeping\"". This time around, he wasn't. Pity for Italy, too, but I am glad our eastern neighbours made it through! Cheers,
[Cplakidas]: Coincidentally, as you've probably seen, I was already in the process of doing so. Done, for now. I'll throw another look on some of the church-mosque articles in the weekend. Cheers,
[Cplakidas]: Hello Tassos! First off, congratulations on writing this important article! I've began making some copyedits, trying to improve the flow of the language a bit and add some info for readers who are not familiar with the context. I also saw that you have included sources in Greek, and have had them autotranslated. Wouldn't it be better if we translated them directly  to English ourselves? I can easily do that, unless there is a reason why not. Cheers,
[Cplakidas]: I suspected as much. OK then. :) Cheers,
[Cplakidas]: I must say, it's always a pleasure to discover another new article by you, Tasos. It's like \""oh, great, I really wanted to write something on this, but never really had the time, etc.\"" It's much easier to go copyediting than writing it from scratch! :) Once again, good work! PS. if ever in some article you need help with translation from German\/Spanish\/French sources, I'll be happy to help. Cheers,
[Cplakidas]: Hello Alessandro! Long time no see! How are you? Everything fine, I hope. I have just uploaded a [http:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/Image:Byzantine_Constantinople_eng.png map of Constantinople], based on Janin's map, with the roads & various other corrections\/additions gathered by various more recent sources. However, since you have better access to bibliography concerning the City than I at the moment, I would be very glad if you could check it for errors and omissions whenever you have time. It's been rather long in the making, but I cannot rule out that any mistakes did not slip in (especially with me being a noob in making svg's, and having to redraw the topography alone three times to get it right). Cheers, and best regards,
[Cplakidas]: Oh. I am sorry to hear that. Whatever it is, hopefully you'll get over it. Take your time with the map, any help will be appreciated, but health comes first! My best wishes, and ''perastika'', as we say in Greece.
[Cplakidas]: Hello! I have been checking your recently created article on the [[Chlemoutsi]] castle (and I've come across several of your articles in the past). I am writing this to give some (hopefully constructive) criticism: please do not use automatic translators, and confine yourself to languages you speak really well. It is clear that your command of German is insufficient and even your translations from Greek to English look awkward at times. If you need help with translating an article, you can ask for it [[Wikipedia:Translation|here]] or by directly contacting a multilingual user. You should strive for quality edits, not quantity (although that, of course, is also desirable), and although many of your articles fill important gaps (the Chlemoutsi article being an excellent example), if the result is unreadable, then it's worthless. If the Greek and German articles weren't available for cross-checking, I wouldn't be able to make heads or tail of it, even though I have read books on the castle and am familiar with the region's history. Please do take some extra time & effort henceforth to smooth out the articles' language, check the links and provide some context. It would make your contributions that more valuable. Also, if you translate a foreign article, it might be best to stick with its content & structure and not mix several into one, unless you really know the subject. This would spare other users the not inconsiderable trouble of having to rewrite it all over again... :) Cheers,
[Cplakidas]: Hello again! I notice you did not even in the slightest take notice of what I wrote, and continue in the same manner. Your articles are barely understandable, and in order to copyedit them, one has to practically rewrite them all over again. Please stop adding machine translations, or at least put some effort into straightening them out afterwards.

I don't know whether the subject interests you, but since you are an editor whose experience and attitude I value, I thought I'd invite you to have a look at the ongoing [[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates\/Byzantine navy|second FAC nomination]] of the [[Byzantine navy]] article. \u0391\u03bd \u03ad\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03cc\u03c1\u03b5\u03be\u03b7, \u03c1\u03af\u03be\u03b5 \u03bc\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ac. Best regards,
[Cplakidas]: Hello again! The article has been successfully promoted. Thanks again for your vote! Cheers,
[Cplakidas]: I am pleased to inform you that the article has been successfully promoted. Thanks again for your support! Cheers,
[Cplakidas]: Hello Gligan! Long time no see :) I am afraid I have to disagree with you on this one. We have had an extensive and sometimes heated debate on the subject. The fact is that both sides claim victory. IMO, the Greek army was indeed in a bad position and rather exhausted, but had not yet been defeated. As of the armistice, it was actually launching local counter-attacks. We cannot claim a victory for either side when neither army collapsed, retreated or surrendered. Sure, to the Bulgarians, it may have been a moral victory, since the Greek advance was stopped, but on the field, it was a stalemate. Best regards,
[Cplakidas]: Well, I would agree with you, except: a strategic victory implies a reversal of the fortunes of the war. Bulgaria had been ''de facto'' defeated before Kresna ever started, because Romania had intervened in the war and was closing on Sofia. And Venizelos was urging the King to accept the armistice days before he actually did. I won't say that Kresna was a Greek victory, it wasn't (except insofar that a successful resistance to superior forces is a \""success\""), and it certainly is due to the battle that Constantine agreed to the cease-fire. As for the Bulgarians, it was a sort of \""feel-good\"" success since Constantine would have preferred to sign the armistice as conqueror in Sofia, but not really a major reversal... IMO it would be best to leave the infobox as it is and focus on expanding the article. Infoboxes are notoriously imprecise summaries, and if we want the nuances of the battle properly captured, it is best done within the main article.
[Cplakidas]: Hello! I know that the map is not entirely accurate (the eastern\/Armenian frontier is also too short), but it is based chiefly on Haldon's map, thus incorporating all the errors included therein. As for the Balkans, the problem is that Basil II (and Tzimiskes before him) instituted ''strategiai'' commanded by a ''strategos'' as local governorates in several places, but there is scant evidence of a full thematic structure in the territory of the old Bulgarian empire before the 1040s. Furthermore, themes were created and disbanded, both in the eastern frontier and in the Balkans, but the exact dates are uncertain. The map, as it is, attempts to present a rather idealized state of affairs. I will at some point (hopefully soon) be able to correct it with more sources (I also am aware of the modern views on the actual extent of Byzantine authority re Serbia). I've already got some, but if you know of any more, I'd be more than happy to include them. Best regards,
[Cplakidas]: Hello again. Yes, I have Stephenson's book, I'll indeed have to go over it again. As for map-making, I usually use ready-made topographic maps as a base, and work on that. I still haven't had time to get the hang of SRTM and the other topography tools available.
[Cplakidas]: Please please stop doing machine translations or trying to translate through guessing from a language you plainly do not understand. The results are horrible to say the least.
[Cplakidas]: Hello Gligan! It is a very interesting idea, which will also hopefully allow us to go into a bit more depth than is usual here, analyzing influence in religion, culture, society etc. A good title would be simply \""Relations between the Byzantine Empire and Bulgaria\"", which is ample enough to cover every possible aspect. Such an article is indeed fertile ground for a collaboration, but, unfortunately, time is the one thing I don't really have right now due to RL concerns. If you are willing to start it, I promise to help as much as I can, with sources, copyediting and counsel. If you want, send me an email, and I'll send you some English sources you'll no doubt find useful. As for the battle, most English-language writers largely cover it in a few short sentences: the siege of Serdica is mentioned, then the retreat and the ambush, and some comments given on its importance, i.e. the restoration of Bulgarian independence and the loss in prestige of Basil which resulted in the rebellions of the two Bardases. If requested, I'll be happy to supply citations (I may even do so either way, during the weekend, if I find the time). Best regards,
[Cplakidas]: I never write this email in public, so use [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Special:EmailUser&target=Cplakidas this form] and send me one. I'll then reply to your email address. Cheers,
[Cplakidas]: Hello again. I've been aware of the ongoing edit-warring in the articles on the Balkan Wars, but have consciously avoided being dragged into them. I am sorry, but I do not have the mood or time for a protracted edit-fight right now, particularly not with Factuarius. For what it's worth, I find the notion that the Bulgarian army's contribution was in someway not crucial as patently ridiculous. Even older Greek histories (which were not particularly pro-Bulgarian, or neutral for that matter) explicitly mention the fact that a) the Bulgarian army was the largest and best-equipped Balkan army and b) faced the most crucial front of the war. True, the Greek navy played a vital strategic role, but the main Ottoman forces were in Thrace, and Chataldja was reached by the Bulgarians. Anyway, I think that the debate has gotten too much out of hand. Personally, I would request an editprotection for a couple of weeks just to calm things down, and then perhaps an RfC.
[Cplakidas]: It is, and good old Bury was virtually the first serious work on Byzantium I ever read :) However if we include links to the text itself, IMO including entire passages is a bit redundant. We should summarize, like all encyclopedias. Anyhow, good work on these new articles, I am looking forward to more! Take care,
[Cplakidas]: Hello Mohammad! I removed that flag from several articles, because it is not really the \""Flag of the Byzantine Empire\"": the double-headed eagle was not used as an emblem until the 11th century (and is securely attested only after ca. 1320), in addition it was ''never'' featured in flags (as far as we know) but only on clothes etc, and never used on a yellow background but always deep red\/purple. This flag is a modern design (late 19th century) connected with the rise of Greek nationalism and irredentism. It is the current flag of the Greek Orthodox Church, but in no way is it a true Byzantine design, despite what many people think. I have written on the issue in [[Byzantine heraldry]] article. In short, the only truly attested Byzantine flag is [[:File:Flag of Palaeologus Emperor.svg|this]]. Best regards,
[Cplakidas]: Hello Tassos! Indeed long time no see, and I hope you're doing well. As for the check you requested, his edits do not appear to be vandalism (at least not in the Greece-related articles), quite the contrary: he is probably using the [[List of Prime Ministers of Greece]] as a source and making the corresponding changes. The numbers of succession for instance were changed across a number of articles by {{user|Ouranokatevatos}} who apparently prefers to number the distinct people who held an office instead of the number of the term (in other words, Kostas Karamanlis is the 91st person to be PM, but the head of the 181st cabinet per the list). Personally, I tend to agree with Big Axe's viewpoint and have myself reverted some of these changes. In any case, the edits are entirely legitimate as far as I can tell. Best regards and take care,
[Cplakidas]: Hello Todor! I have just begun an article on [[Sviatoslav's invasion of Bulgaria]], and am gradually expanding it. As it concerns a crucial period in Bulgarian history, but Bulgarian aspects are rather a bit lacking from the available bibliography (except for Fine's book), it'd be nice if you could check it as it goes along and carry out or propose changes\/modifications\/additions. Best regards,
[Cplakidas]: Hello Gligan! I have just begun an article on [[Sviatoslav's invasion of Bulgaria]], and am gradually expanding it.

Best regards,
[Cplakidas]: All right, thanks for the quick response and the suggestions. I have not yet found adequate mention of the initial clashes, so whatever source you have is more than welcome. I intend to flesh the article out over the next days, during which time any suggestions will be welcome. Just for your information, what I would most like to know (for now) from Bulgarian sources falls into three broad categories: a) the Bulgarian participation in the military side of the conflict, b) the perceptions by the Bulgarians of the Rus' occupation and of the Byzantine \""liberation\"", both contemporary (and perhaps more modern as well, I don't know if and how this event influenced modern Bulgarian historiography or perceptions), and finally c) retrospectively, the effects on Bulgarian statehood. The sources I already have cover much of this, but (again except for Fine), they are often slightly biased or elliptic. Anyhow, here's to a fruitful collaboration. Cheers,
[Cplakidas]: OK, thanks for the quick reply. I'll try to finish as much as I can over the next few days before Easter. As I told Gligan, the chief concerns I hope to be addressed by Bulgarian sources fall into three broad categories: a) the Bulgarian participation in the military side of the conflict, b) the perceptions by the Bulgarians of the Rus' occupation and of the Byzantine \""liberation\"", both contemporary and modern, and c) the effects on Bulgarian statehood. Any help, criticism or advice would be welcome. Happy Easter meanwhile, and best regards,
[Cplakidas]: It was precisely this part that was missing: \""According to that treaty the Bulgarians had to allow the Magyars to pass through Bulgaria when they want to raid in Byzantium\"". Otherwise the treaty would not seem to concern Byzantium. I'll add it right away.
[Cplakidas]: Well, the short answer is, there was no \""Byzantine flag\"" in the 7th century, at least not in the sense we speak of flags today. Byzantium used a variety of banners and signa, but no single design was used as a \""national\"" flag. If you want a representative symbol, I'd suggest using a Chi-Rho (for example [http:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:Chirho.svg this] or [http:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:Simple_Labarum2.svg this]).
[Cplakidas]: Please, please learn Greek and\/or stop using machine translators. Your recent article on [[Panagiotis Benakis]] was complete and utter nonsense, and so are all other articles you have \""translated\"". If you do not know the language, leave it alone. Per [[Wikipedia:Translation]], '''an unedited machine translation, left as a Wikipedia article, is worse than nothing'''.
[Cplakidas]: And still you continue: the article on the [[Tourkovounia]] was a complete mess. Even I, who come from Athens and know the place, had trouble understanding it. You plainly do not understand Greek, you have no concept of the geographical or historical contexts involved, nor, it appears, are you capable of writing in good English. For the last time, stop, or I'll begin a RfC on you and request sanctions. Your articles are worse than worthless. Either confine yourself to writing stubs with whatever info you ''do'' understand from an article, or abstain altogether.
[Cplakidas]: What part of \""stop making machine translations in languages you do not comprehend\"" do you not understand? For the last time, stop this practice. If you cannot guarantee that the translation is correct, leave it be. I have had enough cleaning up your mess. Next time, I'll go for RfC.
[Cplakidas]: Hello! As I wrote to Markus too, there is also the question of the RfC's \""desired outcome\"". Obviously what we'd like him to do is either start contributing \""normally\"" or, failing that, stop creating new articles. But is not the latter tantamount to asking for a ban?
[Cplakidas]: All right, I largely agree with you here, except, pulling his auto-patrol is another form of sanction, and it will not prevent him from creating work for others. I feel that if we don't want this RfC to go the way of the last one, and in order to have Pumpie respond meaningfully, there should be a degree of compulsion: i.e. that he agrees to respond to messages, appropriately tag ''and'' copyedit the pages himself, and in general change his editing behaviour drastically, with the clear proviso that failing that, he will be subject to sanctions. I also feel that he should state clearly what languages he speaks and in what degree. If he states that he can't actually read Greek or French, then it is obvious that he should not get involved with attempting translations ''at all''.
[Cplakidas]: I have no problem with your changes, I suppose as the RfC progresses we will see what can be done if Pumpie carries on as usual. I am waiting for Markus' response, and then I'll place the RfC (although I may be absent from a PC for the next week or so)...
[Cplakidas]: You beat me to the greeting :)! Glad to see you back here after so long. Thanks for the appreciative comments, I look forward to work with you once again! Cheers,
[Cplakidas]: Alas, no... I've been dying to go again to the City for a couple of years now, especially with the Yenikapi dig going on, but haven't found either the time or the money to do so. I really envy you your trips there ;) If you have any photos, please please upload them in Commons.
[Cplakidas]: Ah, I see. Pity... Anyhow, I am chiefly interested in the ships found at Yenikapi for the [[Byzantine navy]] article, do you have any info on them? So far I have only been able to find bits and pieces online.
[Cplakidas]: Indeed. However the tags are mostly for project maintenance, and reviewing them does not preclude any interested editor from reading them, either ;). As for the Judaeo-Italian languages, you are right, there is relevance. I've reverted the removal. However in many other cases, such as the [[Den\xe9-Caucasian languages]] etc, I can't really see any connection. Best regards,
[Cplakidas]: What I propose (chiefly with the eventual topical overview articles in mind) is another broad division between 1863 and 1909, when the Goudi coup and the arrival of Venizelos changed the political scene overnight, 1909 to 1924 as the period of great changes, expansion and tragedy, the period of the Second Republic to 1935 (already extant both as article and category), 1935 to 1949 again as a transitional period, a \""post-war\"" section from 1949 to 1974, and finally, contemporary Greece from 1974 on. I am also thinking that perhaps the 2nd Republic should be united with the 1935-1949 period as a \""second phase\"" of the national schism and the eventual emergence of the Communist\/Leftist \""threat\"" as the chief \""other\"" pole in the Greek political spectrum. Regards,
[Cplakidas]: Yannis is sadly inactive. As for Todor, I too would wholeheartedly support a candidacy. The funny thing is, I was just about to about point Sulmues here when I saw that he had already asked ;)
[Cplakidas]: Ahem, let's see first if he wants to ;). Also, I would refrain from canvassing of any sort, no matter how well-intentioned. This usually backfires...
[Cplakidas]: Hello again! I have [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Greece#Overhaul of modern Greek history|tabled]] the proposal, and am awaiting input. Best regards,
[Cplakidas]: With best regards, :)
[Cplakidas]: I have [[Template talk:Did you know#Stephen Lekapenos and Constantine Lekapenos|nominated]] the two brothers for DYK. Cheers,
[Cplakidas]: Hello Alessandro! The suburb of [[Kosmidion]] did indeed receive its name from the Monastery of Saints Cosmas and Damian, it is very well attested. Now, as to the Roman church, the article's info could also be true. \""Kosmos\/Kosmema\"" is the Greek word for \""ornament\"" (hence \""[[Cosmos]]\""). If the church had been named after St Cosmas, a relation to Kosmidion would be tenable, but as it stands, there doesn't seem to be a reason for the two to be related. From a brief search in Google Books, the article's claim seems to be valid... Cheers,
[Cplakidas]: Nope, it is correct. I Had created the redirect as a first step to (eventually) writing a short article about the quarter and the monastery, since Kosmidion is actually a small part of the modern district of Eyup. I have only the ODB with its small relevant passage to go on, so, since you have access to Janin, a most excellent source, if you want to, go ahead and make a start.
[Cplakidas]: Ah, I see. I added the name. Pity about Janin, I did hope he'd say more. Most of the books I have on Constantinople have next to nothing on Kosmidion. :(
[Cplakidas]: Hello! I am currently [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Military history\/Assessment\/Sviatoslav's invasion of Bulgaria|nominating]] the article on [[Sviatoslav's invasion of Bulgaria]] for WPMILHIST A-class, and the image of Sviatoslav and Tzimiskes' meeting is used there. Could you please provide a source for it, as it is required by the criteria? Thanks in advance, and best regards.
[Cplakidas]: That being said, I too would love to see Justinian get his little featured article star, along with Belisarius, the Gothic War (I've always been meaning to get it in shape, but never get around to it...), Procopius and John Troglita (a personal favourite). As you said, each of them would be a task of truly gigantic proportions, certainly too much for any one editor. If you want to collaborate on any article, I'd be able to get access to a ton of sources, the only problem on my part would be time. Any particular articles in mind?
[Cplakidas]: If you can expand on Peter the Patrician, I'd be grateful. I am not really good with literary stuff, and that is really what is missing to get him to FA. BTW, check your email...
[Cplakidas]: I truly believe that you want to contribute constructively, and normally, I would be overjoyed to see someone tackling the more obscure Greece-related articles. However, when they have to be re-translated before they become understandable, then they serve no purpose. If you intend to continue contributing here, then your English simply ''must'' improve, and you must spend more time checking and correcting your articles both before and after posting them. Use a sandbox and\/or get input from other users if necessary, but please do not ignore what they have to say. I'll say it in Greek too to be sure: \u03c6\u03af\u03bb\u03b5, \u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03c5\u03c7\u03ce\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac \u03c3\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03b5\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03c6\u03c1\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2. \u0395\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03ac \u03c4\u03bf \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03b5\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1 \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03ce\u03c2 \u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf, \u03ba\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc \u03ba\u03ac\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7 \u0392\u03b9\u03ba\u03b9\u03c0\u03b1\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03bf \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u03b2\u03ac\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03ad\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03b1 \u03ac\u03c1\u03b8\u03c1\u03b1 \u03b4\u03b9\u03cc\u03c4\u03b9 \u03b4\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03ac\u03c3\u03c7\u03b7\u03bc\u03b7 \u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03cd\u03c0\u03c9\u03c3\u03b7. \u039c\u03ac\u03b8\u03b5 \u03c0\u03c1\u03ce\u03c4\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac \u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac \u03ae \u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03b2\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03ad\u03c8\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c7\u03c1\u03ae\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b2\u03bf\u03b7\u03b8\u03ae\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd \u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c3\u03b9\u03b5\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03ba\u03ac\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf \u03ac\u03c1\u03b8\u03c1\u03bf. \u0391\u03bd \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03b5\u03af\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b2\u03ad\u03b2\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03af \u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ba\u03ac\u03c4\u03b9, \u03bc\u03b7\u03bd \u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03cd\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2. \u03a1\u03ce\u03c4\u03b1, \u03c8\u03ac\u03be\u03b5, \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b1\u03bd \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf \u03b2\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2, \u03bc\u03b7\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2. \u039d\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bb\u03b1\u03bc\u03b2\u03ac\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf \u03cc\u03c4\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 100% \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03cc\u03c4\u03b9 \u03b5\u03af\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c3\u03af\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03cc\u03c4\u03b9 \u03ad\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03c6\u03c1\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c3\u03c9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac.
[Cplakidas]: Pumpie, your recent articles are better, but only by virtue of being shorter. You still guess wildly when you translate, as here: \""The station was used for exchanging passengers between Kiato-Sikiona and Diminio stations, with the line pointing to Patras in which it terminated in Kiato\"", when all it means is that there is a branch located between Kiato-Sikiona and Diminio that leads from the old line to the new Kiato station. \""\u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03c0\u03c1\u03ad\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c5\u03b3\u03c7\u03ad\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\"" also means \""it must not be confused\"", not \""it has no connections\""... For the n-th time, if you don't know something, ask, seek help or leave it alone.
[Cplakidas]: Pumpie, I am now convinced that you do not, in fact, understand Greek, but translate on a word for word basis, guessing as you go. \""The line shut down except for the exploitation in 1969.\"" could never come from \""\u0397 \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03ae \u03c4\u03ad\u03b8\u03b7\u03ba\u03b5 \u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 \u03b5\u03ba\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf 1969\"" except by someone who doesn't understand the sentence. And yet again you prove that you are not yourself Greek, for no Greek would ever consider Kakosalesi to have been named \""[[Kakosalesion]]\"" in Katharevousa, simply because \""Kakosalesi\"" was a colloquial, \""vulgar\"" name and was never rendered into Katharevousa. And even if it had, then the tone would fall in the ante-penultimate syllable, giving us \""Kakosal\xe9sion\"", and not \""[[Kakos\xe1lesion]]\"". This is elementary Greek phonology... I am asking this for the last time: which country do you come from, and what language do you speak? Please answer directly and to the point.
[Cplakidas]: No, Kakosalesion is ''not'' an older name of Avlona. Please read what I wrote above (and see what [http:\/\/www.google.gr\/#hl=el&source=hp&biw=1440&bih=696&q=%CE%9A%CE%B1%CE%BA%CE%BF%CF%83%CE%B1%CE%BB%CE%AD%CF%83%CE%B9%CE%BF%CE%BD&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=&fp=32f1d92cf17f72d7 Google has to say]). You plainly do not understand the rules concerning the addition of -on after names, because I have seen that you plaster it on almost every article you create regardless of whether it fits.
[Cplakidas]: No, you do not get the point. \""Kakosalesion\"" as a name ''never existed'', it is your creation... It refers to neither the settlement nor the train station.
[Cplakidas]: PS, I would seriously like an answer to my question above. What is your native language and where do you come from?
[Cplakidas]: Good spotting. Moved some articles around to be more accurate.
[Cplakidas]: No, Pumpie, you will not defer or evade the answer as you have done so many times. For once, give a straight reply. At the very least, what is your native language.
[Cplakidas]: Agree with Todor. It's a nice article, and inline references would help it get more attention via DYK.
[Cplakidas]: Great article, I was always meaning to write it myself, but never got around to it. It is indeed a beautiful place, albeit for a Greek rather a sad one...
[Cplakidas]: Sad because in a few years, the Balikli graveyards will be all that's left of the Greek community in the City... And after they are gone, I don't think the Turkish government will care much to maintain the place.
[Cplakidas]: From your mouth to God's ear, as the saying goes... :)
[Cplakidas]: Believe me you deserve it. And I am sure that somewhere along the way, a WPTR award will come too... Cheers,
[Cplakidas]: Pumpie, even Markussep, who doesn't claim to speak Greek, understands the Greek articles better than you. Your translations remain very much problematic. Please, for the last time, tell us what your native language is so that we can find some way for you to contribute constructively, otherwise no one can help you.

[Cplakidas]: Could you for once answer a question directly without going into irrelevant discourse? You can answer my question without Greek characters, so stop deferring it. Also, what are \""tertiary words\"" supposed to be? Do you or do you not speak or otherwise use Greek on a daily basis? Pumpie, I don't know about the others, but I am way past having lost patience with your evasions. If you continue as you have until now I will ask for an indefinite block.
[Cplakidas]: Hello Gligan! I'll probably check the article tomorrow (holiday, yay!). On the \""Bulgarian\/Bulgar\"" issue, AFAIK most authors retain the \""Bulgar\"" until ca. 863 and the Christianization of Bulgaria, when it transitioned from the \""Bulgar Khanate\"" to the \""Bulgarian Principality\"" and later Empire. From what I understand, this is because prior to that point the Bulgar\/Bulgarian state had not yet developed (or better, the development had not yet culminated) its definitive \""Bulgarian\"" character, which includes Christianity and an increase of Byzantine and Slavic cultural influence vs the fading Turkic elements. I agree that it is essentially the same state and the same people, but I tend to follow my sources closely. At least for the period prior to ca. 860, I think I'll retain \""Bulgar\"" to be consistent with them. I will be making more maps however for the period thereafter, and I will definitively use \""Bulgarian\"" there. No hard feelings, I hope :)
[Cplakidas]: Pumpie, it is up to you what you will do. But if you want to continue contributing here, you need to improve your English skills dramatically. If you really want to help, stop now, go to an English language school, learn how to use English well, and then return to the project. So far, your own \""slow improvement\"" has been glacial in its pace... I would also suggest that you learn Greek, because whether you actually speak it or not (I believe the latter), it is clear that you do not comprehend it anywhere near the level required for translating. And if you intend to continue with Greek articles that are more complex than railway stations, you should also make an extra effort to acquaint yourself with Greek history and culture, because you are constantly getting the names, terms, events, and general context wrong. And this will probably take some years, not weeks or months. You have also by now created [http:\/\/toolserver.org\/~soxred93\/pages\/index.php?name=Pumpie&namespace=0&redirects=noredirects&getall=1 thousands] of articles, many of them remaining in their original mistranslated state. Your concern should be improving them first before embarking on creating new articles. Not bothering with this, despite repeated prompting, is the one signal and most irritating failure on your part thus far. Bad English and ignorance of certain historical etc details may be forgiven at times, but systematically dumping your mess onto the project with an expectation that someone will clean it up, and without once so far bothering to improve even a single word, can not. I cannot say this any clearer. Shape up, or on the next mangled translation I see, I will ask for a permanent block.
[Cplakidas]: If he goes to the Greek Wikipedia with the level of Greek he's displayed so far (which is zero), he'll be blocked right away... Either way, I agree with Markussep. Enough is enough.
[Cplakidas]: Well done, as usual. I made a few cosmetic changes, added a map, and tagged a couple of problematic places. What do you mean by \""freed\"" in the second paragraph of the History section?
[Cplakidas]: OK, I fixed it (I think) :). Cheers,
[Cplakidas]: Anyhow, per se the article is a fine B-class. To go to GA, the only thing missing IMO is adding citations to sentences at the ends of paragraphs that lack one at the moment. Adding a map of the Balkans at the time to show the various locations would be a welcome plus for the readers not familiar with the region. Also, a minor nitpick, but on a couple of occasions you cite \""a Byzantine historian\"" (Skylitzes?). It'd be better if you named him or them directly, so that an interested reader can check this up.
[Cplakidas]: I didn't realize that the part from Runciman came from the Polish version, I assumed that you checked it up yourself. That is the problem with translations... As I said, the article is otherwise very good, including the balanced viewpoint part. Indeed your contributions have much improved since our first interactions, and I did find this lapse a bit peculiar. I hope I didn't offend you, it was merely meant as constructive criticism from someone who has been there before and knows the traps the mind all too easily falls into ;)... For the historian, OK, I'll try a search on my own and see what I can find. For the map, I prefer Bury's, although I am working on one for the period myself, and when it is done, I'll upload it. If you want it to get past GA, you might also give a shot at a peer review at [[WP:MILHIST]], I highly recommend it.
[Cplakidas]: I have had a look at his contributions there. Full of grammatical and syntax errors, and all his edit summaries are in English. After being told off by several users, he has stopped contributing new content for several years now. Given that he has failed even once to produce any evidence that he is capable of writing in Greek on his own (his Greek WP articles are usually dab pages and hence most likely copy-pastes), and as he has not once replied in Greek either here or in the Greek WP, his claim of being a native Greek speaker is, if not a lie, then a very big exaggeration...
[Cplakidas]: |style=\""vertical-align: top; border-top: 1px solid gray;\"" | I am happy to award you with the Barnstar of WikiProject Greece for your valuable contributions to Greece-related articles. Especially in the area of politics, you have done superb work in expanding Wikipedia's coverage! Cheers,
[Cplakidas]: Hello again. Regarding Pumpie's translations, if you are willing to help correcting even a few of them, it would be a great help!
[Cplakidas]: Hello again dear Doctor! I hope you are well :) Please have a look at [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Greece#Help needed from all project members|this]]. We are currently in the process of compiling a worklist, but if you are willing to help, please let us know. Having done not a few myself, I know it is onerous and tedious work, but any help, even for a couple of articles, would be appreciated.
[Cplakidas]: As I wrote elsewhere, by virtue of his inability or unwillingness to understand what we're telling him and reply coherently, [[WP:DNFTT]] seems to be the best course of action when dealing with Pumpie.
[Cplakidas]: Hello again! Should we prefer the \""XXX (municipality)\"" or the \""Municipality of XXX\"" format? Personally I have a slight preference for the latter (except for cases where the distinction is clear, e.g. [[Georgios Karaiskakis (municipality)]]), since in Greek, the \""municipality\"" bit is usually included in the name, especially since XXX and the municipality named after it are usually nowhere near coterminous. What do you think? Regards,
[Cplakidas]: Hello Todor! Indeed a weird case, although it would be nice if we could report an actual ghost attack ;). I have Failler's edition of Pachymeres, and can verify the story (Germe\/\u0393\u03ad\u03c1\u03bc\u03b7 or Soma was a town between Pergamon and Akhisar acc. to Failler's notes). As this is certainly before Roger's death and during his expedition in 1303\/4, I guess your source got it wrong... It is not unusual, late Byzantine chronology is usually a mess, everyone disagrees with everyone else (and Failler gets some dates wrong too). If you need me to check anything else in Failler, feel free to ask. Cheers, my friend.

[Cplakidas]: Hello again! As you may have noticed, I have recently become interested in the Arab opponents of Byzantium, whose coverage, let alone the quality of the existing articles, is woefully lacking. As I want to throw some spotlight on them, do you have any good DYK hook suggestions for [[Sulayman ibn Hisham]] and\/or [[Nasr ibn Sayyar]]? Thanks in advance,

[Cplakidas]: Very good proposals. Thanks :)
[Cplakidas]: Hello! Congrats on your patience with going about year after year and standardizing the relevant pages, but you have got a few things wrong: first, the Byzantine regnal dating you favour is way too euro-centric, excluding the rest of the world. Even in Europe, the system was far from universally used, and even in the Byzantine Empire, dating by [[indiction]] was the usual shorthand. Furthermore, consular dating had in effect been abolished, only very few writers using it after 541, and almost no one in real life. Same goes for the AUC format. IMO it is best to leave the lede with the Common Era year alone, since that is the de facto universal system. Otherwise we would have to add every single other system, and that is precisely what the \""YYY in other calendars\"" navbox is for. Best regards,
[Cplakidas]: Hello Alessandro! Your action was quite correct. There are a number of policies that deal with this, chiefly [[Wikipedia:Content forking]]. In essence, this user created a content fork with no apparent value as a stand-alone article, and without even crediting the original author\/article as required per [[Wikipedia:Splitting]]. Happy Christmas to you and your family too!
[Cplakidas]: The situation is bad. Not yet hopeless, but bad. People are losing their jobs, and those who have them often get unpaid as there isn't any cash available. Rents, debts and salaries are often not paid for months at a time. We are still waiting for some research grants we were \""definitely\"" promised in September and which we don't know when and if they will ever come. I've got colleagues who are owed arrears for teaching jobs at universities for over a year now. Those who suffer most are lower middle-class people, i.e. the bulk of the population, but mostly in Athens. The provinces have not yet felt the impact so hard, chiefly because there is the usual \""big family\"" support mechanism, and because life is about 50% cheaper there than the capital. But I can tell you, if someone shot a politician tomorrow (regardless of which party, the political system is thoroughly discredited), quite a few would applaud it.
[Cplakidas]: Hello, and happy holidays! Kudos to you too for writing these articles. However, I don't really understand what you mean by comparing \""nysada\"" and \""nisada\"". What have these names to do with Gianysada?
[Cplakidas]: Hello! Yes, ''nisida'' is \""islet\"", but it does not follow that any name with it or variants thereof has anything to do with \""island\"". Dionysades is straightforward, it comes from Dionysos, it has nothing to do with \""nisades\"", which does not exist in Greek. Gianysada also has no apparent relation with \""nisida\"". Its weird spelling with the hypsilon alone precludes this, it must be a corrupted form of an earlier name. \""Nysida\"" or \""nisada\"" don't exist as words in Greek. Please don't confuse English transliterations, which often blur the distinctions between the various vowels, with the actual Greek words. For the categories, as a rule of thumb I'd suggest to avoid over-doing it with pedantic divisions: the islands are rather obscure, a simple category \""Cretan islands\"" or the likes would suffice. Happy New Year to you too!
[Cplakidas]: Well, the full form for this name is actually Palaiokastro (\""old castle\""), with Paliokastro as a vernacular alternative. As both forms are rather common throughout Greece, disambiguation is certainly needed (I'd put the main dab page at [[Palaiokastro (disambiguation)]].
[Cplakidas]: (unindent) Nipson, the TRNC may be unrecognized, but it exists, whether we like it or not, for what  is almost 30 years now. Whatever the status of its (non-)recognition, no footballer ever sat along with the President of Cyprus and the UN General Secretary at a negotiation table as an equal partner. The office, the state, the articles on its presidents, prime ministers etc are notable and necessary for any encyclopedia, just as we have articles on [[South Ossetia]] or the [[Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus]]. You've been warned before on trying to impose your specific POV on certain issues (the Olympics and their origin), so you should know by now that what seems \""evident\"" to you may not be that \""evident\"" to everyone else. I think you can contribute much to WP, but please stop with the [[WP:TRUTH]]-campaigning.
[Cplakidas]: Nipson, sorry if you feel offended... The fact is that you go about each and every subject with enthusiasm but also with an apparent single-mindedness and zealotry with regards to your own viewpoint. All I am saying is that you should try to be less confrontational and not reject others' opinions out of hand when they disagree with you. The TRNC exists as a de facto state for decades now. We cannot close our eyes to that fact, no matter what its legal status or its dependence on Turkey, and these are the main arguments you used in your AfDs, not lack of citations (which in itself is ''not'' a criterion for article deletion). WP follows standard practice in including these articles (check other sources like the BBC or Britannica and you'll see that they too mention the TRNC and its \""presidents\"", even if in parentheses or quotation marks or by variant terms like North Cyprus etc). Would you also accuse WP of representing Greek POV because it has an article on the [[Republic of Pontus]], which was arguably even less of a real state than the TRNC has been? For better or worse, WP has to accommodate all POVs (minus the most extreme ones) in an attempt to be neutral and ''not to pass judgment''.
[Cplakidas]: Hello Alessandro! Nice photos indeed! For the video, AFAIK all Wikipedia cares about is that it is properly licensed. We don't really go for the \""religious sensitivities\"" thing (or any other sort of sensitivity), so for instance we have photos of [[Bah\xe1'u'll\xe1h]], we have depictions of [[Muhammad]] etc. It is the user's business how he got the video, but as long as it was he who did it, he can upload it and use it as he wants. Cheers,
[Cplakidas]: Go ahead! He has an amazing mastery of colours, I wish I could take photos half as good as his...
[Cplakidas]: Hello Todor! I've rewritten [[Momchil]]'s article, and I'd like you to take a look whenever you have a chance. The English sources are a bit contradictory (especially Fine) on the chronological sequence of his actions, and I'd appreciate some feedback from the Bulgarian side. The Bulgarian source included in the article seems to have some nice info, it'd be nice to include it. Cheers,
[Cplakidas]: Great work! I've added a few more details and a nice quote from Kantakouzenos. Nice DYK hook. I also feel the article could go for GA at this point, unless you think there might be more to add. My sources are rather limited, unfortunately, so I can't really judge... Cheers,
[Cplakidas]: Fine. We can always add any new sources we find, but as it is, the article satisfies the complete coverage criteria. I'll submit it for GA right away. As always, it was a pleasure working with you :) Cheers,
[Cplakidas]: Hello Alex, I hope you are well! Although there are quite a lot of books on it in Greek, personally I am unaware of any English-language publications on the matter. From what I've read, the prevailing opinion among the more serious scholars is that it was not a \""genocide\"" in the sense that there was not a systematic, government-sponsored annihilation campaign as that directed against the Armenians. As you know, labelling an event as \""genocide\"" is mostly a political weapon nowadays and is so frequently used that it has virtually lost its meaning. While the Pontians too were subject to the forced labour battalions during WW1, they were not really targeted for extermination, and some of the local bishops were able to prevent even their conscription in the labour battalions, and in turn protected the Muslim population during the Russian occupation of 1916-1917. Most casualties occurred during the chaotic situation in the Pontus in 1918-1922, when government control collapsed and the countryside was dominated by Greek and Turkish armed bands. Needless to say, violence was reciprocal, but still rather limited. The Turks did not undertake a more systematized suppression and deportation campaign until 1921-22, to remove the threat of a second front during the Greek advance in the west. This sparked the most bloody phase, with a very violent guerrilla warfare going on as the Pontians were driven from the cities to the mountains. On the Turkish side, the bands of Topal Osman, loosely controlled by the Kemalist government, were responsible for several atrocities, while the Pontians too did undertake several reprisals and massacres against Muslim villages. Even so, the number of Pontian victims overall is comparatively low: IIRC, some 25,000-30,000, depending on estimates. It was certainly an act of ethnic cleansing, but if the Kemalists had wanted to eradicate the Pontians, they'd have done it and no one would have been able to do anything about it.
[Cplakidas]: I'd say, persist. This mania to label everything as genocide is not only absurd, it is pernicious. The word is so loaded with negative connotations that it only perpetuates hatred and divisions, while distorting the true historical events. It makes a monolithic tale out of the complex weave that is human history, places it on a pedestal with the words \""don't touch\"" upon it, stopping any genuine research and reflection on causes and significance. It must be opposed, whether it comes from Greek, Turkish, Italian, Albanian, Chinese or whatever else nationalists.
[Cplakidas]: PS, Lewellyn Smith is one of my favourite authors too. Even though he is an ardent philhellene, he does not hesitate to call a spade a spade when it comes to what actually happened. I've gifted a Greek edition of his book to most of my friends...
[Cplakidas]: Well, being a philhellene does not (necessarily) mean being unobjective or biased. Scholars like Finlay, Runciman, Smith, Mazower are all interested in Greece and appreciate and love Greek history, culture and the Greek people, but that doesn't stop them from being objective and telling the dark side, the errors and crimes, of Greek history as well, just like many Greeks do (Sotiriou being an excellent case in point). It's only nationalists who view this as \""treason\"" to the \""cause\"". Personally, I am with [[Dionysios Solomos]]: \""the nation must learn to consider as national what is true\"", an adage all too often ignored.
[Cplakidas]: Hello again Todor! I've just finished a major (and long-intended) overhaul of the article on [[Thomas the Slav]]. It is a complex subject where many differing views have had to be represented, and I don't know how it looks to an uninvolved reader. I am also seriously considering splitting off the rebellion to a separate article, and keeping a condensed form at the biographical article. Before going to peer review at WPMILHIST or GA, I'd be grateful if you, as one of the most experienced editors for the period, could run it through whenever you have time and make copyedits or suggestions for clarifications, improvement or even wholesale restructuring as you see fit. Cheers,
[Cplakidas]: Thanks a lot for taking the time :). I also mostly lean towards keeping the article as it is, since Thomas is primarily known for and through his rebellion. I have however taken it to WPMILHIST peer review to get a few more opinions, and then I'll submit it for GA etc. Cheers,
[Cplakidas]: Hello Alexi! I've finally decided to revive the WPGR newsletter, and have begun a first draft [[User:Cplakidas\/Sandbox#WPGR newsletter|at my sandbox]]. I intend to have it out by March 25. As you were the only one to have expressed interest a few months back, do you have any suggestions as to what we could include in addition to the topics covered? Or any other suggestion really, on content, style and looks.
[Cplakidas]: On the history task force, there are a number of problems. For one, it would be essentially a recreation of the old WP:History of Greece, which is the ancestor of WP:GREECE - and furthermore, WP:GREECE is by the definition of its scope as much about the wider Greek history as about modern Greece. Then, there is the question of purpose: how and why does the topic necessitate a different task force? If the purpose is to differentiate historical articles from others, the \""topic=history\"" parameter in the WPGR banner already does that. Three, there is the question of participation: there should be at least five to ten committed users to justify a branching off, and currently even at WP:GREECE it's only a handful editors who are active. You have just to look at the Politics and politicians and Athens task forces to see how early zeal can peter off. Sadly, we are too few to have dreams about task forces. Even the mighty and well-maintained WPMILHIST has curtailed its own task forces to what are essentially membership and article lists and little else. I've been thinking for years about setting up a Byzantine task force or WikiProject, but if it is going to be me and four to five other users (with me probably being the only one interested in any sort of administrative work), it's not sustainable. IMO, if a specific topic is dear to you, you are best off by starting or upgrading and maintaining a [[WP:PORTAL|portal]]. You could for instance begin an Epirus or Greek History portal, which would IMO be a far greater help than a rather redundant administrative department.
[Cplakidas]: PS, congrats on the [[Hellenic Nomarchy]] GA! No. 100 for WP:GREECE!
[Cplakidas]: Thanks for the medal! To be precise though, if we count the FAs and A-classes, we've passed 100 a long time ago. \""100\"" is just for the category counter, but it is a psychological boundary nonetheless ;) Here's to reaching 150 by next year, plus a few more FAs and A-class articles (it'd be nice to get 2% of our articles to GA and above, most projects are below 1%)... BTW, did you consider the stuff I mentioned above on portals? And please, if you have time to spare, try to check a few of Pumpie's articles, no matter how short or unimportant. Most of them are short Starts, and are easy to translate from the Greek original. Even one a week would be a great help! Best regards,
[Cplakidas]: Bingo! You are quite right, there is a lot of furore the past few days over a statement of the Turkish FM, Mehmet Davutoglu, who stated that Kastellorizo is \""not in the Aegean\"", but in the Eastern Mediterranean, albeit he did qualify it as \""a Greek island\"". The rub is that if Kastellorizo is part of the Aegean, then it will be considered along with the other Aegean islands in any Greco-Turkish settlement, which means it will be accorded a [[continental shelf]] and an extensive [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] (which AFAIK is also the current position per international law). The Turks favour a different interpretation in which Kastellorizo is an isolated exclave and a sui generis case, and has no continental shelf. Given the fact that the first position cuts off Turkey from the E. Med and its rumoured gas and oil deposits, as well as gives Greece a common maritime border with Cyprus and Egypt (see [http:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/_PtkXMNyCIJs\/TU2I1tytuKI\/AAAAAAAAZ7w\/kd97nfLkk-c\/s1600\/%25CE%259A%25CE%2591%25CE%25A3%25CE%25A4%25CE%2595%25CE%259B%25CE%259B%25CE%259F%25CE%25A1%25CE%2599%25CE%2596%25CE%259F_%25CE%2591%25CE%259F%25CE%2596.png here]), you can see why the Turks are trying to sneak in ambiguity in the island's status. In general, there's a lot going on the past few years, with Turkey exploiting it's own rising strength and Greece's weakness to push for concessions. We now have Turkish warships regularly cruising the Aegean a few dozen miles from Athens because (and I quote Davutoglu) \""Turkey has a psychological need not to feel that the Aegean is only Greek\"". I like the Turks a lot, but comments like these make me mad, and you can imagine how others feel... So this is bound to spill over here too.
[Cplakidas]: You can read a few more details [http:\/\/www.keeptalkinggreece.com\/2011\/03\/08\/kastellorizo-whats-in-the-mind-of-turkish-fm-davutoglu-on-kastellorizo\/ here]. Cheers,
[Cplakidas]: Oh, I quite agree that Kastellorizo isn't really in the Aegean. But that is what happens when politicians appropriate neutral geographical labels for their own purposes. Nice series of articles, thanks a lot! Although my knowledge of Italian is rather poor, I can read it well enough on account of my French and Spanish ;). The title is spot on, IMO.
[Cplakidas]: No, I didn't know that... Of course, there are a few on this side of the Aegean who make similar gestures, but when it comes from the actual leadership and not fringe MPs, it is worrisome. Let's hope that in the next visit to Ey\xfcp he won't be girded with the sword of Osman...
[Cplakidas]: Hellow Yanni! I hope you are well! I am thinking about reviving the WPGR newsletter so as to get more of its nominal members to engage with WPGR, and have prepared one to be released within the next few days [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Cplakidas\/Sandbox#WPGR_newsletter here]. What do you think?
[Cplakidas]: Hello Gligan! Of course I'll check the articles, although I won't have time over the next few days. Cheers,
[Cplakidas]: Hello Doctor! I am well, and I hope you are too! I decided to restart the newsletter as a means to re-activate the almost moribund project, as well as to keep Greece-interested editors up to date on some important issues, i.e. the Kallikratis and Pumpie drives. If you have any suggestions on the newsletter or anything else, feel free to set them forth! Cheers, and best regards,
[Cplakidas]: I've checked [[Peter (diplomat)]] first, and made some relatively minor copyedits & changes. It is a good article, however it will be hard to understand for the average WP reader because much background information is missing: you should add an introductory section, dealing with the arrival of the Bulgars in the Balkans and the fights against Byzantium, the Christianization itself and the antagonism between the churches, so that the references to these are better understood. For instance, it would be unclear what relation the Byzantine Empire has with Constantinople (it is not mentioned that it was the imperial capital), and why remaining under the Patriarchate would undermine Bulgarian independence. The boyars' reluctance to accept Christianity also ought to be mentioned briefly. Cheers,
[Cplakidas]: Thanks a lot! I did make some changes, mostly where your edits changed the original meaning or where I felt the original emphasis or causal link was lost, but otherwise it was well done, especially in the lede. I also (re-)added a few more commas, for the life of me I cannot understand why copyeditors tend to weed them out that much... If you could make another check-through, I'd be grateful! Best regards,
[Cplakidas]: Well done, the intro section is perfect. I made only a few cosmetic changes.
[Cplakidas]: My comma preference comes mainly from my two native languages, Greek and German, where comma use is rather encouraged. However, I cannot say that the English books, magazines, newspapers or websites I've read over time ''don't'' use it, quite the contrary. In general, am rather puzzled after requesting a copyedit, because some changes are nothing like I'm used to seeing (the \""then\"" instead of \""and\"" for instance). Could you point me to some guidelines, so that I can read them to improve my prose (and hopefully lessen GOCE's workload in the process)? Thanks again for the copyedit, and for the wishes.
[Cplakidas]: Hello! {{user|Byzantinus}} is back with his re-addition of the D.S. Paidas work, trying to circumvent our previous objections by ostensibly using it as a source [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Synesius&action=historysubmit&diff=422470137&oldid=421436785]. It remains blatant promotion and COI however. Do you think that it should be raised at ANI?
[Cplakidas]: [[Wikipedia:ANI#User:Byzantinus and COI|Done]].
[Cplakidas]: I checked the article on Bulgarophygon, it seems largely OK. I'll check with my own sources (chiefly Shaun Tougher, although I'll try to find whatever else I can..) on the prisoners and the 30 fortresses. On the prisoners, I think we can let it stand, as that is the number reported by chroniclers. It is probably exaggerated, that's why I put an \""allegedly\"" in front of it. On another issue, the description of the battle is very short in comparison to the rest. While not unusual in several battles, I'd suggest trimming down the \""Background\"" section a bit, esp. with the view of creating a separate article on the 894-896 trade war (or alternatively, you could expand the Bulgarophygon article into an article on the war, and have the battle link to a section of it). What do you think?
[Cplakidas]: I agree, two articles are better ;) Good luck with the war articles, and take your time. BTW, on sources, you might want to check out library.nu, it has got tons of stuff...
[Cplakidas]: Hello Alessandro! I'm fine, thanks a lot, I hope the same is true on your side too :) On the issue at hand, I agree that the agenda is obvious, although carefully phrased to appear neutral-ish. I am not an expert in Islamic issues, but I'd say your point is correct: from the moment that the prayer was uttered in a building that was a focal point of one religion and was clearly intended to serve a similar role under Islam, it became a mosque. Especially since ritual trappings are rather unimportant in Islam (and Christianity, in its essence), a mosque being primarily a congregation hall. You might want to ask some other users, perhaps at [[Wikipedia:Reference desk\/Humanities]]. Otherwise, you might consider taking it up with some administrators, since a user who is practically a single-purpose account is unlikely to let go easily.
[Cplakidas]: Hah, well, I wouldn't know... Things are bad, no sign of improving yet. People are increasingly not paying their bills, as cash is scarce all-around. If you have money set aside, now is the time to come to Greece and buy cheap cars, flats and what not.  People are fed up with our politicos, for instance, I've heard of cases where ministers have gotten booed out of restaurants, but again, this has been so for the past ten years or so, and there's no real alternative. And that's the worst thing, this sense of stagnation and hopelessness. As the saying here goes, we've already it rock bottom, and have started digging...
[Cplakidas]: The crisis is still felt more than seen, and the situation hasn't yet become desperate. We're still a quite affluent nation, after all, and we still like to have a good time, eat well and spend money when abroad (Greeks and Spaniards are the best tourists, they buy everything up), perhaps all the more in times like these when the general atmosphere is rather depressive.
[Cplakidas]: Hello! In response to the FAC comments, I have revised the article in several locations where problems were pointed out. Could you please re-review it? Thanks in advance.
[Cplakidas]: Hmmm, the issue is odd. If his only concern is that a building \""is used\"" as a church\/mosque etc vs \""is\"" a church\/mosque (which is how he presents it in the latest argument), then this is a (remarkably pedantic) content dispute. I do agree that there is probably another agenda, given the previous discussions, but the issue is whether you can prove it. So far, the user hasn't violated any WP policies, so you can't refer him to [[WP:ANI]]. Your only options are [[WP:RFC]] or [[WP:RFM]].
[Cplakidas]: Well, that's one of the joys of participating in an international, open-to-all encyclopedia! Cheers, and bon courage.
[Cplakidas]: Good reply.
[Cplakidas]: Hello again. Sorry to be pestering you, but the review is likely to be closed any time now, and a reply as soon as possible would be very welcome as I might yet have time to rectify any remaining issues! Best regards,
[Cplakidas]: I've made a suggestion to end this dispute, if it is picked up, OK. Otherwise, admin intervention will probably be required. You can try ANI, although odds are that you'll be referred back to RFC for dispute resolution...
[Cplakidas]: Thanks for a quick and decisive intervention. I guess I should have moved to request a page protection after the first couple of reverts, but I hoped they (or rather he) would get the message or at least discuss. Cheers, and best to you.
[Cplakidas]: Hello Kober! Just wanted to say \""nice work\"" on making this article. Cheers,
[Cplakidas]: Also, if in future you create any other Byzantine-related articles, please consider listing them at [[Portal:Byzantine Empire\/New articles]].
[Cplakidas]: Hello Todor! Sorry to bother you again with such a request, but I am really stuck at coming up with a better hook for [[WP:TDYK#Al-Abbas ibn al-Ma'mun]]. If you have time to read it and can think of a better one, please propose it. Cheers,
[Cplakidas]: Thanks for the suggestions! Short and to the point. My failing is that I try to cram too much information into each hook... And congrats on the 120 DYKs ;)
[Cplakidas]: Hello Aldux! The article on [[Thomas the Slav]] is currently undergoing a [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Military history\/Assessment\/Thomas the Slav|MILHIST ACR]]. Although it'll probably pass as it is, I'd feel more comfortable if you could have a look at it, especially since I intend to bring it to FAC eventually. Cheers,
[Cplakidas]: Take your time, a thorough review is why I asked you for (and Malleus Fatuorum). Mille Grazie!
[Cplakidas]: Thanks a lot!
[Cplakidas]: Thanks, I'll keep that in mind. Cheers,
[Cplakidas]: That's why I asked the admins to semi-protect the page, but apparently it got lost somewhere. This guy has been at it for months, coming back every couple of weeks from a different set of IPs and on different articles, but ''always'' on the Zeibeks and Zeibekiko. Judging from the idiotic comments and insults he left here earlier, he certainly won't let go now. I'll go and request protection again.
[Cplakidas]: The book seems quite good, but it is a compilation of translated primary sources, without much in the way of commentary. I would certainly not rely on it as a principal source, and only use it in conjunction with secondary and tertiary sources.
[Cplakidas]: Hello Takabeg! On the issue of the [[:Category:Greek military personnel of the Turkish War of Independence]], I think we should move it to [[:Category:Greek military personnel of the Greco-Turkish War of 1919\u20131922]], as \""Turkish War of Independence\"" represents rather the Turkish POV on the conflict.
[Cplakidas]: Hello Todor! I've been trying to track down the various despots and add them to the article, and came upon [[Shishman of Vidin]]. The article uses Bulgarian sources so I can't verify them, but Fine does not call him a despot (although he is usually meticulous about titles). Can you check the primary source or give me a quotation from the Bulg. sources? Oh, and feel free to correct any mistakes or omissions of mine. Cheers,
[Cplakidas]: I also have trouble with the date George Terter was named despot: Fine says 1284, Guilland says ca. 1279: \""Il y avait alors, en Bulgarie, un puissant seigneur, Terter. Michel VIII Pal\xe9ologue, craignant l'ambition de ce dernier, conseilla \xe0 son gendre, le tsar Jean Asen, de le m\xe9nager et de se l'attacher par une alliance. Jean Asen donna en cons\xe9quence sa propre soeur en mariage \xe0 Terter, que Michel VIII cr\xe9a despote \xe0 cette occasion (194). Chass\xe9 de son tr\xf4ne par Terter, Jean Asen se r\xe9fugia aupr\xe8s de Michel VIII Pal\xe9ologue (195). Plus tard, Andronic II Pal\xe9ologue cr\xe9a Jean Asen despote de Romanie (196), car il avait \xe9t\xe9 convenu que, si Jean Asen ne recouvrait pas son tr\xf4ne, Jean Asen serait, en cons\xe9quence, cr\xe9\xe9 despote.\"" Personally, given the lower status of the despot rank compared to the imperial office, I find it hard to believe that Andronikos would give and even more, that George would accept it. Guilland's dating however is often outdated, so I don't really know...
[Cplakidas]: Thanks for your reply. Now, I think I'll leave Shishman out of it, unless we can get more information on him. On George Terter, I'll revert to Guilland's version, it seems more reliable. Now, Guilland also mentions that Ivan Asen was also named despot by Michael VIII. Do you perhaps have source on the exact date?
[Cplakidas]: The book says (p. 71) \""The Powers were now faced with the problem of how to dislodge the Montenegrins from Shkoder, as by virtue of a treaty concluded with Essad Pasha Toptani, Montenegro had gained control of the town\"" and (p. 72) \""Durham went on to describe the terms of the agreement made between Essad and the Montenegrins\"". I can't find anything as formal as \""peace treaty\"" either. BTW, do you have any knowledge on the issue raised at Nedim's talk page on the \""t\""\/\""d\""?
[Cplakidas]: Thanks for the info, I'll add it. :)
[Cplakidas]: BTW, as a complete aside, I have wondered for years why Enver Bey\/Pasha is at [[\u0130smail Enver]]. What do you think?
[Cplakidas]: On your second question, I am not quite sure I understand what you mean. On Nedim's comment, few people outside Turkey and Turkic-speaking countries now the difference between \""C\"" and \""\xc7\"" in Turkish, let alone that \""C\"" is \""Dj\"" and not \""K\"", but probably everyone who doesn't live in a cave knows of Texas, and most half-educated people would recognize it even if their mother language doesn't use the Latin alphabet. That's the reality of the 21st century, making comparisons like these doesn't really prove anything, it's apples and oranges.
[Cplakidas]: To be clear in this case it is about a historical article, and historical naming overrides other concerns. If we had a battle article on this, it would be called \""Battle of Chataldja\"", so it makes sense to have the \""Chataldja Army\"" too.
[Cplakidas]: I agree with the content and spirit of your edits. I won't go near the Cyprus thing, for any change means becoming embroiled for days and I am currently rather busy in RL (and that's also why I keep from any greater projects lately). I welcome any input to the 1897 war article, I've been meaning for years to bring it up to scratch... On Barbarossa, his mother was probably Greek, but the ethnicity of his father is unknown. I've seen authors speculate that his father was \""possibly\"" of Albanian origin ([http:\/\/www.google.com\/search?tbm=bks&tbo=1&q=barbarossa+albanian+origin&btnG=Search+Books]), but Greek has also a great many supporters ([http:\/\/www.google.com\/search?tbm=bks&tbo=1&q=barbarossa+greek+origin]). The problem is that \""Greek\"" hee can be used to mean simply \""Christian\"". In the same vein, he was certainly not an ''ethnic'' Turk as implied by the article, but rather a \""Turk\"" in the sense that he was born a Muslim and was not a convert.
[Cplakidas]: IIRC, it was meant as a reconnaissance in force and a show of force: the Greek high command (many of whom were recently re-installed royalists and not the more experienced Venizelists) severely underestimated Turkish strength and ability and intended to deliver a blow to Kemalist forces, advance to Eskisehir and improve Greece's military and diplomatic position prior to the upcoming London Conference. BTW, if you want a good English-language account of the war from a Greek and Allied perspective, I heartily recommend ''Ionian Vision'' by Michael Llewellyn Smith.
[Cplakidas]: Athanasios Frangos or Frangou (you can transliterate \""ng\"" with \""nk\"", but the former is more correct for modern Greek), Major General and commander of 1st Division. Born 1864, died 1923. I'll try to find material and write something on him.
[Cplakidas]: Here we go, in the order you gave above, except for the ones already linked: [[Georgios Valettas]], [[Dimitrios Dimaras]], [[Periklis Kallidopoulos]], [[Nikolaos Rokas]], [[Kimon Digenis]], [[Militiadis Kaibalis]], [[Panagiotis Gardikas]], [[Vasileios Kourousopoulos]], [[Petros Soumilas]], [[Dimitrios Papanikolaou (general)|Dimitrios Papanikolaou]], [[Georgios Gortzas]], [[Nikolaos Kladas]], [[Dimitrios Theotokis]], [[Stylianos Gonatas]], [[Andreas Kallinskis]].
[Cplakidas]: Hello! There's a new article on the well-known paddle ship proposal from De Rebus Bellicis, copy-pasted from [http:\/\/terraromana.org\/navis\/Forum\/viewforum.php?f=153 here]. The author presents its existence as fact, whereas every book I've read says that this was a paper project along the lines of da Vinci's designs. Your expertise on ancient technology is needed!

[Cplakidas]: You mean \""Bir sey de\u011fil\"" I suppose?
[Cplakidas]: I assume you refer to the Ottoman Macedonia thing. I hadn't seen it else I would have opposed it. The difference between the region and the nation-state is not artificial. But I think that first we ought to clear up what the [[Macedonia under the Ottoman Empire]] is about. So far it reflects its origins in covering mostly the RoM, with some later attempts to introduce elements from the wider region of Macedonia. The result is a plain mess.
[Cplakidas]: I agree with your concern. Personally, I find it absurd to back-project modern entities to a historical era, especially when these modern entities have no historical analogue or predecessor, unlike Egypt, Syria, Greece, Albania etc which are more or less well-defined geographical areas. To me, \""Macedonia under the Ottoman Empire\"" should be about the region, which was too polyglot, multi-national and multi-confessional to be confined in the straitjacket of modern national historiography. In the same way, \""Ottoman Greece\"" could in some respects be perceived as far larger than modern Greece (Greek communities in western Asia Minor and the northern Balkans) or narrower (\""Greece proper\"" being essentially the pre-1881 Greek state, where the Greeks were the overwhelmingly predominant population and which is the scene of most purely \""Greek\"" historical events during Ottoman times). \""Ottoman Albania\"" could for instance also include parts of modern Greek Epirus, just as \""Ottoman Bulgaria\"" would include parts of Macedonia and Thrace, etc.
[Cplakidas]: Don't shoot please, I merely added the categories for those people who were in the Category:Greek people from Konstantiniyye, which was deleted yesterday. Since Wikipedia uses Istanbul for the post-1453 period, that's where they belong. I mostly agree with your points on the city's name (to be fair, the Turkish name Istanbul was popularly used already long before 1453 and was semi-official during Ottoman times), but I really don't have either the mood or the time to start trying to overturn this practice . If you feel up to it, go ahead, but a word of advice: calm down. Not every problem here is the result of a conspiracy to hide or alter history. Sometimes it is the result of an awkward compromise or a simple bad call or an unchallenged POV that has become entrenched through long usage. These things can be changed and corrected, and that's one of the great things about this place. To do that however, you have to be patient and calm, you won't win any support by launching accusations of deliberate falsification of history at the first sign of a disagreeable edit...
[Cplakidas]: \""Please explain why the category \""People from Constantinople\"" has been redirected to \""Constantinopolitans\"". I did it because the latter category was older by far and covered the same area. I \""implemented\"" no change, I merely re-categorized some people according to Wikipedia practice. On the division between Byzantine and Ottoman Constantinople, I told you it was not my decision.
[Cplakidas]: Sigh... I told you I mostly agree with you on this, but that the other side has a valid point too, and that this division has been established by others long before I or you came along. I really don't understand what the \""new editors\"" argument is supposed to prove: if the new editors don't go about it in a completely pig-headed way (i.e. constant reverts, failure to regard warnings and messages by other users and replying by all-caps messages \""ITS REAL NAME IS CONSTANTINOPLE\"" etc), no, they won't be blocked. And if they are pig-headed and rude enough to get blocked, then they deserve it, whether they argue that \""ISTANBUL IS CONSTANTINOPLE\"", \""CYPRUS IS GREEK\"" or that \""SOLUN IS MACEDONIAN\"" or \""CHAMERIA IS ALBANIAN\"". I don't care what their national POV is, a troll is a troll. Anyhow, your problem is with the established division between Constantinople an Istanbul, and that a) has little to do with the categories, which follow the established division and Wikipedia guidelines and won't change until that changes b) has nothing to do with new editors (who usually don't go about adding or removing categories, unless they are experienced former users, i.e. sockpuppets, c) has nothing to do with me as I was not and am not responsible for the existence of this division an d) has everything to do with what you perceive to be the truth and want to rectify. I repeat: go to [[Talk:Istanbul]] and have it out there. You are shouting at the wrong person here.
[Cplakidas]: On the first question, the former. The troops regarded it as a last-ditch effort to win them over. On the second, no, Pterotos' family was indeed in Michael's hands, and that was a factor in his decision to defect. I didn't make that clear enough.
[Cplakidas]: One does not need to write in all caps to be \""shouting\"". At least I perceive your tone as being a bit aggressive. If I am wrong, I apologize. If there were a vote on the issue, I'd vote for \""Constantinople\"" until the end of the Ottoman era at least, but only because that was the common name in international usage and is registered that way in numerous treaties etc. The \""official name\"" argument is true, but when you read everyday Ottoman-era documents or literature, not government correspondence or imperial edicts, the name is usually \""Istanbul\"". And anyhow, \""official names\"" don't carry much weight here against common usage. In the article body, there's always the expedient of linking \""[[Istanbul|Constantinople]]\"" where necessary.
[Cplakidas]: Thanks a lot, I'll check it out later today.
[Cplakidas]: Hello Ealdgyth! There's been quite a lot of work in the article over the past couple of weeks, and I think your comments have been largely addressed. Could you re-check it? Thanks a lot!
[Cplakidas]: The Egyptian template is not an apt comparison for two reasons: first, it follows a universal and well-established scheme by adhering to division by dynasties, and second, it covers three millennia, so some division and grouping of rulers by periods is absolutely necessary. The Ottoman template on the other hand is '''''too''''' detailed, with divisions that sometimes cover less than 15 years and that are shorter than the reigns of the contemporary sultan. The old five period division was OK in this regard, but the scheme you are proposing is not. To speak plainly: when you use groups in a navbox, you use encompassing categories, not specific single-item terms. A group of one entry is no group. Have a look on how other ruler navboxes are structured. What is more important however, is that there is no indication that your proposed division of the sultans is used in any source. In conclusion, with navboxes, simplicity is the best.
[Cplakidas]: I am aware of the problem, and that is the main reason I reverted to the \""simple\"" version without periods. I am quite willing to reinstate the period division if we can find some good and reliable information about the dates. I am away from most of my Ottoman history books currently, so if you have access to some good sources and can point me to them, it would be nice. BTW, this discussion should probably take place in the template talk page s that other users can participate as well, and so that there is a record of the relevant decision-making process there.

[Welshleprechaun]: Owain, your edits are becoming more and more obstructive. Firstly, please do not continue to add ''United Kingdom'' to the ''Newport'' page. It is generally accepted that just Wales (or Scotland, England, NI) suffices. Secondly, how dare you revert a merge that has been practically universally agreed upon by consensus. If you have a problem, you raise it on the talk page. Thirdly, please do not let your traditionalist views affect your edits, as they have been raised on a few occasions at the Welsh Wikipedians discussion board.
[Welshleprechaun]: Whether the information is correct or not is not the issue, we're talking about the content issue, specifically you contradicting WP guidelines which exist for a reason. Also you had chance to particpate in the discussion about the merge, and even if you had, the consensus was to merge, and since the merge no other editor has disagreed. If you have a problem with it, take it higher rather than reverting as this act is disruptive.
[Welshleprechaun]: Is there any particular reason why you are renaming Newport County seasons from the standard naming convention? It seems rather futile and destructive.
[Welshleprechaun]: I've had to revert many of your edits to categories. Brecon is now in Powys, not Brecknockshire. Please stop making destructive edits according to your support for the preserved counties.
[Welshleprechaun]: As a result of your name change to this template, the link to edit the template on each page of the template are broken. Please change the name of the template on each of its articles to reflect its new name and correct this, or I shall move the template back to its original name. Thank you.
[Welshleprechaun]: On each page that is linked on the template, such as [[Brains Brewery]], go to the template, and click 'e' for edit. Watch what happens. This is is because the template is written on that page with a capital I, but you have changed it to a small i so it doesn't work. Therefore you must change {{tl|Economy and Industry of Cardiff}} to {{tl|Economy and industry of Cardiff}} on every page which has the template to correct the link.
[Welshleprechaun]: You need to make the same edit that you did to [[Welsh National Opera]] to every article that has the templae otherwise the link will be broken.

[Wōdenhelm]: Well where ya been man? We could still use some additional contributors!
[Wōdenhelm]: There's actually a few reason I specifically chose the word Heathen: besides it being the native English term (from Anglo-Saxon ''h\u01e3\xf0en''), it's also the very vocabulary that would have been used by the people in question, as well as how in modern times, \""Heathen\"" is coming to mean specifically Germanic paganism, to distinguish it from other forms (Saami, Baltic, Roman, etc). Finally, the article is relevant to modern \xc1satr\xfa Heathens. Also, I feel that the name should be capitalized, as it is now very much a ''name'' as opposed to a mere description (as well as capitalizing it would give equal respect to both factions. consider how much ruckus would be caused if an article on race were to have ''White'' but also ''black''). \u2014<font size=\""3\""><font color=\""000000\"">
[Wōdenhelm]: Yeah. While it's not universal, it's growing more in that direction. The term ''Heathen'' was made \""bad\"" by Christianity, as it was this term which was used in English biblical translations (simply the author using native English speech). As a side-note, \""lust\"" once simply meant \""joy\"" as it does in other Germanic languages, but was \""demonized\"" by means of the bible as well. In any case, ''Heathen'' is being \""taken back,\"" especially in the last 10 years or so, but this \""taking back\"" began in the 1970's. Take it easy. \u2014<font size=\""3\""><font color=\""000000\"">

{unknown-1182},False,"[{unknown-1182}]: Just adding that in response to your charge that the article was dominated by \""little references to obscure sources\"", I am now working on expanding the section on the major philosophical views of politics.

{unknown-1756},False,"[{unknown-1756}]: Hey Saber, do you want me to [[WP:HISTMERGE|histmerge]] ''Australia'' with [[User:Saberwyn\/HMAS Australia II]]?"
Steve,False,"[Steve]: Hi. Sorry to see the trouble you're having with this. If you want my advice (and maybe you don't!) I think you should consider withdrawing the FAC. Yes, I know you think that would make no sense because of the multiple '''support''' votes, but based on nothing more than my (admittedly only recently acquired) experience at [[WP:FAC]], I don't think the article will be promoted this time around; the delegate who reads the FAC page to determine whether it will be promoted, archived or left open will give significant weight to the opposition because it has come from those experienced at reviewing featured article candidates, and because\u2014though you may disagree\u2014the '''oppose''' statements are based on a coherent, legitimate argument rather than \""[[WP:IDON'TLIKEIT|I don't like it]].\"" So, I do think the most prudent, least stressful course of action for you would be to withdraw the FAC, take a look at the recommended sources at your leisure, include any relevant details, and resubmit the article in a few weeks. Please don't let the frustrations you've encountered this time put you off FAC for good; I'm sure that if you follow this advice, the next time will be far less stressful. All the best,
[Steve]: I understand your frustration. FAC can be one of the most stressful areas; by design it exists to hold our work to a higher standard than most of the rest of Wikipedia can match\u2014and this is how it should be. But what I will say is that I don't think anyone was saying the article required a complete rewrite; Laser Brain seemed to be suggesting that other experts on the topic weigh in with an opinion on the best sources to use and \""have them review a working outline.\"" I don't know what that means exactly, but it doesn't look like a rewrite request to me. The principal objections ''are'' resolvable; you indicated that you could access these books given enough time. I feel sure that if you withdrew the FAC and took some time to look over the books then the opposition would disappear; as it stands, I'm 100% sure it won't be promoted while their concerns are outstanding, but RelHistBuff [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates\/Vasil_Levski&diff=279108209&oldid=278913807 indicated] a willingness to support, and the other editors are honourable reviewers who I'm sure would be happy to reconsider their votes if you pinged them upon renomination. I'm sorry if I seem like I'm repeating myself, perhaps that proves just how much of a shame I think it would be if you were soured to Wikipedia and to FAC because of this experience.
[Steve]: Hi; I'll echo the comments, and not just because of your kind words and invaluable input at [[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates\/Changeling (film)\/archive1|''Changeling''{{'s}} FAC]] (I forgot thank you, btw); we can never have too many good reviewers who are willing to spend time thoroughly and calmly engaging with nominators, especially those who feel slighted by a well-considered oppose. I hope you'll stick around. All the best,
[Steve]: Hi there. I noted your comments in the edit summary for your removal of the entries from that section; to clarify, [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Films\/Archive 26#Benefit of Allmovie|the discussion]] was not primarily about using Allmovie in the way that Erik implemented at ''Fight Club'', but one over its suitability as an external link. The discussion petered out with no real conclusion\u2014with no support, but also no consensus objection to such a use. I invite you to participate at [[Talk:Fight Club (film)#\""See also\"" section]], where your thoughts on Erik's intended use of the section would be appreciated. All the best,
[Steve]: Ha, just noticed [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Psycho_%281960_film%29&diff=307043368&oldid=307039985 this]. I'm trimming the section right now and that was literally the ''first'' thing I removed. :-)
[Steve]: Hi; I considered your comments carefully, and despite initially disagreeing, I eventually saw the wisdom of your suggested cuts. I've worked through all of them now, so I'd be happy for you to take another look. Only in a couple of spots did I retain tidbits you suggested I cull, but given the 11kb of information I've removed today I think I can justify them if you still disagree. It was only when I started editing this morning that I realised how bloody thorough your review had been, and how much thought you put into the suggested cuts. So I really must thank you again for taking the time to look at the article. As an aside&nbsp;... I hope you realise this is all your fault (indirectly, at least). Several years ago you convinced [[User:Erik|Erik]] about the necessity of including themes and interpretations in our film articles; he convinced me, and I guess I overcompensated for fear that someone would criticise the article for not being a thorough enough treatment. So, thanks for that. :-) All the best,
[Steve]: Hi. I'm not at all fussed whether the building and the bridge appear in the lead; I can certainly see both sides, but this is Charles' article, so I'm happy to let him decide. I only moved your addition because it went against the recommendations of [[WP:LEAD]]; because the lead is intended as a summary of the entire article, it shouldn't contain information not in the article body. I also felt that how locals now feel about the aesthetics of a building merely named after Minton was too trivial a point to make in a summary of what seems to have been a busy life. However, I hope you aren't put off editing the article because of my tweaks to your contributions; you've added some good and useful content. All the best,&nbsp;
[Steve]: You're welcome; the article has appeared on my radar a couple of times in the past, so I know a hell of a lot of work has gone into it. I'm hoping to review at some point this week in between other things; in the meantime, I'll plug away at the (seemingly very minor so far) prose issues before leaving some comments on the FAC page for stuff I can't resolve myself. All the best, and good luck.&nbsp;
[Steve]: Hi. I'm sorry I've been quiet since seeing my concerns resolved. In part, because of a heavy real-life workload, but truth be told, mostly because [[User:DCGeist|DCGeist]] brought fresh concerns and I was waiting until he finished looking through the article before revisiting. I've been quiet on the FAC-review front for a while, so I'm still a bit rusty; most of what Dan brought to your attention I should have spotted, and indeed would have a year ago. Similarly with the [[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates\/Sherman Minton\/archive3|Sherman Minton FAC]] referenced above; minor issues were raised\u2014after I lodged my support for its promotion\u2014that I should have caught (though in that article's case, I'm still OK with my stance). So, although it doesn't help you any, I hope you can see why I lack the confidence to offer my full support right now. ''However'', all is not lost; Dan is an excellent editor, with many FA contributions to his name, and though he's sometimes a tough reviewer, experience shows that he is willing to put work into articles not his own to push them over the line (barring major issues unrelated to prose quality\u2014and I still do feel that the ''TCM'' article is close on that front). Here's hoping you return to see it promoted. All the best,&nbsp;"

[McDoobAU93]: Hey there ... thanks for updating the article to include the new WebGL version. However, after installing the game, I do have some questions about how we're presenting it. The game is referred to as ''Angry Birds Chrome'', and also includes a \""beta\"" tag in the title graphic. That makes me wonder if it's exclusive to Chrome for now, and upon full release will be available to other WebGL browsers. That would of course be speculation on my part, but at the same time the game (which itself can be considered a [[WP:RS|reliable source]] for article content) is kinda clear on who's behind this. What do you think?  --'''
[McDoobAU93]: Therein lies the question. From my own admitted [[WP:OR|original research]], I tried installing on Firefox 4, which (supposedly) can run WebGL, but a pop-up appeared saying that Firefox didn't yet support the Chrome Web Store. Again, since it's OR, I'm not going to add it to the article.

[McDoobAU93]: Kiefer is an admin, and is in the loop, fortunately. Both KS and I are trying to figure out why he's so insistent on his word usage, even when such words don't exist in standard English. He has received a final warning for his edits, and in truth he hasn't made any disruptive ones since that warning, so it leads me to believe he's finally gotten the message.  --'''
[McDoobAU93]: Hey there, and thanks for offering up your comments to the anon IP on his changes to the article for [[Virtual Console]]. Also, thanks for catching the typo, that appears to have been made [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Virtual_Console&diff=next&oldid=439569066 here]. There is a difference between Kiefer's typo and the changes this IP wants to make; I'm sure that Kiefer would also thank you for catching his typo, as would I had I made it. However, the words that this IP keeps wanting to add simply don't exist in common English. When questioned about them, he gets defensive and even questions our intelligence, instead of explaining exactly why his terminology (?) is better. Fortunately, he's apparently gotten down off his high horse in terms of the article, with no more edits since he received the final warning.  --'''
[McDoobAU93]: Kinda failed in that regard. He dared me to file a report on him, and I said there was no need since he hasn't made any edits in that article since he was given his final warning. In that, I'm satisfied. He can do whatever he wants in other articles. He tries that stunt in an article I'm monitoring, however ....  --'''

Clindberg,False,"[Clindberg]: Yes, the changes are quite irritating.  I hadn't noticed the LPGA changes, but this user (or users) have been changing [[Ladies European Tour]] names for almost a year now, on and off.  Look at the page history :-)  The IP address changes frequently, but they all seem to come from Australia.  It started last June 1, right when Golf Punk magazine became the title sponsor for one of the events (timing may have been a coincidence).  Most of the time the sponsors are more-or-less correct, but these full names go well beyond even what the ladieseuropeantour.com schedule has.  They have also changed the external schedule link on the LET page to a Japanese-language LPGA of Japan schedule (this past february) and xtube.com (just recently).  I also recall changes to the [[Evian Masters]] page, but I had not noticed these IPs changing other articles recently, but obviously they have.  I'm really not sure what can be done, especially since the IP changes so much (and between entirely different network blocks too).  The name-changers have never once discussed anything on a talk page, as far as I've seen.  The name changes on the LET page have been nearly identical every time.  Very odd situation.
[Clindberg]: Ah interesting, I hadn't seen that the LPGA changes started even earlier than the LET ones (though they are more persistent on the latter).  I was never sure if it was really vandalism... at one point they changed the LET schedule link to the Japanese-language LPGA of Japan schedule... at that point I was wondering if this was a non-English speaker.  Other changes like using formal names for players though were also odd... and the recent linking to xtube.com pretty much shows that it was vandalism.  It is still pretty odd, and I'm not sure there is much that can be done except continue to revert.  Maybe short-term semiprotection on days they are active; these articles usually don't need to change that often.  Thanks for the help though ;-)"

[Faycal.09]: Regarding the addition of berber, I would be very happy if we could add that, only it would be complicated because as you may know the berber is a national language but not official and there is no media (press) Berbers in Algeria.

[Roleplayer]: Hi, just to let you know, the Oxford dictionary reference provides the first record of Aberdeen as being called ''Aberdon'' in 1187. --
[Roleplayer]: The article is good, but it makes a common mistake in etymology: it doesn't consider what the place used to be called, just what it is called today.  Finding another early reference to the city name that confirms ''Aberdon'' or suggests ''Aberdeen'' is the key to this. --
[Roleplayer]: I've just seen that [[Aberdeen]] and [[Etymology of Aberdeen]] both state that the name was originally ''Aberdon''. --
[Roleplayer]: See the links I provided above, which give a much more detailed explanation of any that I could, and if you still have queries I would suggest bringing them up at [[Talk:Etymology of Aberdeen]].  [[Aberdeen]] also provides ''Richard Stephen Charnock. Local Etymology: A Derivative Dictionary of Geographical Names. Houlston and Wright.'' as a reference for ''Aberdon'', which is one that I don't have access to. --

Amchow78,False,"[Amchow78]: I do not see any reason for the photo I created and uploaded to be nominated for speedy deletion.  I clearly stated that I took the photograph myself @ an Argos home game in 2005, and that I hearby release it to the public domain.
[Amchow78]: I now see what you mean.  What I'll do, then, is make a note about the nature of [[Cliff Washburn|his]] signing with the Texans, combined with a citation to avoid further confusions.
[Amchow78]: Hmm ... I am not too familiar with the concept of the reserve\/future contract, but I think I got the gist of how it works based on the Buccaneers' website.[http:\/\/www.buccaneers.com\/news\/newsdetail.aspx?newsid=4976]  It says that the upcoming season doesn't officially start until March.  I'm assuming that it means that there is a freeze on officially signing free agents until then, except for a select few that meet the criteria of being signed to this type of contract. The contract would then decree that they will officially become a member of that team when March comes around.  If my assumption is correct, then that would explain why Washburn is still listed as an active member of the Toronto Argonauts.  Did I pretty much get the concept of the reserve\/future contract correctly?
[Amchow78]: The format I went with is in accordance with the terminology used on the [http:\/\/www.argonauts.ca\/page\/transactions_68611 Argonauts' transaction page] with respect to those three players, who happened to have signed reserve\/future contracts with NFL teams.  I would ''assume'', then, that the same would also apply to the other players that you noted.
[Amchow78]: Yeah, I did that just based on my interpretation of the criteria stated on the asterisk legend.  It makes no difference to me which way it is showed to be honest.  If you prefer it to be presented in accordance with your interpretation, I've no problem with it."
SaxTeacher,False,"[SaxTeacher]: Thanks for adding to this article. However due to the length of the article, and the varied opinions of different players around the world, we need to leave out information about which player uses which reed, or what you think the \""standard\"" reed strength should be.  I removed this and put the great link you supplied (mouthpieceheaven.com's page of the set-ups of famous players) to the \""external links\"" section at the bottom of the article. \u2014
[SaxTeacher]: I explained in my comments on this topic (on the [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Talk:Saxophone#Discussion_on_Reeds_section saxophone talk page]) that a discussion of which player uses what type of reed doesn't belong in the saxophone article. It belongs on your personal web page, or blog, or a forum about saxophone players, of which there are many on various web sites. The article is about the instrument itself, not about specific players or your opinion on the optimal reed strength.

[SaxTeacher]: Thank you for noting the vandalism to the article and reverting it. However, the user had made two separate bad edits, and you reverted only the second one. I think this is known as \""flocking and stacking\""... when you go to revert, take care to be sure you are reverting back to the last unvandalized version.  Best, \u2014
[SaxTeacher]: I haven't been able to figure out how to use AWB to change the decade links to music-specific decade links in music articles only. I will see if I can find a way. It would help if the names of the music-specific decade articles weren't so incredibly long (tedious to type). Thanks \u2014

[SaxTeacher]: Again, welcome - appreciate your contributions! \u2014
[SaxTeacher]: While it is certainly a good idea to discuss the article with other editors, keep in mind that the person who added the most material is not its \""author\"" and doesn't \""own\"" the article, so you can go ahead and make edits\/corrections to articles concurrent with your discussion on the talk pages.

[SatyrTN]: Hi, Number 57!  The bot is working on a [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Judaism\/Categories|list of categories]] provided to me by [[WP:JUDAISM|WikiProject Judaism]].

[SatyrTN]: Hi, Blainster!  The [[User:SatyrBot|bot]] is using the page [[User:SatyrBot\/Current project]] to work from - that's where it finds the current WikiProject banner it's working with, as well as the categories it needs to traverse. In general, the categories only stay on that page for a day or so until the bot has run through them, then I replace them with the next batch of categories.  Sorry if that's annoying, but it's the best way I've found to work.  It lets the project review the categories before the bot runs them to make sure they're correct - and remove any that aren't right.

[Chengwes]: Thanks for looking at the article. I made all of the suggested changes, with the exception of moving up the 'personal' section. Where do you suggest I move it to?
[Chengwes]: That's great to hear. I hope to work with you more in the future.
[Chengwes]: I've beefed up a lot of Hakim Warrick article in the past couple of days as well. It's missing an image, so I know it's not up to GA status, yet, but what else can be improved in the meantime? Thanks again for your help.
[Chengwes]: I added a personal section and beefed up the lead. Someone else suggested I add more to the professional section, although that's kind of hard, since in his two years, it's not like he's lead his team to the NBA finals, or even been a full-time starter. What do you think? Thanks for taking a look at it.

[Zoe]: http:\/\/shilllicker.blogspot.com\/  See the March 30 entry.  He added the \""Update\"" paragraph after I asked him how he can claim to be reformed if he still retains the invitation to vandalism on his blog.  The rest of that day's entry, both above and below the Update paragraph were the original parts of it.
[Zoe]: I see you have re-added the link, which I have re-removed.
[Zoe]: I'm sorry your RfA failed.  I suggest more activity in the community, such as [[WP:AN]] and [[WP:ANI]], [[WP:AFD]], [[WP:DRV]] and other high-profile places where other users can see your name and get to know you.
[Zoe]: Hi, any possibility that you can rethink your deletion of this?  He seems to be at least marginally notable, based on the article.  It did read like a copyvio, but I couldn't find it online anywhere, and it needs rewriting, but the person himself seems notable.
[Zoe]: Are you really saying that you support Monicasdude's accusations of racism?
[Zoe]: What's up is your completely inexplicable backing of trolls like Monicasdude and POV warriors like Deecevoice.
[Zoe]: I'm sorry, I have to strongly disagree with you, Joshua, that Monicasdude is acting in good faith.  Good faith does not remove PROD tags on flimsy reasoning and then accuse others of bad faith for bringing the article to AfD, which is what is ''supposed'' to be done.  Good faith does not involve accusing everybody who disagrees with you of being a vandal and a racist.  Bacchus, about your comments on my Talk page:  admins are not supposed to be anything more than another editor, according to the rules of adminship, so there's nothing anywhere that makes me a role model.  I'm an editor who wants to follow the policies of Wikipedia, and when those policies are ignored, in fact, flouted, then there's something wrong with what's going on, and something needs to be done, but if everybody just looks away, then where are we?  Why do we have policies, if they can be ignored just because a minority of \""voters\"" on an AfD or DRV can decide to ignore them?
[Zoe]: Compare http:\/\/www.lib.virginia.edu\/clemons\/RMC\/exhib\/93.ray.aa\/Elements.html - which is one of the articles Deeceevice uses as proof of her claims - against what she ''says in the article'' it says, and you'll see she's putting her own spin on things.  I have said all along that there should be an article about the Robert Farris Thompson book she uses as supporting documentation, but it shouldn't be used as the sole proof of her allegation.
[Zoe]: Also see CoYep's arguments at [[Talk:African aesthetic]], and Deeceevoice's inability to address them without incivility.
[Zoe]: If you have no objections, I'm going to list it at [[WP:DRV]].
[Zoe]: Thanks, I agree with you that it needs a lot of work.
[Zoe]: Not a prob, I took care of it.  :)
[Zoe]: If it's so notable and important, why are they unable to prove it?
[Zoe]: Forging another user's signature is a blockable offense.  Please don't do it again.
[Zoe]: Thanks for the smile.  :)
[Zoe]: OK.  Just don't make a habit of it. :)
[Zoe]: Why is there a big Image:40px-ButtonStop.png in the upper right hand corner of your Talk page?
[Zoe]: I've deleted Wikipedia:SCAG.  Please quit trying to create watchdog agencies for admins and participate in the creation of an encyclopedia.
[Zoe]: ''This is the Operation Watchdog page. We are working on the bad apple rating for administrators. To further that goal we are compiling a [[Wikipedia:Operation Watchdog\/List|list]] of administrators who misuse their power.'' is not \""collecting statistics\"".  Go write an article.
[Zoe]: What are you planning on doing with those statistics, and why do you need a group to do it?
[Zoe]: I would need to know what purpose the statistics would be used for before I could say whether I would agree.  I would also need to know why you feel the need for these statistics.  And why you can't just get on with the business of writing articles.  I have no interest in maintaining a hostile relationship, but you don't seem to actually be interested in creating an encyclopedia, but instead in creating an adversarial relationship with admins.
[Zoe]: Why not wait until the arbcom expresses a need for such information?
[Zoe]: Eh.  I have more to do than worry about what people think of me.  Thanks for the heads up, though.

[Zoe]: and now see [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard\/Incidents#More pleasantries from User:Repmart]].
[Zoe]: I'm sorry to see you go, but I fully understand.  I was gone for over a year before I finally got my steam back up and decided to re-enter the cesspool that parts of Wikipedia has become.  If you never come back, take solace in the good work that you did here.  If you decide to come back, you will be welcomed.
[Zoe]: Any more of this hoax crap at [[Aria]], [[Knowlton Estate]], Eyre\/Heller garbage, and you will be '''''permanently''''' banned from editing.  Is that clear?
[Zoe]: Your edits are hoaxes.  You know it, I know it, we all know it.  You have been warned, no matter what userid you post under.
[Zoe]: Nothing on that template says that they are a system administrator on another system.  That template should only be used by Wikipedia system administrators, and to do otherwise is being an imposter (imposture?)
[Zoe]: I took it to [[WP:AN]].  If there's consensus to let non-WP admins use it, I'll unblock him.
[Zoe]: Welcome to the list of rouge admins.  :)
[Zoe]: Thanks for looking out for my talk page, I get plenty of vandals, but I reverted, it wasn't that vandalistic, and I did reply to the person.  Thanks, though.  :)
[Zoe]: Not joking in the slightest.  If you can't be bothered to make a real article, create it in your user space and move it into article space when it has more than an infobox.
[Zoe]: See [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28proposals%29&diff=prev&oldid=91029114 this].  He was posting it all over the place.  I've left two warnings and if he does it again, he'll get blocked, but expect more Cplot sock puppets.  I love Cplot's protestations of innocence on his Talk page.  :)
[Zoe]: I have indicated on [[Wikipedia talk:Requests for arbitration\/Seabhcan\/Proposed decision]] that, should you be desyopped, I will immediately re-nominate you for sysop.  Would you accept the nomination if I did?
[Zoe]: This is wrong.

[Dlyons493]: I agree it should go through AfD - it's just one of thousands of similar type stories.  I suppose apparently originating in the 13th century is its main claim to fame, but let the community decide whether it's worth keeping or not.

However, this condition ''does'' exist, and is sourced at the article [[Diphallia]], i have recreated the page as a redirect to Diphallia and hope that if you choose to delete ''that'' page, you AfD it first. -
[Zappernapper]: even though it was listed at Uncontroversial Moves, I have moved [[Pok\xe9mon move]] back to its orginal page at move'''s''' per the exceptions at [[WP:Name]] regarding pluralization.  The article discusses the moves collectively, and the requester, I beleive, did not understand the circumstances in which a wikipedia article may accurately be pluralized. -
[Zappernapper]: Because this review has been placed on hold an abnormal length of time (+15 days), I was hoping you could finalize your judgement in order to help with the [[WP:GAN\/R|backlog]] at GAN.  I understand the review process is time consuming and have noted your health codition, I appreciate your efforts in improving the encyclopedia, and have asked for a consensus on the [[Talk:Who Would Have Thought It?|talk page]] in lieu of an immediate response from you.  Cheers :)  -
[Zappernapper]: the same goes for [[Carmen Rodr\xedguez]] (+13 days). -
[Zappernapper]: Because this review has been placed on hold an abnormal length of time (+11 days), I was hoping you could finalize your judgement in order to help with the [[WP:GAN\/R|backlog]] at GAN. I understand the review process is time consuming, and I appreciate your efforts in improving the encyclopedia :) -
[Zappernapper]: isn't it up to Awadewit to decide what he does?  you don't need to wikistalk my notes to prove your point...  I supose then that a friendly reminder that [[William Blake]] has been up for review for 25 days is out of line?  My only suggestion is that if you feel you don't have the time right now, to remove your name from the under the nomination so that others might be more inclined to adopt it. Again, these are only meant to be helpful notices for editors in order to expedite the GA review process. -
[Zappernapper]: as i said before, i understand, and hope that you are doing better - i don't want to stress you over something that's supposed to be a voluntary effort -
[Zappernapper]: like i have already said to Geometry guy, reviewers don't suddenly [[WP:OWN|own]] articles, and the guidelines at [[WP:GAN]] recommend closing a review after seven days.  ''of course'', these are just guidelines\/suggestions so if you feel this is a case which would be facilitated by extending the hold time, then go right ahead - it's about improving the encyclopedia after all. Happy editing! -
[Zappernapper]: I would appreciate you not saying my actions are \""myopic\"", that's a bit deragotory and unconstructive.  I would ''love'' to see this article reach GA, and then FA.  But to nominate an article that still has cite tags was poor planning.  It shows that you failed to do Step 1 in the [[WP:GNGA|guide to nominating good articles]].  Rather than characterize my criticisms as \""nitpicky\"", take the time to work on them.  you'll find that you can learn more about writing a good article and it will help you in the future when you've gone on to tackle other subjects. -
[Zappernapper]: perhaps my review was a giant monster that scared someone away, but it wasn't meant to be, and i would suggest to that editor that they not concern themselves with commas and periods but instead work on the problems with prose and coverage.  Everybody has their own things they like to do on wikipedia, and i'm sure you could still focus on the other aspects of the article that need work.  I have gone ahead and contacted editors at [[WP:TYPO]] and [[WP:GCE]] to help with those \""nitpicky\"" details so hopefully you can instead work on the coverage issues and tracking down sources for your attributed claims (Humane Society, Smithsonian, [[Bob Barker]], and [[Drew Carey]] - checking out those articles might be a good starting point).  I suggest you also try seeking help with the other reference problems in the review. -
[Zappernapper]: I look forward to seeing your substantive changes (specifically adding information on the topics i noted were missing), and hopefully you can address some of that \""Problem prose\"".  One editor has already come forward and started making changes (although s\/he failed to notice any punctuation errors... bah), and i have perosnally gone through and made quite a few fixes.  I do hope though, that you still strive to meet all the GA requirements.  Idiosyncrasies aside (perhaps my distaste for parenthetical prose in articles), following the MOS and standard punctuation\/spelling\/grammar is important to an article because it elevates it to a point beyond your typical hack-job.  It lends credibility and authority to the article - are you more willing to trust something riddled with bad speling and punctuation, or something that looks like the people writing it were able to put two sentences together correctly? Again... I eagerly look forward to an expanded article -
[Zappernapper]: (extra ranting, read if you like) To be honest, it is difficult to keep up with all the conversations on just WP:V, WP:NPOV, and WP:OR, that to be asked to also be aware of the minutiae of their supporting guidelines is a little inhuman.  And we could both attest to many editors on here who would feel that coverage in a reliable source has satisfied WP:V, so guidelines be damned - i generally challenge the notion of that wording, and even WP:N, as being widely accepted (remember the hue and cry when it was upgraded from essay?).--&#65279;
[Zappernapper]: actually, the reasoning for using those other terms is ''because'' i feel character lists are not indiscriminate.  I was more referring to a fictional database that decided to list every fictional character ever created, or databases like IMDB being used as the only 3rd party source to say actor X played character Y (or as the only source for info on episodes).  However, if a third-party were to write an exhaustive encyclopedia on a fictional subject and that source was deemed to be reliable (i.e. it was truly encyclopedic in nature and not full of speculation or original fiction by the editor) i think it should satisfy our needs to be a [[WP:5P|specialized encyclopedia]], and we could write articles based heavily on that source - although still not exclusively.  I don't tend to think articles should be written if they can only be sourced to one book, site, etc. I think that making the claim, \""Coverage from tertiary sources does not constitute evidence of notability...\"" is too bold and would never have agreement, it sounds too contradictory to the sentence from WP:V that our threshold for inclusion is verifiabilty.  i find it only necessary that as a guideline we recommend articles to not ''rely'' on some kinds of databases and directories as the only source because it calls into question that actual notability of the article. --&#65279;
[Zappernapper]: you're arguing that the subject does not merit inclusion (is not-notable) despite it's non-trivial discussion in a reliable third-party source only because that source is tertiary?  while our other guidelines already say one should not depened on such sources for high levels of detail, they do not cast them off as irrelevant for establishing notability. --&#65279;
[Zappernapper]: i am wondering what phrasing you are interpreting as saying, \""...tertiary coverage on [its] own do[es] not impart any notability...\"" - please keep your quote relevant to tertiary sources.  it seems to me that WP:OR is discussing ''content'' and ''prose'', not suitability of inclusion. --&#65279;
[Zappernapper]: i wouldn't characterize my actions like that at all since i made concessions and retooled the template.  if you had been able to provide a proper example, your point would have been made, but you didn't - and even then that doesn't mean a better solution doesn't exist, ala the OTHERCRAPEXISTS arguement. --&#65279;
[Zappernapper]: i challenge your assertion that Mewtwo had a voice actor in Pokemon Red and Blue as the template as-is currently claims. --&#65279;
[Zappernapper]: i never said pokemon was unique for the aspect of voice acting... i just noted voiceacting might be better handled with the different template.  pokemon is still unique in the fact that these characters gained their notability ''outside'' of games as well.  All these examples you've given are still characters that became notable through their video game appearances alone, while it could be argued that the video games gave rise to the cartoon in japan - a single year divides them, and here on the english wikipedia, if we look at the pokemon franchise in the english speaking world, the two media were released within the ''same'' year.  These other characters you say pokemon are ''just like'' have ''not'' played a major role in a cartoon running for 12 years... --&#65279;
[Zappernapper]: i have commented on anarchangel's talk page and am just letting you know, happy editing! --&#65279;
[Zappernapper]: the merge proposal, by admission, is not a discussion, it's meant to be a vote which is a \""very bad thing\"". --&#65279;
[Zappernapper]: btw, it wasn't vandalism, i was previewing a template from my sandbox that i needed to make sure was working properly in the normal talk space... i just accidentally hit save instead of preview, and you got to the edit before i could undo it. :) --&#65279;
[Zappernapper]: it's nice of you to contact me again and i am happy you are working well with AL2TP and Kung Fu Man. I personally do not enjoy working with people who define consensus as a vote, and are not interested in any viewpoints contrary to their own. it would appear that wikipedia is moving away from trying to be an encyclopedia about everything, and i have learned that it's best to not waste what spare time i have writing pages of arguments that go essentially ignored. cheers! --&#65279;"
Purplehayes2006,False,"[Purplehayes2006]: Please let me know what's your point to say my edit on Jenna Haze's article is spam. I'm adding a new award she just won. I'm not using as source the Fame Registry site since it is a new annual Award. I gave a 3rd party reliable source (XBiz) giving coverage to the Fame Registry Awards. If you don't know it, XBiz is one of the biggest sites for adult news.
[Purplehayes2006]: Yeah it is a press release, but that fact doesn't change that XBiz is giving coverage to the Awards and they are not related to the Fame Registry site.
[Purplehayes2006]: I know what a press release and XBiz are, and we both know that XBiz and Fame Registry are different sources. Yes it is a press release so Fame Registry is being XBiz's client in this case, but it is XBiz who decides the deal to accept to post a press release or not. By posting this press release, XBiz is also accepting give coverage to the Fame Registry Awards. Also you call XBiz a \""flak\"". XBiz is a legitimate reliable source for adult news, you like it or not. And Btw, you labeled my edit not only once but twice as spam. I'm obviously not spamming anything. That's just not right of you."

[BoogaLouie]: Obviously you're watching me for blockable offenses and I don't want to make any false moves.

Have a nice day :-) --
[BoogaLouie]: My idea was to get input from editors in the Iran wikiproject as it seemed there weren't many other editors in the [[History of Islamic Republic of Iran]] article (besides people checking spelling and such) in recent months besides myself. I had no reply from KneeJuan - the person who was deleting what was as far as I could tell a good despription of the IRI - and I thought people familar with Iran would be in a better position to judge how suitable the text in question was to the article, than something like '''Editors willing to provide assistance'''. --
[BoogaLouie]: I am happy to discuss content being reverted, in fact that is what I was trying to do [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:KneeJuan&diff=289507550&oldid=288953482 here]. You'll also notice that following my attempt to engage KneeJuan in constructive dialog I did ''not'' rvt any of his two dozen or so [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Special:Contributions\/KneeJuan recent edits] (with the exception of his talk page so I could talk to him) which include highly questionable rvts of my stuff. A large part of the problem is KneeJuan's rvting without discussion in talk pages. --

[BoogaLouie]: <BR>The parties that did not voice their disagreement did not because they have dominated the editing and like the article the way it is.

[BoogaLouie]: This is unbelievable. My \""overall behavior\"" \""editing tendentiously and passive-aggressively\""?????   I've been bending over backwards to play by the wikipedia rules - avoiding edit wars, explaining my problems with the crude, unencyclopedic edits on the talk page. Have you looked at Kurdo's and Skywriter's edits?  Do you think perhaps some other editors have been editting not just passive-aggressively, but aggressively??   --

[BoogaLouie]: For example, I had no idea what this complaint above refered to until I remembered being called [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Talk:1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat#Lead BoogaLuise], not by you, but by Kurdo.

[BoogaLouie]: ''... He recently filed a complaint against me for a typo, not spelling his pen name correctly.''

I originally only created a redirect from Takfir wal-Hijra to [[Jama'at al-Muslimin]], but then I found a lot of sources on  Takfir wal-Hijra from old versions of the article, so I created a separate article. Do you object to the dividing of the article? --

Gap9551,False,"[Gap9551]: Apart from that, I think your edits were rightfully reverted. The stat of 10 consecutive semi-finals means that Lendl made at least the semis in 10 consecutive Grand Slams (he did so from US Open 1985 to AusOpen 1988 -- note that AusOpen 1985 was held in December). It does not mean that Lendl made at least 1 Grand Slam semifinal during 10 consecutive calender years (this number is 11 as you correctly find). So I think there is a simple misunderstanding going on, thanks for your efforts in improving the article.
[Gap9551]: Hello, since you have been involved in managing the articles [[List of multiple Olympic gold medalists]] and [[List of multiple Olympic medalists]] a lot longer than I am, and are in favor of splitting at least the former, perhaps you would like to comment on this again on the respective talk pages if you feel the need to do so. I just added a split template to each of the pages, but I'm not sure how long to wait for response before actually carry on with splitting, since you didn't get much response on your earlier call for opinions. Thanks.
[Gap9551]: Thanks, splitting completed.
[Gap9551]: Hello, I am a bit confused about the categorization of [[Pan Pacific Swimming Championships]] in Category:Swimming records (via [[Template:Records in swimming]]), additional to [[List of Pan Pacific Championships records in swimming]]. I agree having the template there makes sense, but perhaps the category shouldn't automatically follow, as the page is about a swimming competition? The same can be said about [[FINA]]. Alternatively, if we include both template and category, wouldn't it be consistent to add these to other tournament articles, such as [[Swimming at the World Aquatics Championships]] as well? Thanks in advance! By the way, my compliments on your contributions on records, among other things.
[Gap9551]: Great, I looked into the code and changed the template so that the Category isn't automatically inherited to the articles having the template. Only four of the articles listed in the template didn't include Category:Swimming records explicitly, so I added it to those.
[Gap9551]: Hi, good to know, thanks. I'll fix this on some more articles then, so those are no longer a bad example.
[Gap9551]: Hi, ok let's go with GDR then. Nice catch by the way on the incorrect gold medalist. Hopefully not too many of such errors still exist...
[Gap9551]: Hi, I noticed you removed this template from a couple of 2011 WAC articles such as [[Open water swimming at the 2011 World Aquatics Championships]]. Wouldn't it (in general) be convenient to have a template in all articles which are linked to in the template? And if this is not the case, why don't you remove the template from all the equivalent articles in the template, such as e.g. [[Diving at the 1986 World Aquatics Championships]]? (Of course you can ignore that last question if you were still going to remove those).
[Gap9551]: [re:] That would be a very nice solution. I agree there is no need to directly link from Diving 2003 to Swimming 1982 etc, but a template per discipline would be convenient to have.

[Patar knight]: I was just wondering why you removed [[User:CAWUEgypt]] with this edit [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Usernames_for_administrator_attention&oldid=260467895], saying \"" Thanks for leaving a notice on the talk page; you didn't need to tell UAA that you were doing so.\"" I thought such promotional usernames were blocked under [[WP:USERNAME]], CAWUEgypt is obviously connected to the [[Center for arab west understanding]], whose article the user keeps on creating. Should I have given this evidence when I first presented this user to WP:UAA, or would this have better been left to other methods? Thanks, --
[Patar knight]: But `Accounts that represent an entire group or company are not permitted, and this is clearly an inappropriate username. Also, the user is unlikely to follow my warning anyways, as they have simply disregarded numerous deletion notices, and recreated their promotional page on their group. While, some of these promotional usernames could end up being productive editors if given the change, this one probably wouldn't. So in this case, I believe a block is justified here. Other cases, like [[User:Ohelpee]], another user I reported (though at that time under a different name) were more accepting of the policies, and thus deserved some leniency. --
[Patar knight]: Sorry, but this case is obviously a blatant example of violation of the username policy. The user has firstly, broken the username policy, and then proceeded to write mostly inappropriate articles, ignoring the numerous warnings that other users were putting on his talk page. A significant majority, if not all of the other articles that the user has worked on have all been related to the group that they are promoting. Just go to [[Sawsan Gabra Ayoub Khalil]], [[Cornelis Hulsman]], [[Center for Intercultural Dialogue and Translation]], [[Arab-West Report]], and other articles and search for CAWU or Center for Arab Western Understanding. All of their edits are connected to this group in some way, and it is pretty clear what their intentions are. While I concur that some dialogue with the user is desirable in some cases at [[WP:UAA]], this one is not one of them. --
[Patar knight]: Okay, so there were only two warnings. ''Touch\xe9'' on that one. The first was the signing one, and the second about removing <nowiki>{{hangon}}<\/nowiki> notices (both can be seen [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:CAWUEgypt&oldid=250632459 here]. However, the other notifications were about his articles which had been either speedily deleted or deleted at AFD. I know that creating speedily deleted articles is not a blockable offense in itself. However, the user's violation of the username policy, compounded with their creation of several self-promoting articles (which were the ones speedily-deleted) despite previous notices on our notability policies, leads to a justification of a block for this user, as it is entirely a self-promotional front for the CAWU. --
[Patar knight]: You're right. I've wasted too much time arguing about something that stopped being a problem two months ago, losing sight of what Wikipedia's goal is: to build an encyclopedia. While some of my points would've had merit while the user was still active, any action now is unnecessary unless the said user returns. Now my best course of action is to go over the articles that the user created, and edit them\/nominate them for deletion, as befitting Wikipedia policy. --
[Patar knight]: Seconded. Edits like [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:24.243.125.227&diff=348259686&oldid=348253117] don't help your situation, and only rile up the other side. Step up and take the high road and talk. --
[Patar knight]: In the future, pages such as [[My First Added Page]], which just contain text that says \""This is my first created page\"" or text to that effect, can be tagged under [[WP:CSD#G2|G2]], a criterion created just for such test pages. Happy editing. --
[Patar knight]: {{done}} This request has been processed. Happy editting. --
[Patar knight]: The subject of your article was clearly not suitable for inclusion. Being real is no threshold (I'm real and so are you, but we don't deserve articles), and running for a Council seat in a city of less than a quarter-million, and losing, with no other notable accomplishments, doesn't merit someone a Wikipedia article. Compare for example, the amount of candidates who have pages in the [[Ottawa municipal election, 2010|latest Ottawa municipal election]] for a metropolis of around 1 million people. Out of 25 candidates, only 5 have articles (1 was a provincial minister and former mayor, 1 was the former mayor and a prominent business man, and the other 3 were all long-time politicians, of which one is also a noted author, another was a mayor of a (now) suburb of Ottawa, while the last was an member of the provincial parliament). The other candidates are like your Thomas Scott Adams, they ran, didn't make it, but seem to have done little else of significance outside of the city. I'm sure that Thomas Scott Adams is a very agreeable person, but he doesn't meet our [[WP:POLITICIANS|notability guidelines for politicians]], unless you can prove he has received massive amounts of press coverage. Sorry, --
[Patar knight]: It didn't meet our [[WP:N|notability guidelines]], and gave no credible reason why it might meet those guidelines. --
[Patar knight]: As a rule of thumb, losing candidates in relatively minor elections who don't receive extraordinary press coverage (e.g. Christine O'Donnell-esque) generally don't have articles, unless they've done something else of note. Sorry, --
[Patar knight]: It isn't helpful. The tradition of Santa giving coal is already mentioned five times in the article , including one reference in the lede itself, so adding it is repetitive. It also brings undue weight to this rather minor tradition which isn't there in all cultures that have a Santa in them. Lastly, IMDB is not a reliable source, so it's not cited.--
[Patar knight]: I have not restored the article, per my reservations about that outlined in the e-mail I just sent you. However, the text is harmless, so I sent that to you, with the caveat that you do not repost this article. --
[Patar knight]: Sorry, it seems that another user removed the <nowiki>{{wi}}<\/nowiki> template from the page, and made it seem like a test page, since now it only consisted of a non-existant template. I think that your best bet would be to make a disambiguation page at [[Da bomb]], add a short explanation of the term, add all the search results with that in its name (there were at least 3 when I just searched), and then add [[Template:Wiktionary]] to that disambiguation page.--

[Shawnc]: (From [[Talk:Bruce_Lee]]) I've wanted to read that Chinese Pacific Weekly article for a long time, and you're the first person I know of who has seen it. Could you possibly get a digital copy of it? I could probably do a translation of it for interested readers.
[Shawnc]: The articles I tagged did not cite references or external links, hence the tag of \""unsourced\"".  Please refer to [[Wikipedia:Verifiability]]: \""When adding information: The burden of evidence lies with the editor who has made the edit. Editors should therefore provide references. Any edit lacking a source may be removed.\"" The accuracy of all unsourced article are in question of violating [[Wikipedia:No original research]], such as in [[John Seigenthaler Sr. Wikipedia biography controversy]].
[Shawnc]: (Fairuse tag added.)
[Shawnc]: Please refer to the discussion at [[Template talk:R with possibilities]]. The template was poorly named and will be renamed unless new objections are raised.
[Shawnc]: There was a concensus on renaming the template, so could you please join the discussion there? Thanks.
[Shawnc]: Mr. Simpson, let's discuss the proposals at [[Template talk:R with possibilities]].
[Shawnc]: Hi Abu badali, you commented on [[Image talk:Tatsuya Kawajiri.jpg]] that the image does not qualify under fair use because it does not satisfy \""No free equivalent is available or could be created that would adequately give the same information.\"" I asked what this means at the [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Mixed_martial_arts#Fair_use_images|WikiProject]] because I can not find a free image for it. What do you think about other similarly copyrighted images such as: [[:Image:Fedor.jpg]], [[:Image:Mirko Filipovic.jpg]], [[:Image:Wanderlei de Silva.JPG]], [[:Image:Matt-hughes.jpg]], [[:Image:GeorgesStPierre.jpg]] and so on -- do you think they are fair use or not?

[Ohiostandard]: Good of you to say so. I understand: I know from experience that this can be a ''very'' frustrating place sometimes.

[Ohiostandard]: Hi Cliff. Good call on reverting edits like [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Intravenous_immunoglobulin&diff=prev&oldid=383480909 this one] to [[Intravenous immunoglobulin]]. You'll notice from that diff that both 138.162.8.58 and 138.162.8.57 were involved; they're obviously the same person, as was the consensus from a previous ANI thread. This guy has a 3-year history of vandalism, and his IP addresses are very, very stable. He just came off a 2-week block. I'd say it'd be worth trying to get him blocked again, if you have the energy to do so, just based on his edits to Intravenous immunoglobulin from multiple IPs. Blocked not only for unconstruvtive editing, but also for IP socking, in that he \""tag teamed\"" to try to get the edits to stick, from two different IPs. If you don't choose to try to get him blocked again, then would you please look in on the contributions history for these two IPs every few days if you possibly can, as I'm doing myself? He's just been such an active vandal that he really should be permablocked, but admins here are just so reluctant to do that re an IP, even when there's such strong evidence that it's a static one. ( I doubt the Navy Network has IPs in random rotation, like some civilian ISPs do ... I'd lay money on it, actually. ) Anyway, this guy is a menace, so I'd appreciate it if you'd try to keep \""eyes on\"" too, if you choose not to seek to have him blocked for a longer period at this time. Thanks, &nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">
[Ohiostandard]: Say, if it's not improper to ask you ( and I don't think it is, since there's no dispute under discussion ), would you be able to take a look at a policy question I posted at AN? I had trouble getting to the question I was trying to ask, trouble formulating it exactly and concisely, but it pretty much comes down to this example:<blockquote>Can an editor use \""his daily 1RR\"" revert to delete some content added by an opponent an hour ago, and then '''also''' walk through the article like a shopper pushing a cart down a grocery aisle and just remove (or restore) whatever additional content he chooses to suit his POV? Merely because that additional content was added (or removed) a year ago or a month ago, and is thus not under current dispute? Doing so might violate other policies, but does it violate 1RR or not?<\/blockquote> The thread, entitled, \""What's a revert?\"" is [[Wikipedia%3AAdministrators'_noticeboard#What.27s_a_revert.3F | here, at AN]]. I wouldn't ask, except that I think people might have become frustrated with the discussion becasue my initial phrasing of the question was a little vague, and I'm a bit concerned with the possibility that no one will reply to the reformulated question, the one I should have asked in the first place, before it rolls of to archives. Thanks again, &nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">
[Ohiostandard]: Oh, gosh, I'm sorry. I'm afraid I ''hadn't'' noticed, or I wouldn't have asked. Nevermind my request; it's small potatoes in comparison. Thanks for your work, very much. Best, &nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">

[Ohiostandard]: Hi, AniMate. You may have noticed from my ANI post that I agree with you that the image of Saeed's mutilated corpse \""crosses some lines we shouldn't be crossing\"", which I thought very well said. Now I hope I'm not being officious or inappropriately interfering, here, and I understand that you must necessarily be far more aware of all the issues that surround this controversy than I am. But it's my impression from reading between the lines that at least some who want the image ''in'' the article might be able to hold their noses and go with the idea of a prominent external link... The pic doesn't belong in the article, in my opinion: Besides the argument I made at ANI to that effect, it also seems to me that we should exercise some degree of respect for the subject's loved ones, who will no-doubt see our article at some point. But I also feel the article would be truncated and incomplete without recourse to the photo, especially since it has strongly influenced current events in Egypt. ( See [http:\/\/www.almasryalyoum.com\/en\/news\/making-police-state-battle-ismailiya-khaled-saeed here], for one example. ) So, with respect, I wonder if you, also, might be able to live with a prominent external or subpage (if a free image can be found) link, provided it was clearly labeled with a warning as to its graphic nature? I didn't want to ask you at ANI because, being so \""public\"" a forum, I felt that might put you on the spot, a bit. But could you, do you think, tolerate such a compromise at all, assuming people on the other side of the issue could also do so? Thanks,&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">
[Ohiostandard]: Hi, Graeme! I just wanted to mention that informed input from ''all'' users is welcome at ANI. I'm not an admin, either, but I do contribute there frequently, trying to provide helpful information and (as I hope!) a calm\/respectful take on issues presented. It's my impression that maybe half to two-thirds of the contributors there on any given day aren't admins, and don't have any personal involvement with the issues they comment on. Non-admin participation has always seemed welcome there, to me; no one has ever objected in the least. ( On the contrary, actually: I'm somewhat embarrassed to mention it, but our illustrious founder once made an extremely positive comment about a lengthy analysis I posted there, and another user gave me a barnstar for my analysis of a different issue at ANI. ) I do try to think carefully and understand the relevant issues before I express an opinion that opposes that of any admin, of course, but it's been my strong impression that my participation has been entirely welcome, as I'm sure your thoughtful contributions would be as well. Best regards, &nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">
[Ohiostandard]: Point taken re readers versus editors, and I dislike the idea of deviating so markedly from the MOS, as well. Still, I feel pretty strongly that we do a disservice to our readers by not making the comparison between the \""before\"" and (the admittedly horrific and repellant) \""after\"" prominently accessible: The smiling image of the young man that we have in the article currently seems to me to inappropriately downplay the crux of the issue that has so contributed to the fury over his death. That's just my opinion, however, and my inclination in this is to defer to all of you who have been discussing this at length... Hmm; could you live with the idea of some prominently featured in-article mention of the EL, e.g. a sentence just below the current picture that said something like, \""See external links section for link to image of ...\"", however that could best be phrased? That wouldn't be a very elegant compromise, I admit, but it would seem to address what I see as the strong arguments on ''both'' sides of this contentious and difficult issue. What do you think? Could you tolerate this as a compromise solution for the conflict? Thanks, &nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">
[Ohiostandard]: Hi, BigK. Just wanted to observe that when you find yourself telling another user to \""Stop edit warring\"", as you did [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Austrian_School&diff=next&oldid=412036826 here], it's probably a good indicator that it's time to back off for a while, or at least to follow the steps in the [[WP:DR|dispute resolution]] process. Edit warring doesn't happen in a vacuum, in other words: it takes two. Best, &nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">
[Ohiostandard]: Hi, Rick. I know it's not required by policy, but would you please review [[wp:indent]] and try to remember to conform to it when you post to a thread? I noticed that [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Talk:Right-wing_politics&diff=next&oldid=414778287 you just posted at \""flush-left\"" again], after I'd just pointed out, above, how that introduces ambiguity. It also makes it impossible for subsequent posters to use indents to make it clear that they might be replying to a post that was ''above'' and ''preceded'' yours. I'm sure it was just due to habit, but I'd be very grateful if you'd try hard to break that habit, since it interferes with understanding who is replying to whom in a thread. Btw, I saw your now-self-reverted ref to the OED at ''Talk:Right-wing politics'', and hope you'll restore it once Manning completes his review, assuming the RfC remains open for its normal 30-day interval. It was an enlightening ref, and certainly from as authoritative and unimpeachable a source as one could wish.

[Ohiostandard]: I don't much care for [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Talk:Right-wing_politics&diff=next&oldid=415392088 being called pedantic]. If your genuine motive is to try to help end a conflict you're not involved in then it's probably not the most effective strategy jump in and belittle the parties to it. Even if you can't bring yourself to take someone else's dispute seriously, you can be certain that the people involved in it do, and that they'll respond more favorably to being addressed respectfully than otherwise. No hard feelings, though, this one time. Cheers, &nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">
[Ohiostandard]: I've never been much impressed when someone says \""I'm sorry\"" just before he repeats an insult; the construct has always seemed disingenuous to me. I spent at least an hour preparing for that refactor, and an hour performing it. My only motive was altruistic, to make the page easier to read and to preserve our ability there to present and discuss the two topics at issue separately, a desirable and valuable goal. When I was ''almost'' done, Collect reverted that two-hours work after he saw that I'd (perhaps temporarily) removed one half of one sentence of his that was nothing more than sniping at TFD. It wasn't remotely connected to improving the article, not in any way. I find it impossible to believe that you wouldn't object to that if you'd been in my shoes, and that you wouldn't have objected if your actions and motives had been misrepresented subsequently. \""Quite frankly\"", you'd do better to keep the pretensions to moral superiority that you've indulged in this matter to yourself. &nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">
[Ohiostandard]: What, rhetorical questions? Now you're just being pedantic.:P &nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">

[Ohiostandard]: Cyclone, I've had Off2riorob's talk page watchlisted for a while; I posted there some time back, and just didn't take it back off. I went there just now, to remove it from my watchlist, and found you canvassing his assistance in this matter. I'm going to assume that asking him to jump in on your side of the conflict over this was just a moment of lunacy because you were upset about this. He had the sense and integrity not to do so, but please don't do anything like what you did [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk%3AOff2riorob&action=historysubmit&diff=425185940&oldid=425029466 here] and in subsequent edits to his talk page again; I'm sure you have to know better than that. &nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">
[Ohiostandard]: There's no need to explain or defend your actions: If I'd wanted to make an issue of this I would have proceeded differently. You can take or leave the suggestion as you wish, but I think it could be to your benefit to ask an admin or other user you trust for an opinion about whether [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk%3AOff2riorob&action=historysubmit&diff=425185940&oldid=425029466 this], and your several subsequent posts to Rob's talk page were proper under our rules about canvassing or not. I think doing so could go a long way toward preventing trouble in the future. Heck, ask Rob what he thinks, whether he'd recommend that it's okay to repeat posts like that in the future. Perhaps he'll say, \""Oh, yes; that seems perfectly fine to me,\"" but I think it would be worth your while to get some outside opinions if only, as I suggest, to prevent trouble for yourself in the future. No reply necessary, unless you just want to, and no talkback necessary, either, as I always watchlist pages I've posted to. Cheers, &nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">
[Ohiostandard]: So if you feel there are still open issues that need discussion, you can and should (a) ask Berean to revert his edit, or, if he's not online, and because threads at AN\/I roll off to archives after 24 hours of inactivity, (b) just revert it yourself, citing the passage from [[WP:RTP]]. I'm undecided about this; I may do it myself before you see this message; it's my opinion that \""closures\"" like that should almost never be done at AN\/I where, almost by definition, there ''are'' \""recent heated discussions\"" and where trust is often pretty thin on the ground. If you'd like to reply, feel free to do so here; I've temporarily watchlisted this page. &nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">
[Ohiostandard]: Well, other users had less than 2 hours to comment before Berean shut down discussion. I probably would have commented myself, if it hadn't been hatted. In fact, I \""unhatted\"" the thread just a moment ago, and was about to post here to tell you so, when I got an edit conflict and saw your 07:51 post, just above. So I immediately self-reverted the \""unhat\"" at AN\/I; it would have been silly for me to re-open it if you didn't want it re-opened. Anyway, talk it over with Magog, and maybe the IP who also wanted further discussion; I'll look in on the section before it ages off to archives, and will comment there if I see it's re-opened. All I'd suggest is that if you do re-open it, that you might want to use [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard\/Incidents&diff=prev&oldid=425627666 the same edit summary] I did, to help prevent an edit war ... which would be rather unseemly, at AN\/I, imo. ;-) Best, &nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">
[Ohiostandard]: Okay, I've thought about this for a while, and I want to comment at AN\/I myself. I don't know if anyone else will, but Berean's quick closure made it impossible for us to know. That was improper, imo, and I've decided to re-open the thread myself. It'll probably just roll off to archives, but even just one user still wanting to comment is sufficient reason to remove the hat. &nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">
[Ohiostandard]: These last two DYks are purely speculative, of course, but I find it hard to believe that this is what ArbCom had in mind. That is, I find it hard to believe that they intended Mbz1 should just go on creating \""Jew\/Israeli good, smart, entrepreneurial AND Muslim\/Arab bad ... or gay, or people [[Sayyida_al_Hurra|who became pirates \""to avenge themselves on the Christian enemy\""]], or [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Mukhayriq&diff=next&oldid=425568891 treacherous killers of Jews], and getting them exposure on the Main page via DYKs.

[Ohiostandard]: [[Yawn]]. &nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">
[Ohiostandard]: Okay, that's a reasonable answer; thanks. As far as improving the articles myself, though, I've spent a ''great'' deal of time on just two of her articles, all the time I could afford. I spent what I estimate was probably 15 -20 times longer learning about Richard Wagner than the creator of the now-deleted ''Richard Wagner's First Love'' article did by creating a copy-and-paste article from hopelessly flawed expired-copyright sources, and I believe I've examined the sources quite recently, and in the recent past, too, for another of her articles ''far'' more carefully than she ever did, and improved that article correspondingly, as a result. It's my opinion that that kind of very basic research and NPOV review should be done before an article hits mainspace, though, and shouldn't be imposed on the community. But you're of course perfectly right that it's not your obligation or role in life to have to prevent that from happening. &nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">
[Ohiostandard]: And even if some very provocative or offensive statement ''does'' hold up to painstaking research, I don't think Wikipedia's main page is the place to present such information. I'd prefer that the main page seem welcoming to readers regardless of their religion. I'd prefer we ''welcome'' readers via our main page before we ''insult'' their deeply-held beliefs in our articles, that is. ( If we insult them first, we might not get the chance ;-) YMMV in all good faith. Now, I believe, in deference to our host, I'll invite anyone who wants to continue this discussion to post a response to my talk, unless Gatoclass pipes up and says he wants it to continue here. Best, &nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">
[Ohiostandard]: Why target a school bus at all, and especially an empty one? I think they were trying to send a ''very'' serious message to the Israeli command structure, saying something like, \""If you target our leadership again we will blow a school bus to pieces that's ''not'' empty of kids. All we'd have to do is fire 50 metres earlier.\"" Kind of like in the movies when someone sends a photo to an enemy of that enemy through the \""crosshairs\"" of a rifle scope. Or like in ancient Chinese ninja stories where the assassin just leaves a dagger on the bedside table of an enemy while he's asleep. A way of saying, \""If you keep trying to hurt me, I can hurt you too.\"" That's my theory, anyway; I don't see anything else that makes sense. The kid who was killed wasn't expected to be on the bus. I don't think Hamas intended to kill any kids; I just think they wanted to send the message, \""Leave us alone, because we ''can''.\"" My guess is that they were probably really, really disturbed to learn that the bus had a kid on it. All speculation, of course, and I know we can't use any of it in the article, but nothing else I can think of explains the facts in a way that makes sense to me, and I wondered what someone else might think... I didn't mean to write a novel, though; delete this whenever you feel like it. Cheers, &nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">
[Ohiostandard]: Gato, do you have any ideas about how to most productively address this? &nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">

[Ohiostandard]: The idea that Hamas evidently put forth that the shooter didn't know it was a school bus does seem pretty ridiculous to me, though. &nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">
[Ohiostandard]: Based on having seen a photo very similar to the first one in news stories and on the linked-to Israeli government site, I concluded that the first photo is authentic. The second one probably is, too; my only concern is that the Internet Archive did seem to indicate that the second photo with the broken \""source\"" links wasn't actually present on the web site for Israel's Canberra embassy anytime recently (could be mistaken, though) and that there ''was'' a photo of a ten-year-old injured boy on the flikr web page in 2009, although only its description is archived, not the actual photo. But in any case, there do seem to be some questions re the licensing of both photos that need sorting. If you don't know how to address this, or don't want to be troubled to do so, let me know, and I'll try to figure out another way to clear up the confusion. Thanks, &nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">
[Ohiostandard]: Certainly. I posted about content here because I understood from one of your comments that you were engaged in a re-write, and I see you have a copy in your userspace that I presume represents a work-in-progress. I mention that only to ''explain'' my motivation, not to ''argue'' in favor of discussion here, of course. I don't know how to proceed to try to clear up the apparent (?) copyright issue re the photos, though, but I'll try to figure that out on my own. &nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">
[Ohiostandard]: Please stop making changes unilateral, undiscussed changes on a large scale to the [[Hamas school bus attack]] article, and participate in the talk page discussion to try to achieve a consensus-based article.

[Ohiostandard]: Anyway, it seemed odd that a very pro-Israel editor would be interested in creating an article about a PLO policy statement. But as I read more of the article he created, and compared it to the PLO's ''actual'' 10 point plan, it seemed to me that his article constitutes nothing more than a [[wp:soapbox|soapbox]]. It's so utterly biased from the get go that it can't possibly be used as a baseline from which to start. My guess is that the subject is notable, but the current article is irretrievably bad. <u>The slate should be wiped clean<\/u> so editors can the opportunity to create an article that fairly represents its subject. Care to do the honors, if you know how? &nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">
[Ohiostandard]: Oh, also: I think [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=PLO%27s_10_Point_Program&redirect=no every] [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Ten_point_program&redirect=no one] [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=10_Point_Program&redirect=no of] [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Political_Programme_of_the_12th_Palestine_National_Council&redirect=no these] [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=10_Point_Program_of_the_PLO&redirect=no five] redirects needs to go, as well; I know even less about redirects than I do about starting an AfD, though.

[Ohiostandard]: Hmm. I won't comment on your interpretation of the gist of my comment, but I will say that you've misunderstood why I wrote that I think Hamas was probably very disturbed to learn that they'd killed the boy. I wrote that because, having accomplished what I believe they were only intending to ''threaten'', they would have realized that they'd have Israeli artillery fire raining down on Gaza in short order as a result. And it did, of course: 19 people were killed and 45 - 57 (depending on which source you read) were wounded. And since you like the word \""terrorist\"" so much, do you really think the mother and daughter in Gaza who were killed, or the ten year old boy weren't \""terrorized\"", I wonder? That's a rhetorical question; if you really want to answer it we should meet on my talk page, out of consideration for our host, here. &nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">
[Ohiostandard]: Hi. Just wanted to let you know that a new proposal has been made in [[Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard\/Incidents#Summary_of_conclusions_and_proposed_resolution|a thread you contributed to at AN\/I]] concerning the possibility of prohibiting a user from initiating actions at AN, AN\/I, or WQA. Thanks, &nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">
[Ohiostandard]: You just missed it, Atama; easy enough to do, given that the exchanges now span four pages: here, the SPI, Betsy's talk, and now, since Ohana brought it there, AN\/I. In his first entry to Betsy's talk page, Ohana wrote, \""[http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Betsythedevine&oldid=430912445#Wikipedia:Sockpuppet_investigations.2FNoCal100 Since Red Stone Arsenal and you have opposing POV at Start-up Nation, I really believe that you use the sockpuppetry case to try and assassinate his character. Therefore, I am cautioning you not to abuse the process and use SPI as a venue to silence editors with other POVs.]\"" You might like to take a look at the AN\/I thread ([[Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard\/Incidents#Third_opinion_requested|link\/]][http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard\/Incidents&oldid=430933541#Third_opinion_requested permalink]) for further information if you're interested. &nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">
[Ohiostandard]: Hi, Count! I didn't mean to disparage your 0rr suggestion at AN\/I at all, and I hope I didn't give that impression. My reply was driven by a couple of things. One is that I know from experience that the user in question goes through articles doing what he calls \""trimming\"", meaning that he expunges any info that doesn't sit well with his POV. This isn't generally information that has been added recently. Some admins, perhaps most, wouldn't call that a \""revert\"", although the definition of \""revert\"" would make it so. We'd all have to constantly watch out for that, have to monitor every single edit this user made to catch that. Since in both this and his former account, he proved himself, imo, one of the most dedicated fringe POV warriors the project has seen in a good long while, none of us really wants to do that; it would be a very time consuming task. Please understand, btw, that it's not the POV that's a problem, we all have that, but the abuse of so many other editorial policies to promote that. Excuse me for replying here rather than at AN\/I; I wanted to reply at some length, and didn't want to write a novel ;-) there. If ''you'd'' like to reply, you can do so here, as I've temporarily watchlisted this page. Best regards, &nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">
[Ohiostandard]: I regret having to re-open the thread, but I just didn't think I had any choice in good conscience. Even if that angered you, as I expect it must have, please understand that I wasn't personally motivated in any way. I'm going to post to Ohana's page myself, as I saw you did, as well, and see if I can help sort this misunderstanding. I say \""misunderstanding\"" because if I were an SPI clerk who'd received the third request concerning a single user in a short time, I might get pretty hot, assume the worst, and say something regrettable myself. If you'd like to reply, feel free to do so here, as I've temporarily watchlisted this page. Best regards, &nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">

[Ohiostandard]: Sorry to post a novel here; delete it at will, of course; it's your talk page. But I really hope you'll accept the possibility that this drama really was just the unfortunate result of mutual frustration and misunderstanding, and will be able to de-escalate this. I hope it won't seem silly for me to say so, but if you're not married, I can assure you in all sober earnest that it would be a great chance to hone a very necessary skill for that blessed state. ;-) Please do look in at AN\/I, if you can do so without getting knots in your middle. Best regards, &nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">
[Ohiostandard]: Anyway, I wanted to just let you know of this, and to explain that my hope is that (a) Ohana might yet change his mind, or, if he doesn't, (b) community consensus will nevertheless allow the comments to be struck through so they're not thrown in betsy's face every time she files an SPI for the next three years. Some people in the I\/P area are just mean, I'm sorry to say, and would certainly repeatedly cite Ohana's comments on various pages, despite the seeming consensus at AN\/I that they were uncalled for. It's disturbing, but the rule really does seem to be, \""fling whatever mud is you can put your hands on, maybe some of it will stick\"". To be clear, though, I do not make these comments about any individual editor. If you want to have a look at the section again, [[Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard\/Incidents#Was_character_assassination_accusation_called_for_or_should_it_be_struck-through.3F|here's]] a link. Thanks again for your comment, it was insightful and helpful. Best, &nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">
[Ohiostandard]: And thank you for your reply. I see considerable merit in what you're proposing; I'm not sure the Heim Theory article would fly, though; I'm pretty sure people would say it falls within the \""broadly construed\"" part of his pseudoscience ban. I actually like this guy very much, on a personal level; I even gave him a barnstar for his work on [[Reaction Engines Skylon]], because he'd earned it, but also in part to encourage him to keep working on space articles, where he pretty much stays out of trouble. And he returned the favor giving me a \""random acts of kindness\"" barnstar, which was quite a surprise. I feel pretty bad about this, actually, but he's so POV driven and has been so unable (not unwilling, I think) to keep his promises that I think it's going to have to be a site ban, eventually. I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to stand mentoring him, as much as I like him personally, truly, and I don't think anyone else would be willing to either. Mann Jess tried under his ( Terra Novus' ) former account name, for something like eight months as I recall, and it was no good. He vanished when all the citizens were out with torches and pitchforks as AN\/I and then showed up as Terra Novus as a \""clean start\"" three days later. If he hadn't disappeared previously he almost certainly would have been site banned. It's really a shame; he's bright, articulate, polite, and an absolute POV disaster. I'd still buy him a pint, though. &nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">
[Ohiostandard]: Just wanted to say how much I admire your scholarship and careful review of sources. That's rare here, and it deserves mention, in my view. Best, &nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">
[Ohiostandard]: Re talking with checkusers, that couldn't hurt, I suppose, unless it were interpreted as forum shopping. And I certainly honor your intent, i.e. that you care enough to consider it. My concern would be that - I don't like saying it - checkusers might be as reluctant to sanction \""one of their own\"" as admins at AN\/I typically are. I'd thought of an RFC\/U, actually, since those tend to attract more non-admins than are typically present on AN\/I. But I do feel pretty strongly that however it's to be addressed, the situation shouldn't just stay as it is. That's just too harsh an outcome by half for someone who was trying to do the conscientious and responsible thing. &nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">
[Ohiostandard]: My point is that <u>whether Ohana ultimately agrees to strike-through his comments or not<\/u>, any individual who considers them a personal attack could reasonably do so. But it would be better, of course, if that action were supported by community consensus, and that's what I want to see develop with the !vote I set up. But I bungled the handling of it by not initiating that right away, and people lost interest. So I guess I don't understand why you think this can't do any good? If even half-a-dozen users would explicitly !vote for a strike-through, there would be no reason in the world we couldn't go ahead with that and provide justification for that everywhere we do it, in <nowiki><small><\/nowiki> text, with a permalink to the now-current AN\/I thread. Do you disagree, or is there something else I'm missing here? &nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">
[Ohiostandard]: Very well said. There are similar terms, I think \""octoroon\"" is one, that categorize people by their \""percentage\"" of \""white\"" versus \""black\"" blood, whatever that means. Of course these are racist terms in modern usage. This is absolutely a non-negotiable issue. &nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">

[Ohiostandard]: If that seems hard to believe, I can provide diffs of a recent instance of the sort of thing I'm sure Betsy would be subjected to. I'd be glad to do so, as long as it's understood that I wouldn't be asking for administrative action here by presenting such an example. Neither am I doing so here, with anything I've posted above, of course. &nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">
[Ohiostandard]: Hi, Huon. You saw [http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20050924220218\/http:\/\/hnn.us\/articles\/1812.html this], right? You can read it by increasing the \""magnification\"" in your browser window, usually via CTRL+ of course. Iit lists our friend Prescott as a \""partner\"" in Brown Brothers, Harriman & Company. Of course I'm sure you've noticed, too, that the fax machine stamp says at the top of each page, along with the page numbers and date, says \""from PARMET\"", which evidently refers to [http:\/\/hnn.us\/node\/1811 Herbert Parmet], and lists a \""to\"" (destination) telephone number of (815) 352-6124. I wonder who Parmet was faxing the documents to? Fun sleuth work. I don't have the time to do it, but the whole process of piecing together the whole story from the bits and pieces available would be fun sleuth work. Cheers, &nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">
[Ohiostandard]: Do we not have at least ''one'' policy that says it's a bad thing to call your fellow editors harpies, or one admin that's willing to enforce it? Especially coming after her infamous barnstar and having interjected the hounds image into Betsy's comment to make it appear that Betsy had put it there... [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard%2FIncidents&action=historysubmit&diff=432000276&oldid=431999491 As her pal No More Mr Nice Guy wrote], she does seem to have some kind of wish for a dramatic, self-destructive exit. I haven't mentioned it in the AN\/I thread yet, but it does need to be disclosed there. Understand, btw, that I'm talking to you as another editor here, not as an admin. I am absolutely not asking you for any administrative action here. &nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">
[Ohiostandard]: I did have that impression, yes. No doubt your natural authority and savoir-faire misled me. Try to be more goofy, like most editors here, in the future. To give oneself such airs is hardly seemly. Perhaps you could remedy the impression by putting up a userpage photo like [[User:Thumperward|this]] user... No wait; ''he's'' an admin. I'm so confused. &nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">
[Ohiostandard]: Btw, I suppose you've noticed that OhanaUnited has been laying low while all this has gone on, after he started the process? When a simple apology that everyone who's looked at the issue says he owes could have ended it at any time? That's been contemptible behavior, in my opinion. He made his exit right after the first person asked if he'd strike through his comments, and has been in hiding ever since, even after a WMF Trustee asked him on his talk page to apologize. ( He saw that message, based on the timing of it's having been posted, and on his few edits subsequent to it. ) If it were up to me, I'd pull him from SPI, at the absolute least. The community needs to be able to have an especially high degree of confidence in the integrity and good judgment of people who work in that area, and he's given us every reason to withdraw that confidence. &nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">
[Ohiostandard]: Hi to EdJohnston and Gatoclass, each on your respective talk pages. In [[User_talk:Ohiostandard#Re:_AGK.27s_closure_of_Supreme_Deliciousness_enforcement_request | <u>this<\/u>]] thread, I quoted you both [[User_talk:Ohiostandard#You_are_of_course_welcome | <u>here<\/u>]], beginning with \""outdenting\"". You'll need to read the thread for the context, however. I infer from AGK's talk, and from his removal of my talkback, that he does not intend to accept my suggestion that he consult with you both to ask whether you favored closing with no action. &nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">
[Ohiostandard]: Thanks for your reply. I did take it up with Ed, [[User_talk:EdJohnston#Close_by_AGK_of_Enforcement_Request_concerning_SD | <u>here<\/u>]]. He has no objection to the process by which AGK closed the request, which is his prerogative, of course. Thanks for letting me know of your self-recusal. I do have e-mail enabled, though; would you try again, just as a test? &nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">
[Ohiostandard]: I've nevertheless watchlisted this page, so I shouldn't miss any reply, and I do normally prefer to keep discussions on the page where they began. Thanks, &nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">
[Ohiostandard]: Thanks very much for taking the time to review the rationale. Perhaps I'm mistaken, but I suspect that if anyone were to ask Betsy, she'd naturally prefer to see the comments actually struck through at the SPI request page, perhaps with a <nowiki><small><\/nowiki> and very brief explanation such as \""struck-through by community consensus at AN\/I\"". I do very much want the thread to archive, though, so I'll go ahead and ask her to weigh in here, if that's alright, by posting to her talk, and then perhaps we can be done with this.&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">
[Ohiostandard]: Btw, I can't now recall whether [[User:Sj]] aka Samuel Klein also explicitly supported strikethrough, since comments have been made on so many different pages now. But I will just mention, in case people missed it, that he's an admin as well as an elected WMF Trustee, and that he explicitly requested, on Ohana's talk, that he reconsider his comments and apologize. Other admins have also supported some form of redaction, I believe, although it would take some time sorting through the multiple threads to verify that. &nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">
[Ohiostandard]: Because they usually operate only for a few days of actual editing, they usually don't leave enough behavioral evidence behind to tie them to any other account. They appear to be sophisticated enough to defeat checkuser tools, and they cause editors who uphold the rights of the Palestinian people (they nearly always seem to edit from a stridently pro-Israeli orientation) to have to \""burn\"" a 1rr edit to restore balance to an article, with established pro-Israeli editors then free to do whatever they like with the article. We really need a comprehensive solution to this problem. It seriously compromises the integrity of our editorial process. &nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<font face=\""Cambria\"">

[Ohiostandard]: Hi, Tiamut! Would you [[User_talk:Sean.hoyland#Use_of_reflist_template_on_talk_pages|have a look here]], where I mentioned you? I just sorted a jumble that you inadvertently contributed to on a talk page, and I'd appreciate it. The short version is that when you copypaste text from an article onto a talk page, and that text includes material between ref tags, you need to place a \""local\"" reflist of the form <nowiki>{{reflist|local=true}}<\/nowiki> in order both to make the embedded refs actally appear and, perhaps more important, keep them from being listed in ''other'' sections on the page that have nothing to with them. If you don't want the refs to show up, then you need to remove them from the text copied to the talk page, so they don't \""magically\"" show up when someone else adds a reflist in a subsequent section.

The article needs development and additional cites, but if the editor who made those edits thinks it has no value, and is improper for Wikipedia, then he needs to take it to AfD rather than effecting a unilateral deletion with a redirect, in my opinion. Since it's a new article, and has been edited by only a few contributors so far, I've posted this identical message to each of their talk pages, including that of the editor who made these two edits.

[Yoenit]: Hey, this was not intended for you, but for the person who remade the page
[Yoenit]: Hey, I remembered your name from a recent [[wp:AN]] discussion about a school project on wikipedia which got out of hand. I recently stumbled upon [[Talk:ITEC30011]], where a teacher expresses his desire to use wikipedia for teaching (or at least for demonstration). Could you have a look at it? '''Yoenit''' (
[Yoenit]: All articles in a CCI are manually reviewed for copyright problems. Presumptive deletion is only used in cases where there is strong evidence of copying, but no source can be located. Deletion of an article for copyright problems is a last resort measure and not done unless absolutely necessary. Your accusation that articles were deleted without review is baseless as well as offensive to all editors who contribute to the thankless job of copyright cleanup.  '''Yoenit''' (
[Yoenit]: Hi, I reverted your edits to [[Template:Db-meta\/sandbox]]. The use of a section header is problematic because it does not display correctly in the transclusion. I am also afraid that newbies will take the \""...\"" as a queue to start typing there and end up putting the whole rationale in the title. Lastly, as the [[talk:foo\/hang on]] page does not exist before the speedy is contested and it should not be used for anything else there is no reason to start a new section. '''Yoenit''' (
[Yoenit]: Well, for me the transcluded header displays as though it has nowiki tags around it. Is the [[Template:Db-meta\/sandbox|sandbox version]] working fine for you now? I don't understand why all posts should have a section header, can you explain the idea behind this? Sorry about the rollback, I did it because the undo function did not work and I when I tried to remove it manually preview showed me I was breaking the the template. Thought it would be allright if I posted an explanation on your talkpage. '''Yoenit''' (
[Yoenit]: It is not placed on the talkpage, but on a separate talksubpage [[talk:foo\/hang on]]. To the best of my knowledge transclusion has no problems handling other templates, unclosed span tags, hide tags, other transclusions or whatever else you can trow at it. I just tried to break the template and actually discovered. how to get section headers to display correctly (use a double transclusion), but could not get it to malfunction. Perhaps you have better luck. Thanks for the stuff about the manual revert. '''Yoenit''' (
[Yoenit]: Hmm, you raise good arguments. If the material is posted directly on the talk page a header is indeed required. Thinking about it a bit. '''Yoenit''' (
[Yoenit]: Hi, I am curious why you decided to create [[Lead to]], especially as wiktionary does not even have an article on \""lead to\"". '''Yoenit''' (
[Yoenit]: As I understand it you do a lot of work people who received a [[medal of honor]]. I just stumbled upon [http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/deedsofvalorhow02beyerich] and [http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/deedsofvalorhow01beyerich], which seems like a goldmine of information (including public domain portraits!) for pre 1900 medal of honor recipents. '''Yoenit''' (
[Yoenit]: Yeah, I kinda have the same problem. I should really stop getting bogged down in discussions and focus on doing the things I enjoy on wikipedia. Easier said than done unfortunately. '''Yoenit''' (
[Yoenit]: Sorry for somehow missing that message on my talkpage and letting you think I did not want to reply. I was distracted by something else after our discussion last month and completely forgot about the issue, untill I stumbled upon the village pump discussion. Mea Culpa '''Yoenit''' (
[Yoenit]: {{od}} The reason I wanted to use a separate subpage is that template coding can check for the existence of such a page and show up as contested if it exists. If we let the contestion rationale be posted directly to the talkpage we have to figure out a new way to let the template detect this, or every page with a talkpage will show up as contested.

[Yoenit]: Censoring profanity in other peoples comments is considered extremely rude. You are allowed to do remove personal attacks, but never do something like [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28proposals%29\/Proposal_to_require_autoconfirmed_status_in_order_to_create_articles&diff=423301626&oldid=423299099] again.

From your reply it appears you were not aware of this, are perhaps running a profanity filter of some kind which could have automatically changed these words? '''Yoenit''' (
[Yoenit]: Per [http:\/\/lists.wikimedia.org\/pipermail\/foundation-l\/2011-May\/065500.html this]. While I think enabling the function was a good idea, turning it on by default for everyone and neglecting to properly inform the community deserves a trout slap. '''Yoenit''' (

If somebody removes your g12 speedy in good faith it is obviously not an \""unambigous case\"" and you should follow normal procedures for copyright violations. '''Yoenit''' (
[Yoenit]: Except it wasn't a holdon, it was a removal by an uninvolved editor. [[Wikipedia:Deletion_policy#Speedy_deletion|Normal course of action is then to take it AFD]], not to invoke your admin powers and speedy delete it anyway. @Whatamidoing, I suggest you take it [[wp:DRV]] or request userfication if you are serious about improving the article in question.

WFPM,False,"[WFPM]: I know that you can lean on a bicycle and cause the bicycle to turn without turning the handle bars. Is that explanable.
[WFPM]: Your animated model shows it steering to the left as it turns to the left, and I think that is correct. But I think you do first steer to the right before you steer to the left, so now I'm even more confused.
[WFPM]: But you can make statements which don't involve frames of reference, like that the earth is oblate, and infer from that that there is a force of repulsion of material in the outward direction from the axis and in the plane of axial rotation that is a factor in controlling the non-spherical shape of the material of the earth, which would otherwise be spherical due to the action of the gravitational force.
[WFPM]: So now we have to examine as to what constitutes the so called elastic force that counteracts the so called gravitational centrical attractive force on the earths constituent materials. And then we note that the materials are rotating around the center of gravitational attraction of the earth. And thus on an individual mass value basis we conceive as to the existence of a force of repulsion of the rotating individual mass, and determine its value to be proportional to its kinetic energy value, divided by its radius of circular motion value. and we name that the \""Centrifugal force\"" value. And since it's an operative force, why should we deny its existence.
[WFPM]: Besides that's what it said in my Sokolnikoff reference.[[User:WFPM|WFPM]] ([[User talk:WFPM|talk]]) 19:06, 19 February 2011 (UTC)However, when you get right down to fundamentals, Purists have a right to deny the legitimacy of both the instantaneous centrifugal and gravitational force values on the basis that they are not values in a constant direction but are momentary values in a transient direction. And that's where you get into arguments about the rules of Euclidian geometry activity.
[WFPM]: Problems involving the Earth are often ones where use of a rotating frame can make things easier.  In a frame rotating with the Earth, every point on the Earth is stationary.  To explain the bulge in the equator, we invoke an special force that is required to make Newton's laws apply in our rotating frame, this is the centrifugal force, which pulls the equator out. [[User:Martin Hogbin|Martin Hogbin]] ([[User talk:Martin Hogbin#top|talk]]) 10:53, 19 February 2011 (UTC)The only frame that I can think of where every point of the earth of the earth is stationary is that at the earth's center of gravity and in a rotating condition matching that of the earth. And from that frame we would never even notice that the earth was rotating.[[User:WFPM|WFPM]] ([[User talk:WFPM|talk]]) 19:49, 19 February 2011 (UTC)And if the frame were not rotating, we could notice the lateral motion of the earth's constituents and thus the amount of their angular motion. But we wouldn't be able to measure the axial distance and it would look like the image of our system of starlight illumination and we wouldn't know about the oblateness of the system.[[User:WFPM|WFPM]] ([[User talk:WFPM|talk]]) 20:44, 19 February 2011 (UTC) But if the oblateness exists and we can't avoid the issue, we must assume the existence of some force capable of shaping the 3 dimensional property spacial distribution of the earth's material constituents. And that seems to be due to the fact that in linear motion all the masses components partake equally in the contained Kinetic energy of the system, whereas in circular motion they don't and thus require a special set of rules that explains how the contained kinetic energy is distributed among the constituents of the rotating matter, and which involves the angular rotation and resulting angular momentum value properties of the individual masses of the matter.[[User:WFPM|WFPM]] ([[User talk:WFPM|talk]]) 21:15, 19 February 2011 (UTC) And since both linear and angular momentum values increase with linear velocity values, whereas the kinetic energy value increases as the linear velocity squared, it may be stated that the angular momentum of a rigid system of rotation increases in proportion to the square root of the increase in kinetic energy.[[User:WFPM|WFPM]] ([[User talk:WFPM|talk]]) 22:23, 19 February 2011 (UTC)And thus, under a condition of stable rotary motion, there is no way for a linear force to correct this unbalance in contained kinetic energy, but only a way to add or subtract an incremental amount of kinetic energy, which is internally equitably distributed among the rotating system constituent mass values.
[WFPM]: If you keep your eyes focused on the moving toe you can usually catch each instance when you change the rotation direction, I think? Does that tell you anything?
[WFPM]: If cosmic rays are not stable enough to have come from somewhere, then where did they originate?
[WFPM]: You're confusing me! Is the thing acting in the earth's atmosphere a gamma cosmic ray from some distant galaxy, or else a neutron? And of course I'd be in favor of a local neutron, but I didn't think there were locally available loose neutrons. And I've heard about fast protons, but don't know what they do, except provide energy of transition for some reaction. And I guess I've just not got my mind working today, but I just cant see a gamma ray from a distant galaxy, either as a particle or a streams of small particles. Do we get gamma radiation from the [[Whirlpool Galaxy]]?
[WFPM]: Okay. trying to make method out of madness, we've got incoming primary (Cosmic),(electrostatically charged?)   particles (including electrons) from everywhere entering the atmosphere and creating secondary smaller particles in the earth's atmosphere, and no rays. And all of that is distinct from the electromagnetic light energy we receive from the [[Whirlpool Galaxy]]. And neutrons?. I guess Asimov didn't get around to write about all this stuff. But I appreciate the information."
Negi(afk),False,"[Negi(afk)]: I can write up the motivating examples and definitions for magmas, semigroups, and monoids to make them all look more like stuff we have for groups.  I can't see why standardizing it could hurt.  I mean, before I changed anything, the definition of magama didn't explain anything and all of the examples of semigroups confused and muddled up the definition.  I mean, there is something to be said for standardization, would you agree?"

logologist,False,[logologist]: It was very thoughtful of you to add portraits to this article.  They enliven it considerably.  Thanks!
Mcferran,False,"[Mcferran]: The content of these pages has not been merged.  All that has been done are redirects.  The information which was formerly on the pages for [[Alexander Ferner]] and [[Stella Ferner]] (for example) has not been transferred to [[Princess Astrid of Norway]] (which hasn't been edited since November 6).  Nor was the information which was formerly on those pages already on Princess Astrid's page.  In fact there is no mention whatsoever of Stella Ferner on Princess Astrid's page.  This does not seem to be in conformity with the Afd decision.
[Mcferran]: Today I moved this page and intended to move the talk page as well.  But I had the talk page open for editing at the time, so I've managed to create a situation with two talk pages: [[Talk:Principality of Piombino]] and [[Talk:Principate of Piombino]].  Do you have the ability to correct this (i.e. by removing [[Talk:Principate of Piombino]]? Thanks in advance.
[Mcferran]: I see that you have been removing middle names\/initials from a number of Episcopalian bishops on the grounds that this is [[WP:COMMONNAME]].  Unfortuntely, you don't seem to be checking Google or Google Books.  If you did (Google Books is more reliable since Google shows so many Wikipedia related hits) then you would see that [[Frederick Joseph Kinsman]], [[Jeffrey N. Steenson]] and [[Calvin O. Schofield, Jr.]] are all better known with middle initial\/name. I think it likely that this is the case with a number of other names you have changed.
[Mcferran]: There's nothing wrong with moving an article if it's currently not the common name.  But you ''seem'' to be under the impression that there is something generally wrong with middle initials.  I assume that you wouldn't try to move [[John F. Kennedy]] or [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]. There are lots of other people who are not generally known as firstname lastname (and that is especially so with Americans).  If you do not have some particular expertise about these individuals then I'm not sure why you are moving their articles. It is incorrect to presume that a middle initial is wrong. Moving articles to names never (or rarely) used for these individuals is damaging to Wikipedia's reliability."

By the way, [[Cyprus]] is also part of the [[Middle East]], well according to the page anyway.

I'm not at all annoyed with you opposing him, you are more that entitled to do so, you had a legitimate reason for opposing him, which all users are able to do. The fact that you're a 'crat makes no difference - all users get to voice their opinion in RfB, I don't believe you had any conflict of interest in your oppose. At the point of the oppose however, that's where your bureaucratic duties should have stopped and you should have recussed yourself from making any comment on closing the discussion - however, this did not happen. [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Raul654&diff=prev&oldid=143883634 This] is what got to me - despite you opposing the candidate, you spoke as a bureaucrat to say that you strongly objected to promotion and suggested an extension - you were not speaking as a regular user, you were speaking as a 'crat - In my honest opinion you crossed the line of a bureaucrat as your advice was based on your own opinion of the candidate, not on a neutral view looking at the consensus. In a nutshell, you were absultutely fine to oppose, and your reasons for opposing were fine - but the fact that you still acted as a bureacrat when discussions on closing the nomination were happening was wrong. I trust you cecropia, I think you're the best person to judge consensus on the project - but I really believe you had a serious lapse of judgement here, and used your own personal opinion of the candidate when offering advice on closing.

[Ryan Postlethwaite]: My point is that he went to commons and ran a check user when it was not required. He should have been well aware (or should have at least asked Majorly first) that these accusations have already been proven false previously. Then to suggest in Majorly's RfA that he is a sockpuppet of Matthew, when he quite clearly isn't per the evidence I've given at BN suggests to me an explanation is required.
[Ryan Postlethwaite]: NHRH, I'm so sorry your RfA didn't succeed. I think you're a fantastic user, and I hope you're not upset by how things worked out. Keep up your excellent work, and keep your head up. If ever you need anything, then pop over to my talk page - don't hesitate to ask for anything, I mean it.
[Ryan Postlethwaite]: Where've you been man?? It's good to see you back!
[Ryan Postlethwaite]: I know [[User:Politics rule|Politics rule]] was responsible for one of the Boricuaeddie accounts, not sure if he's done any of the others though.
[Ryan Postlethwaite]: Evening Ryan, any chance you could pop over to [[User talk:Blue5864]]? He's just withdrawn the legal threat (well stated that it wasn't intended as a threat) so he needs unblocking. Cheers,
[Ryan Postlethwaite]: Actually, he's just been accused of sock puppetry - I need sleep so I'll have to leave it in your capable hands to review! :-)
[Ryan Postlethwaite]: Hi, I've closed out your RfA as it was unlikely to succeed. Take a look over the comments, there's some good ideas in there for you that you should consider taking into account (like setting edit summaries to be required in your preferences). Don't be disheartened, many people fail a first RfA and come back shining in their second, and there's no reason why you can't do the same. Take care, and best of luck in the future.
[Ryan Postlethwaite]: Hey! Just seen your post to [[Wikipedia talk:New admin school\/Protecting]] - I was wondering if you could write a section on salting pages given that we can now do it by just clicking protect? I'd suggest using [[Wikipedia:New admin school\/Protecting\/Salt]] as an example - it's probably best keeping to the same format as we have to protecting articles. Anyway, it'd be good if you could do it :-) - thanks.
[Ryan Postlethwaite]: Bril! I knew I could count on you ;-)
[Ryan Postlethwaite]: Hi Acalamari, just a thought but why don't you move it into template space? Then it would be more accessible for you and everyone else. How does {{tl|Rollbackgiven}} sound?
[Ryan Postlethwaite]: I'm disapointed with this unblock - the user was clearly involved in disruptive editing, and that was a major concern for Maxim when he blocked for a week. He had just come off a 72 hours block for edit warring, yet continued to edit war making a one week block a valid increase. I see no real rationale for the unblock, and you haven't taken into effect the other factors, let alone discussing it with Maxim.

That's not good, and not how we do things. This user has clearly engaged in problematic editing for some time and the block was serving a protective measure for the encyclopedia.

[Ryan Postlethwaite]: They are unfortunate, and if you had gone through your RfB with the sentiments you expressed today, and probably your overall outlook on set percentages for RfAs you would not have passed - you are supposed to determine consensus, not act like a bot.

[Ryan Postlethwaite]: A bug up my butt? WKnight - there's a thread about it on [[WP:AN]] if you're interested.
[Ryan Postlethwaite]: Wow Mongo, never expected this. You've had a hard time here, but your work dealing with fringe views is invaluable. I hope you can look beyond this one block and see that you are very much appreciated here, and still have a lot to give. You have the respect of many people here and I hope after some reflection, you decide to stay. Best wishes,
[Ryan Postlethwaite]: Hey DerHexer. I'm just stopping by to let you know I undid one of your open proxy blocks. It was affected Sambc and the whois shows it's actually a university owned IP. I'm fairly sure it's not an open proxy, but could you have another look?
[Ryan Postlethwaite]: Cheers DerHexer - just wanted to double check with you. Hope everythings cool down your end.
[Ryan Postlethwaite]: Given that you are involved in the dispute on the above page, [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=HP_%28disambiguation%29&diff=209676495&oldid=209477775 this] edit is clearly non controversial and you should not be editing a protected page like that. Please revert yourself ASAP and start a talk page discussion.
[Ryan Postlethwaite]: I've blocked you for 24 hours for edit warring on [[Criticism of Bill O'Reilly]]. Whilst not by the book a [[WP:3RR]] violation, you clearly were gaming it by reverting 5 times in 25 hours. The reverts you have been blocked for are; [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Criticism_of_Bill_O%27Reilly&diff=213096258&oldid=213095556], [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Criticism_of_Bill_O%27Reilly&diff=213094884&oldid=213094164], [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Criticism_of_Bill_O%27Reilly&diff=212884401&oldid=212884124], [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Criticism_of_Bill_O%27Reilly&diff=213092692&oldid=212962557], [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Criticism_of_Bill_O%27Reilly&diff=212881744&oldid=212878519]. Please refrain from edit warring when your block has expired.
[Ryan Postlethwaite]: It prevented further edit warring, but I'm still looking into the reverts of the other participants.
[Ryan Postlethwaite]: I've decided not to block or warn any of the other participants. You reverted more times than any of them and they both believed they were reverting a BLP violation - no real comment on whether or not is was, but it could possibly be a violation. Reverting BLP violations is specifically exempt from the 3RR rule. When you were reverted the first time on BLP grounds, you should have started the RfC before reinserting it - not after 5 reverts.
[Ryan Postlethwaite]: Of course not, if there was no weight to the BLP concerns, I'd have probably issued a couple of warnings out, but I think there could be weight to it - not saying there definitely is, but certainly enough to require some careful thought and discussion before adding the texts back in. Even partial reverts are still reverts. Whether or not you were making changes to the text you readded, you were still reverting other users. Finally, the 3RR noticeboard is an ideal place to report almost all blockable edit warring incidents, not just the strict 3RR rule.
[Ryan Postlethwaite]: Quite possibly he should have reported it as 3RR gaming, but I looked into the issue as a neutral party. Whilst it's helpful to have dated diffs, it still expected that the admin looks at the whole context of the dispute before making conclusions. This I did myself and decided the course of action to take should be to issue a block to you. I don't think this is constructive us two arguing over the block, because I don't think there's anything you could futher say that hasn't been said already. I therefore invite you to ask a neutral administrator to review the block by posting; <nowiki>{{unblock|reason you believe the block was wrong}} ~~~~<\/nowiki> and you will quickly get a response from that.
[Ryan Postlethwaite]: I think it could have a place in NAS. It wouldn't be somewhere that people would go to as soon as they pass, but they would certainly look at it should they ever need to add to the spam black list. I'd suggest creating a new section on the admin school. If people don't want it, they don't have to use it! :-)
[Ryan Postlethwaite]: Aye, I'm with Maxim here. There really is no need to request a resignation over one bad block. Every makes mistakes and we learn from them. If there was a pattern, I could understand, but there really isn't in Cryptic's case.
[Ryan Postlethwaite]: Hmmm good look - there's a hell of a lot to catch up on. It's been a bad weekend for the wiki :-(
[Ryan Postlethwaite]: It's good off-wiki evidence showing these two are the same people on-wiki. It's not a block for off-wiki activity. Even so, he's unblocked now anyway.

[Ryan Postlethwaite]: Well, he was initially blocked for a while for making a legal threat against another editor. Then he returned under a new account, but he got banned under that because he was creating a battleground in particular areas. Since then, he's used a number of accounts to sock. That said, the accounts he's used to sock with have generally been to make fantastic content contributions (there's been a little trolling, but not too much). I think it's unlikely that he'll be coming back - I don't think he particularly wants to edit here, certainly not with restrictions against him and it's unlikely that the community would be wiling to unblock him without any firm restrictions in place.

Maciek17,False,"[Maciek17]: Hello Chooserr, I've got a question about your article about [[Argyronissos]] to you; isn't that article any joke? I want to know because I wrote an article - or translation :) - about that on Polish wikipedia ([[:pl:Argyronissos]]). That article seems to be a joke, because I think that Argyronissos is a big island (240 km<sup>2<\/sup>) and it should be seen on a map, but it isn't seen, for example, on Google Maps or Google Earth. If it isn't joke, please write to me the sources, from which you wrote this article. Thanks in advance for your quick answer (please, respond me on my [[:pl:Dyskusja Wikipedysty:Maciek17|Polish user talk]]), and happy Wikipedia Day! Greetings from Poland,
[Maciek17]: So, it seems to be a joke on German wiki. The article [[de:Argyronissos]] was writed by IP number ([http:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Argyronissos&oldid=2260006 1]) - you know, IP's very often are making stupid articles - and it was two times qualified to delete this article ([http:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Argyronissos&direction=next&oldid=2260006 2]). Maybe it is a mistake; no 240 km<sup>2<\/sup>, just 2,4 km<sup>2<\/sup>... Don't you think?
[Maciek17]: No, it's not any joke - I talked with German user who wrote on this article that Argyronissos is 240 000m2 big, and he explained me that 240 000 m<sup>2<\/sup> isn't 240 km<sup>2<\/sup>, just 0,24, so it is very small island.

[Vic Vipr]: A point was recently raised on WP:CVG talk [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Computer_and_video_games#coverart_or_screenshot_for_infoboxes.3F] that there is a consensus to use cover art instead of titlescreens or other screenshots in the infobox. However, I'm personally a bit peeved in terms of arcade games where cover art for ports do not always accurately represent the arcade game, taking alterations into account such as visuals that have been scaled down or mechanics changed to accomodate the target platform etc. Could you take a moment to give your opinion on the matter? ~

Arikk,False,"[Arikk]: Hi.  I reverted your recent change to [[Rabbit]]. The section you deleted had a {{Citation needed}} tag, and it would have been preferable to find an appropriate source (which I've now done), rather than delete it.

[Puffin]: Hello, I just wanted to introduce myself and let you know I am glad to be reviewing the article [[Citygarden]] you nominated for [[WP:GA|GA]]-status according to the [[WP:WIAGA|criteria]]. Congratulations! The article now has [[WP:GA|GA]] status.
[Puffin]: |style=\""vertical-align: middle; padding: 3px;\"" | It's good how you don't just use fixed messages for deletion, you use your own which can sometimes be funny. '''
[Puffin]: I was thinking if I had the qualities an admin had and I was reading the guides to Rfa, I was thinking about it because I do a lot of vandalism reverts and wanted to be able to block the vandals. Also, delete pages which meet the criteria for speedy deletion. It said to ask an active admin if they think that my contributions reflect the points I made above so, do you think my edits are good?

[Puffin]: It's been ages since the suspension of the account creator, please un suspend. I think I had a plausible reason anyway, but I was younger at the time and had no idea of the essays I was able to write to enable me to prove the innocence. '''
[Puffin]: Excuse me? Is it really fair after such a long and agonizing time that once a user has accidentally clicked a button and tried their best to correct the issue before being brutally ejected from the project is not forgiven? I fully understand the reason why I was suspended and I have admitted to correct the issues. After all, the issue was clearly an accident and every signle human on the Earth makes mistakes. When my user page was reverted and the person who did it made a mistake, they didn't have their rollback rights revoked and so why must I have my account creation interface access revoked from making a mistake? I was aware at the time and even as I had told you, I was trying to fix the problem before being brutally rejected from the project. I am asking you to re-consider your verdict because I feel it was unfairly and hastily rejected for a variety of bias reasons. I also do not like your clearly implied attempt to call me a failure. I thought that Wikipedia had a policy against personal attacks. I would not define this as an underlying issue either, it was a simple mistake that may have been made and forgiveness is in the true heart of all humans. Thank you again.'''

[Xerocs]: Thanks Durin but I think my stay here at the wikipedia will be brief... it seems that it isn't what you know, but who you know... the people writing the articles also seem to know how to bend the rules in their favor. Prime example being that Operation Iraqi Freedom is in fact the name of a military operation and does not encompass the whole background of Iraq. I posted my article so that it would cover the OIF not the whole shebang from the dawn of civilization and it became a \""revert war\"" because the original contributor (I am assuming) did not want his redirect taken away, even though I left the link and a see also button allowing people the opportunity to gather more on the subject of Iraq if they needed more than just the operation. Either way it is a mute point and until people realize that they are not nor will they ever be the sole authority on any given subject the wikipedia will be destined to fail. Contributors must realize that just because they decided to redirect a subject to something that it is entirely not and their redirect is changed, that it is not a personal attack on them. Alas, I have neither the power or the ambition to further pursue the child like politics of this website... when something is done about the way things are being handled I may look into it, until then though it seems to be a failed attempt. The 4 maybe 5 days that I have been here have left a sour taste in my mouth. Sed quis custodiet ipsos custodes?

[Nuujinn]: Can you point me to the discussion in question? I am happy to take a look and give you my opinions, for what little that is worth. I did take a look at your contribution list, and one thing I would suggest is that you slow down a bit and relax a bit, we're not going to finish Wikipedia today. I would also suggest you consider creating an account--it is certainly not required, and many of our best editors are IPs, but it does help somewhat in dealing with difficult issues. <span style=\""text-shadow: 0.2em 0.2em 0.1em #DDDDDD\"">--

[Nuujinn]: I think I got it fixed, take a look. <span style=\""text-shadow: 0.2em 0.2em 0.1em #DDDDDD\"">--
[Nuujinn]: Arbitration is not needed, at least not yet. First, we try to talk out the content issues on the talk page, and depending on how that goes, we seek other venues for help. The most important thing for the time being is to [[WP:AGF|assume good faith]] on the part of all parties, and stick to what the sources tell us. I'll try to help on the talk page some, but this is outside my area. <span style=\""text-shadow: 0.2em 0.2em 0.1em #DDDDDD\"">--
[Nuujinn]: Well, let me take a look, we're not really in a hurry around here. I can get to it tonight, and then we'll see where we are at. Generally, you want to make sure you're given the talk page discussion plenty of time to work before moving on. And at this point there are likely multiple uninvolved editors watching the talk page to see what we all do as we work towards consensus. Since you are closely linked to sourcing, you'll want to take things slow and easy, so as to avoid the appearance of pushing a point of view. <span style=\""text-shadow: 0.2em 0.2em 0.1em #DDDDDD\"">--
[Nuujinn]: Yes, I understand your feelings, and although I'm not a martial arts fans, I spent a bit of time in Thailand and know a little bit about muay thai, one of my childhood friends has been practicing Ta Kwan Do for over 40 years, so I can appreciate the differences. Here's the thing--in our dojo, we are slow and methodical, and we stick to sources. So in this case, we'll talk on the discussion page and be conservative in our edits, and this will take longer that usual because some of the sources under discussion are not accessible to everyone because they are old, not online and some in a foreign language. I can do some research this weekend and see if I can turn up any newspaper or magazine articles through my library or google. If sources disagree, we will weigh them and give each appropriate weight. You are close to the subject, and you may not like the final form of the article because you are also, in a sense, a source. Now, if Urquidez is offended by any of the content, there are ways for him to object, and we can explore those if need be. We'll do our best, but it will take some time. If discussions on the talk page do not get rolling in the next few days, we'll ask for some additional eyes on the article. Also, there's some puffery in the article, and I'll go through and try to clean that up a bit, we really try to keep language toned down. For what it is worth, you act doing a fine job, and I appreciate your joining the community. <span style=\""text-shadow: 0.2em 0.2em 0.1em #DDDDDD\"">--

I cannot find a journal named Archipelago that treats this kind of topic. There's a book which google says contains the term, but there are only a few copies in libraries.

[Nuujinn]: Yes, I am aware that Ross acknowledged Alexander, but Alexander did claim that Ross \""betrayed him\"" by presenting the technique as his own. Whether or not that statement by Alexander is true is not for us to decide, rather, what we do is present accurately what reliable sources say about the subject. In this case, so long as both statements can be sourced, both should remain, and we are doing our job in terms of documenting what was said by whom. Does that make sense? <span style=\""text-shadow: 0.2em 0.2em 0.1em #DDDDDD\"">--

[Escape_Orbit]: That looks good.  I suppose I've learned something today :)  My only other concern would where it says that the Protestant observation of the day followed that which was originally Catholic.  Naturally, the Catholic Church is older and everything Protestant originated out of the Catholic.  But I think what it says implies that adoption of St Patrick's Day by Protestants is something aside from, or later than, that.  In which case, would it be better for the lead to summarise that it is a Christian religious holiday, with greater significance to the Catholic Church, and leave its origins to a later section? --<font color=\""purple\"">

[Escape_Orbit]: I don't doubt you find it interesting, but I don't think [[WP:JUSTDONTLIKEIT|\""I like it\""]] trumps [[WP:OR|\""no original research\""]].  And we are agreed this is original research, something that is a against core Wikipedia policy? Naturally there is an element of personal opinion that comes with defining trivia and fancruft, but original research is fairly easy to define. --<font color=\""purple\"">
[Escape_Orbit]: That's exactly how ''not'' to use Wikipedia.  It's not \""official\"" because it's on Wikipedia.  It's \""official\"" because it's sourced to a [[WP:RS|reliable source]], and this trivia isn't.   If you'd like to record Monk trivia that you've worked out, then the place to do it on a fansite.  Not Wikipedia. --<font color=\""purple\"">
[Escape_Orbit]: Yeah, that's what Wikipedia does, it's an [[encyclopedia]].  And if you want to check, you can go to \""a bunch of sites\"".  My point is that this is [[WP:OR|original research]]  That means it isn't anywhere ''but'' Wikipedia and the reader has no idea if it's correct or not and no way of checking.  They only have the word of an anonymous editor who could be wrong, mistaken, mislead or even malicious.  That's why [[WP:OR|Wikipedia doesn't do original research]] and isn't [[WP:FAN|a fansite]].  --<font color=\""purple\"">
[Escape_Orbit]: Oh there's no problem with most of it.  It's almost all believable, and probably even all accurate as well.  But that's not the problem with it.  Criteria for inclusion into Wikipedia isn't \""well, it sounds like it's probably true\"". [[WP:V|It's verifiability]]. So it would be great if you could find a source.  And please remember, fan sites and forums are generally not [[WP:RS|reliable sources]], as they're equally just some fan's take on things which has all the same problems. --<font color=\""purple\"">
[Escape_Orbit]: Ah, the dangers of page moves.. --<font color=\""purple\"">
[Escape_Orbit]: Whether there are numerous sources with a definition of \""natural born\"" or not isn't the issue.  You need a source that discusses them ''specifically'' in connection with Obama.

[Mike Babic]: Even though I am a full-blooded Serb, my views should not be applied to all Serbs. Firstly it is my opinion that Serbs and Croats are the same in terms of genetics. Aside from physical similarities, there were language barriers when it came to Serbs\/Croats mixing with other ethnicities. The barrier was not present when it came to mixing between Serbs\/Croats. Also, in World War II, a great number of Serbs was either converted to Catholicism or were stolen as babies and raised as Croats as was illustrated in documentary \u201cG-d and Croats\u201d (Bog I Hrvati). This documentary can be seen on YouTube. On the issue of history Serbs and Croats vary massively. For example, some Serbian philosophers claim that Serbs and Greeks have much more in common than Serbs and Croats. The logic being is that during the Ottoman expansion both Serbs and Greeks suffered while Croats didn\u2019t share this burden. My personal views on Croats can be summarized in a quote that a Serbian diplomat gave, in a speech in the USA at the beginning of the 20th century; he said \u201cCroats are the bravest people, not because they are not scared of anything, but because they are not ashamed of anything\u201d. This view is supported by their history. For example, even though they left the Krajina region during the Ottoman expansion they still insist on their ownership. Even though Serbs protected the Krajina region for 500 years without any control or governor from Croatia, they still use military force to occupy that region. Now I can go on forever citing the backstabbing of Serbs in World War I and II, the backstabbing of \u201cSerbs of Croatia\u201d or even the backstabbing of Germans yet I will stop here since I feel like im trying to take revenge, and, in all truth, I simply don\u2019t care enough to think about Croats at all.

Also, Krajina came under Croatian control 60 years before WW2 in 1880's. It wasn't governed by Croats since 15th century.

Dieter Simon,False,"[Dieter Simon]: Hi, Selket, Your images in the stapes, malleus and incus articles is really excellent. However, the item in the image referring to the labyrinth needs disambiguating as it links to the classical [[Labyrinth]] rather than the [[labyrinth (inner ear)]] where it should link. Good work however.
[Dieter Simon]: &nbsp;&nbsp;What we should be including is that one of my favourite old authors Mark Twain for Sam Clemens ought to be mentioned, \""Life on the Misissippi\"" and all. Anyway, let me know, if there is anything I can do.
[Dieter Simon]: See your point, have cleaned it up. On second thoughts, I think the way it is explained now is probably best as that is what is meant by \""Twain\"" in this para, as Mark Twain's name originated with the Mississippi boatmen's shout \""mark one\"", \""mark twain\"" - one, two fathoms deep, as far as I remember, when they dropped their plumb lines or whatever to fathom the deep, and it isn't reall relevant.
[Dieter Simon]: Hi, Breakfast 100, I have already been involved in the article \""Selsdon\"", if you look in \""history\"" I added new content on 12 June 2005, 14 Feb. 2006, and 11 Apr 2006, which constitutes most of the introductory para, and the \""History\"" para of Selsdon.
[Dieter Simon]: Hoha2, nevertheless, you are advertising for your own company, aren't you? Even if you are giving a service, it is still advertising for your own firm. I am sorry that is very much spam, from where I am sitting.
[Dieter Simon]: Even if there is no commercial interest involved, it is still promoting a website (and a cause). Perhaps registering as a WP user, and then writing a little para referring to forums which can help those who have hearing difficulties, might alter the perception of what you are trying to do, but don't hold your breath. It will be pounced on for the above reasons, depending on the perception of the editor at the time. There can be no certainty that an external link (or any other content, for that matter) will remain if there is the slightest doubt of \""spam\"", I am sorry, we are an encyclopaedia and not there to promote \""causes\"". However, I wish you luck in your endeavours.
[Dieter Simon]: I am not arguing, hoha, I am just advising you what happens in Wikipedia, nor am I involved to any great extent. You were wondering why and I gave the reason that in Wikipedia anyone can edit an article according to the guidelines. I gave you good advice to register and be an editor on the article and explain what the forums do, rather than just enter an external link which almost certainly would be rmoved. That's all I can do for you. I shall paste this in the two hearing-related articles.

[Dieter Simon]: See http:\/\/classics.mit.edu\/Plato\/republic.11.x.html. The best way is to look for the word \""thrice\"" under your Find function. I have now rewritten the part in question. Perhaps you can let me know what you think. Many thanks.

[Dieter Simon]: No, it does actually tie in with the text of pubs with amusing names - in this case that was and no longer is! We are always concerned with substantiating and sourcing facts in Wikipedia, sometimes more worriedly than need be, but in this case, where there is no longer any tangible proof of a pub existing with such a name, a photograph is the only source. And what I said about pub heritage is still valid, and if this sounds quaint, a pub called \""Nowhere Inn Particular\"" is indeed quaint, but exist it did.
[Dieter Simon]: In the above he seems to have been quite a rower as you will see. Anyway, I will get back to you with the other query.
[Dieter Simon]: If I may, however, give you better advice still, put your queries into this Wikipedia helpline: [[Wikipedia:Reference desk]] It may attract some helpful replies from some of our fellow-Wikipedians. Good luck.
[Dieter Simon]: The German Wikipedia under [[Nationalsozialistischer Reichsbund f\xfcr Leibes\xfcbungen]] gives you the various \""Sportsbereiche\"" of which Sudetenland was the one for the area you are looking for. The blue link I gave you above will show you the Deutsch version on the left side on which you can click.

[Dieter Simon]: Am moving this discussion to the [[Talk:Tortoiseshell cat]] page.
[Dieter Simon]: Hi Martinvl, I don't know about being careful asking for citations. Are you saying that all those editors adding references (in the \""Reference\"" section) whenever they add any text are wasting their time, then?  When in fact we are being exhorted to do exactly that? See [[Wikipedia:Verifiability]]. The sheer fact that it hasn't been done more often, and that at a flick we can obtain those facts from Google, is neither here nor there. An encyclopaedia creating text, should always cite its sources, not ask readers to go somewhere else to verify facts in order to believe what has been written. No, we should always source our statements, it is not a big deal, espececially if we know where to find these fact.
[Dieter Simon]: Have sent following answer to Martinvl's talk page.
[Dieter Simon]: To be honest, I don't know, you can try and enter it the way you think. Though I have done editing for a number of years I have never come across it. Perhaps you can put a section into the Talk:Expressway page to see what others say for present and future purposes. Let me have a look and see if there is an external source I can find. Will copy this to Martinvl's talk page.
[Dieter Simon]: Yes, the image has been replaced by someone else's picture. I am alright with the change, I think it is a better one than mine, so go ahead.
[Dieter Simon]: They are, however, two different airports?
[Dieter Simon]: Have sent reply to Kimberry352, to explain.
[Dieter Simon]: If, however, you can cite such sources as to the facts, please do so, and yes, it would complement the section on the Edith Cavell execution indeed well."

[ScottyBerg]: I've just proposed a speedy as \""pure vandalism.\"" I think that category applies. If not, then that's one of those \""fall through the cracks\"" situations that requires fixing in the CSD criteria.

[ScottyBerg]: Since you have no real bone to pick with Dave on policy, what then is the purpose of your coming here to scold him? It strikes me as disruptive.
[ScottyBerg]: At the time these were agreed, there was some doubt as to when they expired. You indicated at the time [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia_talk:General_sanctions\/Climate_change_probation\/Requests_for_enforcement\/Archive_5#Sign_up_for_the_CC_restriction] that we needed to revisit the issue when the PD was issued, and sure enough it has. I guess my question is, are the vol restrictions over?
[ScottyBerg]: Perhaps intentionally so. There seemed to be an intent to lower the volume of the controversy by doing the bare minimum.
[ScottyBerg]: Replacement of the CC enforcement page with Arbitration Enforcement, which presumably gets a wider readership, was a good idea. One general comment: in retrospect, the process is amazingly opaque. This may seem like a newbie sentiment and it is, but to somebody looking at this process fresh it is amazingly contrary to Wikipedia practices, almost like a star chamber. First people have to make proposals, not having any idea if they'll be entertained by the committee. Then the committee deliberates like a jury for weeks or months. The process needs to be opened up.
[ScottyBerg]: I've tended to bend over backwards and to say that arbcom needs time to do this, that they need to read the evidence to make a thoughtful decision. Now I see how wrong I was. This wasn't a thoughtful decision. It doesn't even pretend to be a thoughtful decision. It certainly doesn't ''read'' as if it had been carefully hammered out. I was definitely naive in my expectations.
[ScottyBerg]: There was a lot of truth to that parody, apart from it being very funny. With some modifications it might be usable as a comedy essay.
[ScottyBerg]: The only thing I don't like about it is the snide reference to articles on the NY Subway system. Some of us are into that.
[ScottyBerg]: Done.
[ScottyBerg]: I see that the discussion was moved somewhere, and I don't really object as it was sort of off-topic. I'm assuming from the general thrust of the discussion that the voluntary restriction is moot\/no longer applicable.
[ScottyBerg]: Another kudo for your perceptive statement.
[ScottyBerg]: OK, I was just trying to get to the bottom of this. I guess this is one of those situations in which there is no bottom that can be gotten. ;)
[ScottyBerg]: Given that the case is winding up, and TGL is mentioned in the case pages, is is absolutely necessary to ''ban'' him at this crucial time? The same goes for WMC, who is also mentioned in the case pages.
[ScottyBerg]: If this was a bit earlier in the process, I'd understand blocking two participants named in the decision. But the clock is ticking, and removal of these two from the pages deprives them of a chance to speak in their own defense at a time when the voting seems to be picking up steam. I could see an eight hour ban so they can cool off. But three days just seems like too much.
[ScottyBerg]: I was under the impression things were wrapping up, but I could easily be wrong about that.
[ScottyBerg]: I'm not sure what (or who) Jehochman and TS are referring to, but I do have a concern about the wording of the definition of 2.1, \""uninvolved administrators.\"" I think that it needs to be broadened to avoid problems in the future. See [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia_talk:Arbitration\/Requests\/Case\/Climate_change\/Proposed_decision#Wording_of_2.1_.27Involved_Administrators.27].
[ScottyBerg]: That last bit is totally uncalled-for.
[ScottyBerg]: I agree that this[http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Arbitration\/Requests\/Case\/Climate_change\/Proposed_decision&curid=27694070&diff=390335723&oldid=390335257] kind of battlefield behavior does not bode well for the future.
[ScottyBerg]: No, the example is pertinent. There is a battlefield conduct finding against Lar but no appropriate remedy.
[ScottyBerg]: TS, you and Jehochman raised the issue originally, and I believe you raised the issue of Lar's behavior as well. This is not a postmortem as the case has not closed. Behavior in the arbitration pages is specifically mentioned in the decision.
[ScottyBerg]: Lar has agreed to remove himself from acting as an administrator. He has not agreed to remove himself from the CC articles, nor has he been asked to do so. Thus his comments in the PD page and elsewhere are pertinent.
[ScottyBerg]: A discussion is now underway somewhere as to whether it's kosher to have a section such as the one below, discussing scholarly articles proposed by the Banned. It's so utterly bizarre, but to someone familiar with Wikipedia it would seem routine. Of course, to one of the most active (and unsanctioned) CC editors, my very act of posting on this page would be considered... I forget the words he used. Fraternizing with the unclean?
[ScottyBerg]: It's unquestionable that the process was far more opaque than it should have been, and took too long. I think that everyone involved except the arbs would agree with that. Email deliberations have their place, but there was far too little communication with the parties.
[ScottyBerg]: It's at http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia_talk:Arbitration_Committee\/Noticeboard#What_does_topic_banned_mean.3F
[ScottyBerg]: Some valid concerns are being raised in that discussion, but valid only in the Wikipedia sense. Outside of Wikipedia, I'd think that trying to prevent scientists from listing sources would be viewed with amazement.
[ScottyBerg]: Based on the discussion that has arisen subsequent to the decision, concerning whether the topic ban covers user page posts, I sense a kind of huffy attitude and desire to separate WMC from these articles, even in areas not explicitly covered by the decision or even discussed during the case. There seems to be a desire to restore a semblance of harmony whatever the cost. Somebody said on this page a day or so ago that this is consistent with a website that is based on broad Internet participation. I'm not precisely quoting but that's the gist. The Internet does have a larger than normal proportion of people who advocate nontraditional POVs, and their needs must be served. That's the message I hear in this decision.
[ScottyBerg]: The user page comment thread was pretty unanimous that such posts are definitely not kosher, so I suspect that if they don't like what they see on this page they'll do more than unwatch.
[ScottyBerg]: Well, it appeared to me that the sentiment was against using the talk pages. Not unanimous, certainly. I was against it, for instance, for what it was worth, which wasn't much.
[ScottyBerg]: True, but the next block could keep him from editing his talk page as well. I agree that what's happening is going to shift a lot of activity off-wiki, and things can get hairy. I tried to raise that issue in one of the discussions a few days ago, but without success. I think that we're definitely seeing process triumphing over content here. The choice was made, and content is going to suffer.
[ScottyBerg]: ''you should . . . ignore blatant bad edits'': that's the definition of \""topic ban,\"" and the culmination of months of deliberations. Removal of the most qualified editor from the CC articles and an editorial in the Wall Street Journal praising arbcom for having done so.
[ScottyBerg]: I assume that this is being done in jest (it is, isn't it?), but it definitely can be misconstrued.
[ScottyBerg]: That 'secret mailing list' thing is a joke. The problem with jokes like that is that they don't translate well online, and are easily misconstrued.
[ScottyBerg]: AW's comments seem sensible, if \""Wiki self-preservation\"" is your aim, as may not be. The degree of hostility that I'm seeing directed at you is remarkable.
[ScottyBerg]: He seems miffed at a couple of things unrelated to arbcom.
[ScottyBerg]: You're the one whose behavior needs to change, not Slatersteven. You've been warned by at least four editors that you need to stop lording over other editors with sneering and incivil comments, especially comments that denigrate other editors for being \""new,\"" when you are editing against both consensus and policy. Slatersteven's use of the fringe noticeobard was entirely appropriate.
[ScottyBerg]: He was just warned by an administrator. If he disregards, that's no concern of mine. And by the way, it's not \""stalking\"" to watch the edits of a problematic editor.
[ScottyBerg]: Time will tell. It's hard to gauge his editing history because he edits out warnings from his talk page. That's permitted (actually, not permitted for administrator warnings), but makes it hard to ascertain past problematic behavior.
[ScottyBerg]: It seems as if most of this page was unintentionally hatted. Not sure how to fix this. What do you think?
[ScottyBerg]: Well, it's just that there are eleven items in the Table of Contents and only three are visible. I'm not sure how that happened, as it is not evident from the page history. Wasn't sure who to ask about this, so I took the liberty of contacting you.
[ScottyBerg]: Yeah, it looked like an incorrect archiving, but I wasn't sure.
[ScottyBerg]: Just a friendly word that I think that you're exchange with Lar is bordering on \""beating a dead horse.\"" However, one point you've raised in passing is very important and frankly is something I didn't know, which is that there is a panel of Ombudsmen out there to enforce the privacy policy, appointed by the Foundation and thus not accountable to the community. That's why you've been treated in such a high-handed fashion.
[ScottyBerg]: I think that you have a valid concern here on both questions. What's striking to me is the high-handed attitude and the lack of accountability. Sine this is taking place at the WMF level, however, I'm not certain what avenue of redress that you may have, if you feel that the Ombudsmen commission is not treating you fairly. There doesn't appear to be any.
[ScottyBerg]: On Jimbo's talk page he received a definitive statement of closure from another member of the AC. Remarkable how much of a ruckus he had to create to get that.
[ScottyBerg]: All changes were discussed and agreed to on the talk page, and were urgently needed to restore neutrality and remove the most egregious COI edits. It was revealed in a sockpuppet investigation that this article was principally authored by the sockpuppet of an indefinitely blocked editor with an obvious connection, per user name, with the subject of the article. See [[WP:Sockpuppet investigations\/Nelsondenis248]]. The article was a mess, with multiple issues including peacock terminology and unsubstantiated text. (P.S. the claim by this IP that I'm a \""teammate\"" of this editor is laughable. My only previous contacts with him were in the climate change articles, and I believe we were on opposite sides of that as I recall.)
[ScottyBerg]: If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding {{tlc|hang on}} to '''the top of [[:Berit M\xf8rdre-Lammedal|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion, or \""db\"", tag; if no such tag exists, then the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate and adding a hang-on tag is unnecessary), coupled with adding a note on '''[[Talk:Berit M\xf8rdre-Lammedal|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

[ScottyBerg]: I've been meaning to ask that myself. Do tell.
[ScottyBerg]: I'd appreciate it if you would email me. I'd email you but your email is not activated.
[ScottyBerg]: Editing of an article is expressly permitted during an AfD, and I can't think offhand of an article that more desperately needs editing than that one.
[ScottyBerg]: Those obviously can be dealt with on the talk page. The article is still problematic and in my view needs to be stubbified, if it is to survive. I've actually retained quite a bit that needs to go. Since editing this article, and especially cutting it, makes this a better article and thus less likely to be deleted, I don't see how you can possibly object.
[ScottyBerg]: Why not find a compromise name? Neither that is being fought about is very good. I have no opinion myself.
[ScottyBerg]: Actually I had a brain storm and came up with \""1928 cell phone user.\""
[ScottyBerg]: Thanks very much for the barnstar. It's my first, and greatly appreciated. I haven't edited that article in a while, which makes it an even more gracious gesture.
[ScottyBerg]: You recently engaged in this edit[http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=William_Walter_Kouts&diff=429985058&oldid=421154249]] in [[William Walter Kouts]], which is substantially about your father and illustrated by a photograph of him. This edit removed a well-warranted notability tag. I believe that your editing of this subject constitutes a [[WP:COI|conflict of interest]]. Will you agree to refrain from editing this article, and any other articles in which your father is mentioned, and their talk pages, in the future? Will you consent to not post on them in project pages and just generally exercise caution to avoid a COI?
[ScottyBerg]: If it was an article about one of these two editors, certainly talk page use would be appropriate. People who are the subject of a biography have the right and perhaps even obligation to object if their biography is inaccurate or unfair. But that does not apply in the Kouts article or to the merger target. We specifically don't want someone mentioned in an article, or a family member thereof, !voting in a merger discussion. I've also added a request that Antonio not post in project pages about articles in which he has a COI. The aim is that decisions about articles be made by editors not having a COI, and not influenced by conflicted editors.

[ScottyBerg]: You are under no obligation to participate in an RfC if you don't want to. What NW asked is if you'd waive the certification requirement (assuming you have the power to do so). You haven't responded to that. Will you?
[ScottyBerg]: Thanks, but had his responses in the ANI been even slightly satisfactory, we wouldn't be having this discussion. Viriditas - no, the tombstone issue was not resolved.
[ScottyBerg]: FYI, the ANI thread in which you participated concerning [[User:Marine 69-71]] has reopened.
[ScottyBerg]: FYI, the ANI thread in which you participated concerning [[User:Marine 69-71]] has reopened.
[ScottyBerg]: I think he made a useful suggestion. I see no harm in reposting his message. If reposting his message means that it makes Marine more like to remain administrator if the founder of Wikipedia believes he shouldn't be one, then I'll live with that bizarre consequence.
[ScottyBerg]: I appreciate your offer to not use your tools for a year, but I think that you should seriously consider giving up your tools, preferably for good but certainly at least for the year you propose. You have no need of them, and frankly you have demonstrated you should not have them. I apologize for my bluntness, but that is my opinion. I think that article writing and administration are two not necessarily complimentary disciplines. It is the same in RL. In RL I have tried managing, and I am not good at it. Administrating at Wikipedia is a burden that does not interest me. If I had it, and I was found wanting, I would want to be rid of it. I strongly recommend that you rid yourself of this unnecessary burden. Thanks for your note, and I do appreciate your conciliatory tone. Respectfully,
[ScottyBerg]: Anyway, so ends my soapboxing. If I've abused my hospitality please feel free to delete.
[ScottyBerg]: Thanks for your good wishes. It really hasn't been unpleasant, just something of a time sponge. I am heartened by Marine's better tone but my personal view is that he needs to give up his tools. Unfortunately, as you know, Wikipedia gives administrators life terms, which in my view is as bad for them as it is for everyone else. I agree with your post on that point in Jimbo's page. Hopefully this situation will be an object lesson, a kind of straw that broke the camel's back, demonstrating the necessity to make administrators accountable. There are just too many problems with administrators, and insufficient mechanisms for removal.
[ScottyBerg]: So yes, the article is excellent. It is probably among the top 1% of articles on Wikipedia. I would implore you to focus on what you do best, which is carrying out that mission. Leave the bureaucracy to the bureaucrats and managers. Please.

UKER,False,"[UKER]: I got this message from you about the Revenge of the Fallen article. I never claimed ownership of the article. I didn't even start it. If it was about me reverting your changes, then you should know your edits WILL be scrutinized. From time to time you may get changes reverted. Note that reverts are also scrutinized by other users. It's the way Wikipedia works. If you don't like that, maybe it is you the one that should consider not making the changes in the first place. The reason for my edit was specified in the edit summary and no other user saw any problem with it.
[UKER]: Well, I took a look again at your edit, which can be seen [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Transformers%3A_Revenge_of_the_Fallen&diff=291006761&oldid=291002485 here] and yes, you removed that 'weasel' sentence, which I could agree with, but that was among a bunch of other edits which were not justified, neither in the summary, nor the discussion page. Guidelines suggest that if you're making a lot of changes, each one for different reasons, you make them in separate edits. Had they been separate edits I sure wouldn't have reverted them all.

[UKER]: I really can't tell first hand, but my point is that while the game is presented as tying in to Chrome, Google themselves mentioning the existence of \""Chrome-exclusive content\"" implies their acknowledgement of the game's ability to run on other browsers. --
[UKER]: Ah-ha. I see your point. I always read the \""Chrome exclusive\"" thing as \""not in other browsers\"". Shall we write it to be as ambiguous as the source then? --
[UKER]: Glad you liked that. Thanks for noticing! --

[Aleenf1]: OK, they state \""all 53 CAF members have entered\"", but did not list down the teams, this mean anything could be change about the team, and we have team withdraw at the last minute in history, so do not judging anything basically from the text, and remember about [[WP:NOR]], the list yet published. --
[Aleenf1]: That is about navigation box, it is deflect from this topic, the main point is neither FIFA nor CAF publish that list, unlike AFC, they have completely announced the list. FIFA published 48 teams will competing early but because no list release, is unacceptable if the list there. That is where the resources come one. So, policy remain policy, that mean if no resources to prove it, it still consider crystal ball. And i'm not effectively saying what, and doing what i'm like or what i'm dislike, i'm work according to Wikipedia policy. The conclusion is, i'm no need to explain much more to you, that is all about policy. If i'm doing wrong, why most of football Wikipedian didn't voice to me about the problem? And NOR is about the public release, not Wikipedia release, i can say your point is hardly apply also because using WP as resources. --

If you're interested in participating I was hoping that you might be able to add your experiences from [[Thomas Jefferson]]. I'm asking you because you seem to have been one of the most involved editors there. I've read through some of the controversy which appears to have taken up three archived talk pages at present. Since I was not involved in that discussion I feel that you have the most perspective related to that. I have a draft page of the RfC in my [[User:Brad101\/GWALRFC|user space]]. Feel free to edit in that space or bring up questions on the talk page there. This RfC was triggered by Gwillickers behavior at [[Talk:Abraham Lincoln]] and I'm finding out now that this behavior has been going on for quite some time.
[Brad101]: Filed at [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment\/Gwillhickers]]. The two users who have unresolved issues with Gwill are Coemgenus and Parkwells. Those two editors must certify that they've tried to resolve an issue with Gwill and failed. Only those two editors (from what I can understand) must reply at the Rfc in the '''Users certifying the basis for this dispute''' section within 48 hours or the RfC will be invalid. Other editors like myself can post in the '''Other users who endorse this summary''' section.

Tammsalu,False,"[Tammsalu]: Hi Renata, I've noticed you have recently created a number of categories such as [[:Category:Anti-communism in Lithuania]], [[:Category:Anti-communism in Latvia]] and [[:Category:Anti-communism in Estonia]], and have added the [[:Category:Singing Revolution]] and articles like [[S\u0105j\u016bdis]] and [[Rahvarinne]]. I have some concerns about the implications of this. These events and organisations were about promoting the self-determination and independence of these countries, not \""anti-communist\"" per se. Note that many members of these independence movements were members or former members of the Communist parties in the respective countries. Also I've not seen any source that explicitly describes these events\/organisations as having \""anti-communism\"" as central plank on par with the aim of seeking independence and thus these categories give undue weight to this aspect which may or may not have played a minor role. IMHO labelling these movements\/events as \""anti-communist\"" somehow devalues them and their achievements. --
[Tammsalu]: You say these are categories, and not an exact science, but did these organisation have in their policy a platform of banning or outlawing communism, or where they primarily concerned with regaining independence? I know that the Soviet government opposed independence and these organisations opposed the position of the government of preserving the union. But just because these governments happened to be communist it is still a bit of a stretch to claim advocating independence was anti-communism, since according to Lenin the right to self determination was one of the fundamental rights of the working people. --
[Tammsalu]: At issue here is a long term pattern of trolling on Lia Looveer, implying she had Nazi sympathies when none of the sources actually state this, which in turn encouraged others to engage in similar behaviour[http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Talk:Lia_Looveer&diff=426524315&oldid=426415689], turning the article talk page into a [[WP:BATTLEGROUND]]. This fits remedy 8 of DIGWUREN[http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia:DIGWUREN#Editors_warned]: All editors are warned that attempts to use Wikipedia as a battleground\u2014in particular, by making generalized accusations (inferred by the talk page trolling) that persons (Lia Looveer) of a particular national or ethnic group (Estonian) harbor Nazi sympathies and such behaviour will be met with a summary ban. --
[Tammsalu]: The evidence of his sentiment was his statement: \""[http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Talk:Mass_killings_under_Communist_regimes&diff=371503074&oldid=371499794  The political implications in Eastern Europe have been to rehabilitate Nazi collaborators, villianize the Jews whom they connect with Communism and encourage discrimination against Russians living in their countries.]\"" I don't think I need to point out the odiousness of leveling this kind of sentiment towards Wikipedia editors who are representing mainstream sources in good faith. Evidently TFD's statement \""Seems funny to create an article about someone who is interesting because of her connection with colorful characters, <u>then remove all the references<\/u>\"" (which never happened) in [[Talk:Lia Looveer]] fits with his sentiment against ''\""rehabilitating Nazi collaborators\""''. The other manifestation of this sentiment, in this case of his opposition against ''\""encouraging discrimination against Russians living in their countries\""'' is TFD's recent accusation against myself (and subsequently a mainstream professor of Estonian ethnicity) of right wing extremist ethnic nationalist POV because I quoted the esteemed professor's book[http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration\/Requests\/Enforcement&oldid=413356387#The_Four_Deuces], [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User_talk:EdJohnston\/Archive_20#Occupation_of_the_Baltic_states]. TFD would have received a three month topic ban, when EdJohnston asked TFD to avoid implied slurs against others on contentious talk pages in the future and said: ''\""It is not clear to me whether TFD will refrain from harsh criticism of perceived opponents in the future, but the data which has been gathered could serve as background for future sanctions if the problem continues\""''. This history shows an evident pattern of tendentious battleground behaviour born out of a misguided view of the politics of his perceived opponents.  --

However, there are probably humanities & social science literatures about HP for which a section could be included in the article. There are some points in the article that touch on [[media studies]] or [[popular culture studies]] kind of approaches. It might make sense to look to include this article in lists and categories related to these fields. I don't know if there are wikiprojects for those areas. --
[Reswik]: You're welcome, Fbv. I just googled \""Harry Potter bibliography\"" and, in case you hadn't seen this, this resource came up:  [http:\/\/www.eulenfeder.de\/hpliteratur.html Harry Potter Bibliography].

[Avenue]: From [[Wikipedia:Copyright_FAQ#Can_I_add_something_to_Wikipedia_that_I_got_from_somewhere_else.3F]]: \""Works whose licenses restrict their use only to Wikipedia or prohibit commercial use are unacceptable on Wikipedia as well.\"" This is because Wikipedia aims to allow reuse, including commercial reuse.

[Avenue]: I see you're busy changing the \""Volcanoes of <period>\"" categories to volcanism ones. I have no objection to moving them, and I admire your industriousness, but I think the way you moved them (through [[WP:CUTPASTE|cut and paste moves]]) leaves us with a problem. It loses their edit history, which we need to retain to comply with the GFDL. I'll list them at the [[WP:REPAIR|cut and paste move repair holding pen]] for admin attention. In the meantime, I'd suggest not editing the new or old ones further (except perhaps to remove the {{tl|empty}} tag), so that the repair job is kept as simple as possible. --
[Avenue]: Yes, there's no \""Move\"" button for categories, but didn't you wonder why? The usual approach is to suggest the move at [[WP:CFD]]. I think this move is uncontroversial, so I am suggesting a simple repair rather than reversal\/listing at CFD. --
[Avenue]: I'm sorry you've felt overwhelmed by this. I don't think it needs to be a demanding process, although it may require some patience - discussions run for a week, and perhaps a few days backlog for attention. You can suggest several related moves in the same request. --
[Avenue]: On reflection, you're probably right that that's not the best place to ask for help. I think admins can rename categories, but the people at [[WP:REPAIR]] are less likely to be comfortable doing this. Somewhere at CFD is probably better. I'll ask about the best approach. --
[Avenue]: Routine recategorising after a CFD decision is usually handled by a bot, so I don't think you'll need to do all this manually. But you can if you really want to. --
[Avenue]: Well, it will take as least a week. That's assuming it gathers a consensus at CFD, of course. Thanks for holding off on further changes for now. --

However that service seems to have been replaced by one that doesn't let you choose an orthographic projection, so it's not quite that simple anymore. They did post their Perl script [http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20080511172137\/www.aquarius.ifm-geomar.de\/omc\/omc_bg_info.html#the_script here], if that helps you.

So the manual component is pretty trivial compared to the bot's. Seattle Skier set it up and has maintained it more than I have<s>, but it is now very out of date<\/s>. --

[Avenue]: I haven't done a thorough review or anything, but my impression is that our coverage of the North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans is reasonable, but most other areas range from fair to poor. Just looking at the region near where I live, for instance, there are about 90 known submarine volcanoes in the Kermadec arc,[http:\/\/www.sciencelearn.org.nz\/sciencelearn\/Media\/Images\/News-story-images\/The-Kermadec-Arc], of which we have articles for three, and [[List_of_volcanoes_in_New_Zealand#Kermadec_Arc_and_Havre_Trough|a list covering around a quarter]]. The [[Louisville seamount chain]] is comparable in length to the Hawaiian-Emperor chain, and we cover it in about four sentences. So I think there are a few gaps. --
[Avenue]: Still good grist for the [[WP:VOLC]] mill, anyway. --
[Avenue]: There still seems to be plenty of room in the article for images, and I think something like that cross-section would be very helpful. But if you're planning an expansion, then I agree it's worth waiting to see where it might fit best. --

[Avenue]: I think Maori being an official language is not quite the issue here regarding italics. Instead, for an English Wikipedia article, it's about how the words would appear in NZ English, in a formal written context. In that respect, I wouldn't expect to see the Maori name in italics throughout the text, but the four cases of italics in the current article seem okay to me. \""''Motutohor\u0101''\"" is the clearest case, since as far as I know this name isn't part of NZ English. The three italicised occurrences of \""''Moutohor\u0101''\"" are where we effectively say \""the term for this in the Maori language is ...\"", and in that context I think italics make sense. --

[Avenue]: I'm glad you like the new prose. Sorry if I've taken the fun of adding to it away from you; I've been trying to make the list more or less complete before it goes up on the main page. (I gather it's [[Template:Did you know\/Queue|due to go up]] tomorrow <s>afternoon<\/s> evening.) I don't think a separate table for the old form names would be ideal (it doesn't seem like something readers would expect), but I was wondering whether extra columns specifying the dividing characters (parentheses or slash) and the order (Maori or non-Maori first) might be worthwhile. Sounds like you have plenty of challenges on your hands with the land - I hope it all goes well. --
[Avenue]: Hi, I've already commented several times at the Nobel laureates one. I've also already looked at a couple of the others, which I didn't feel strongly enough about to comment on, so maybe I would feel the same about the rest. Anyway, I don't think it would be appropriate to look at the others now that you've brought them to my attention; I wouldn't want you subjected to accusations of canvassing. --
[Avenue]: Thanks for the notification. Sorry I missed the action. --
[Avenue]: Thanks; I've finally had a chance to comment. --
[Avenue]: Hi Aircorn, I've noticed your recent work on the NZ article, and I'm glad you're keen to improve it. I won't have much time to help in the immediate future (I think other things like [[Wikipedia:Featured article review\/The Catlins\/archive1|defending existing NZ FAs]] should come first), but I hope I can help out in due course. --
[Avenue]: The way I phrased that was a bit sloppy, sorry. I just meant that the Catlins FAR was a higher priority for me at present, not that you should feel any obligation to work on that first. (But of course any contributions you can make there would be welcome!) --
[Avenue]: Least I could do, when I realised I had got it wrong. It's probably time I took a break from the issue too. --
[Avenue]: You're welcome - I wish I could do more. Sure, go ahead and add those to the list if you like. One reason it's difficult is that FAC reviewers are often tough on the documentation as well as the intrinsic acceptability of images. For instance, I'm pretty sure [[:File:Treatyofwaitangi.jpg]] is in the public domain, and hence okay for Wikipedia to use, but its description page is a mess. --
[Avenue]: Thanks, I am glad it's over. The process was quite drawn out; there were a few times I thought we had addressed all the concerns raised, only to have a new reviewer turn up and raise several more. I was half expecting that to happen again, so it's a relief to be done. --
[Avenue]: Thanks, those are much better. I've uploaded a hi-res version, and worked on the description and sourcing. --
[Avenue]: Yes; I added that statement twice, once in the lead section, and once near the end of the article. I cited my source ([http:\/\/www.nzherald.co.nz\/nz\/news\/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10704493 this NZ Herald article]) at the second sentence (currently footnote #33), but not in the lead section. --
[Avenue]: I believe it's the heavily eroded remnant of a Miocene shield volcano.[http:\/\/www.environment.nsw.gov.au\/NationalParks\/parkGeoFormation.aspx?id=N0183] No way I would describe it as dormant though. About 22 million years old, with activity over 3 million years or so, and the hotspot track has moved on by over 1,000 km. I'm not an expert, but I would be very surprised if that volcano ever erupts again. It won't be in the Smithsonian database because that only goes back 10,000 years. --
[Avenue]: I haven't read through the whole article properly for a while. I'll try to do that in the next few days. --
[Avenue]: Hi, I have another image question for you. Was [[:File:KupeWheke.jpg|this photo]] taken from a place that is open to the public? If so, I think the photo won't infringe the carver's copyright due to [http:\/\/www.legislation.govt.nz\/act\/public\/1994\/0143\/latest\/DLM346215.html freedom of panorama]. I hope we can keep using the image; it makes a wonderful illustration. By the way, do you know who the carver might be? --
[Avenue]: Thanks, that's very helpful. I've incorporated it into the image description page. [http:\/\/waatea.blogspot.com\/2008\/11\/paki-harrison-biography-launched.html This link] suggests you are right about the carver. --
[Avenue]: I feel I have only played a small role in developing that article, but thank you anyway. And thanks for your contributions to the article too! --
[Avenue]: Well, there are several improvements I would ideally like to make, but the only thing I'm sure is definitely needed before submitting to FAC is a thorough copyedit. I will have a go at this over the next few days or so. --
[Avenue]: Well, the lead section needs work. [[MOS:LEAD]] says it should be no more than four paragraphs, but it already sprawls over five, and its coverage seems uneven (light on history and culture). I think it also needs to be made more inviting to the reader. So there's plenty to do there if you want. I'm probably about halfway through my copyedit, but I might take a break from that to look at the lead too. --
[Avenue]: Thanks, Maedin, that is much improved. Still a few dust spots, but good enough to get my full support. --
[Avenue]: Thanks also for offering to help with the [[New Zealand]] article. The main things I'm working on there now are copyediting and checking that we're following the [[WP:MOS|MOS]]. The article would probably also benefit from a general review from fresh eyes, and I'd be glad to hear any thoughts you have on it. But please don't feel obliged. --
[Avenue]: To be honest, I don't think I've ever heard of David Rankin before today. I was relying on the NBR's description of him as \""a relative of Mr Harawira\"" in thinking this came close to being a reliable source. I left the {{tl|citation needed}} tag in the article because the NBR seemed to distance themselves from the claim, by leaving it in Rankin's voice, and I thought more sources would be useful for a sensitive topic like this.  I've now looked around for more background on Rankin, and it does seem there is some friction between them (e.g. [http:\/\/tvnz.co.nz\/politics-news\/stop-acting-up-hone-maori-academic-3779678], [http:\/\/www.nzherald.co.nz\/waitangi-day\/news\/article.cfm?c_id=1500878&objectid=10421941]). I also wasn't aware of the [[Hapu Party]]. Taking all that into account, I think you're right that the NBR piece, while it might be a reliable source for what Rankin said about Harawira, doesn't seem like a reliable source for the truth of his claim. So I've <s>removed the citation<\/s> <u>reverted my addition, which I wasn't aware included the claim as well as the citation - see below<\/u>. --
[Avenue]: I've also just noticed that you removed the claim minutes before I added a citation for it. That explains why your post here seemed a bit heated. I wasn't aware of your edit when I made mine; I don't understand why I didn't get a edit conflict warning. I was only trying to provide a source as requested, not to reinsert a deleted claim. I'm sorry my edit saddened you. --
[Avenue]: I also think that the article is more neutral now that Harawira's Pakeha ancestry is also mentioned. Thanks for adding that. --
[Avenue]: I've now cited the NBR article, and reworded the preamble to Rankin's statement. --
[Avenue]: There seem to be at least three people involved here, so I think the article's talk page is probably a better forum than various user talk pages. (Yes, I have read yours.) I'll try and start a discussion of the issues at [[Talk:Hone Harawira]]. --
[Avenue]: Thanks for letting me know. I've reworded the remaining HIV+ example, which wasn't quite grammatically correct. --
[Avenue]: I've replied there. --"

[Rodw]: Thanks for the update on map progress, happy to look at drafts etc & comment but I'm no expert.
[Rodw]: I saw your comment on Kylet's talk page about not many nurses on WP you can always add your self to the category [[:Category:Nurse Wikipedians]] &mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for the latest draft - the area seem fine. Just one comment on colour - the blue\/gre for minor raods means that it is quite close to the rivers and streams & that could be confusing for those that don't know the area. I'm not surprised the lake doesn't show on 1890 maps as it was only created in the 1950s. I'm currently in Korea & get on a plane back to the UK in a few hours so may be able to come up with more comments in a few days (when I've recovered from jet lag), but as far as I can see at present it seems fine. Once the settlements are marked I think that will help to orientate people to the area. &mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for ther final draft - I like the one with the dotted line marking the basin - but would it be possible to make the text for the smaller villages a little bigger (It may be my eyesight but I find them hard to read). They are so much better than anything I could have achieved. It would be really nice to get these up before the [[Chew Valley]] Artilce appears on the front page (no date set yet) &mdash;
[Rodw]: Brilliant work - thank you - the village text font \""just smaller than than mid-level size\"" would be great. I did have one other thought it would be nice to label the high ground (SW of map) as the Mendips (if you did then we ought to add Dundry Down to the north, the Lulsgate Plateau to the west, and the Hinton Blewett, Marksbury and Newton Saint Loe plateau areas to the east, as well.) Otherwise I think that it's done & will be a really useful addition to the article.&mdash;
[Rodw]: I think \""Chew Valley\"" is OK as the title as that is what the article is called the other chew valley near Manchester is [[Chew Valley, Manchester]]. RE: Highpoints there are some [[Marilyn (hill)|Marilyns]], [[Beacon Batch]] ([[Black Down, Somerset]]) probably doesn't make it on but [[Dundry Down]] should. &mdash;
[Rodw]: Additional (from my son) wireless station grid ST499568 & another with trig point at ST546537 (284m) & possibly site for building the 335 foot (102m) turbine.[3] The planned 2MW turbine will be built at Shooters Bottom Farm (Grid reference ST595503). &mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for all your work on [[:Image:Chew Valley Map.png]]. I have now added it to [[Chew Valley]] and [[River Chew]] articles, although it's just been pionted out to me that you have put a label for \""Stoke Village\"" just south of Chew Stoke - however I believe this to be Stoke Villace & only consists of a fe houses.  I will have a think about any derivatives. I'm sure you know more about the valley than many people who live here & maybe one day you will get to visit! &mdash;
[Rodw]: Hi, as you spotted [[Chew Valley]] is to be on the front page next week. I'm going to be away on holiday & will have no web access so will not be able to counter any vandalism etc - would you be able to keep an eye on the page for me before & during 31st August? &mdash;
[Rodw]: Ages ago you helped me with a map for Chew Valley & wondered whether you might be able to help with another map. It's not actually Bristol, but not far away. I've been doing some work on the [[Kennet and Avon Canal]] & have put it up as a FA candidate. One of the comments made was that it would be improved by a map. I've seen maps [http:\/\/www.katrust.org\/museum_heritage_planning_001.htm here], [http:\/\/www.waterscape.com\/map\/ here] and [http:\/\/www.holidayuk.co.uk\/canals\/routes\/kennetavon\/map.htm here] but don't have the knowledge or skills to create one. &mdash;
[Rodw]: Another user has kindly volunteered to do this for me so please cancel the request. &mdash;
[Rodw]: sorry cancel last comment - thanks for volunteering that would be great & I will go & tell other user that its being done.&mdash;
[Rodw]: I see you've been tidying the categories on some of the SSSI articles I did from Berks to West Berks. Would you be kind enough to look at [[Locks on the Kennet and Avon Canal]] & check those for me as well. &mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks (I don't know the geograpjhy of Berkshire very well & these are based on the [[Kennet and Avon Canal]] & realted bits I've been doing) & thank you for spotting my typo - I've checked back in my books & you are right so I've changed to [[Hamstead Lock]].&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for the update. It was [[User:Yomangani]] at [[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates\/Kennet and Avon Canal\/archive1]] who suggested a map of the course would help to illustrate the article & it might be worth showing them drafts as well. &mdash;
[Rodw]: You also seem to have replaced the static maps with dynamic maps on hundreds of pages on my watchlist (around [[Chew Valley]] & the [[Mendip Hills]]). I would be interested to know how you identify the X & Y coordinates (so that I can do it on other pages) & what the advantage of the dynamic maps is? Does this relate to the fact that I put many of them on [http:\/\/www.placeopedia.com\/ Placeopedia] recently - if so why hasn't it included all the ones I did eg all of the [[Locks on the Kennet and Avon Canal]]?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Looking good - perhaps depending on space\/font etc the names of the surrounding hills. If there is space the [[Locks on the Kennet and Avon Canal|K&A locks]] would be great, but I doubt if you'd be able to fit them all in - perhaps just the major flights eg Bath, Seend, Caen Hill, & show the summit & [[Bruce Tunnel]] above [[Crofton Locks]]. Aqueducts (Dundas & Avoncliffe) & pumping stations (Claverton & Crofton) would be nice as well - but if you put all that on it's going to get v busy. Hungerford & Bradford on Avon should probably be shown as well.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks - you did suggest marking on the related rivers & canals - obviously key is the relationship with the Avon & Kennet rivers - is it possible to show where it is canalised river as opposed to \""new build\""? ie Bristol to Bath & Newbury to Reading. On a related note I've been working on the [[Somerset Coal Canal]] & will probably be told this needs a map to help explain the location of the arms etc... A K&A map with all the locks for the list page would be good if you don't think it would be to cluttered. Thanks again. &mdash;
[Rodw]: Hi,  You added [[:Image:River Kennet & canal in Newbury.jpg]] to [[Kennet and Avon Canal]] & I added it to [[Locks on the Kennet and Avon Canal]] and [[Greenham Lock]], but it doesn't display properly on my screen & seems to slow the downlaod of the article - any idea why? &mdash;
[Rodw]: Looking good - could we include the routes of the [[Somerset Coal Canal]] & [[Wilts and Berks Canal]] as they were important for the economy (or otherwise) of the canal. Nothing else I can think of apart from the key. &mdash;
[Rodw]: Final version looks good to me.&mdash;
[Rodw]: I think both the K&A canal map & the locks map are brilliant - will you link them from the article pages? Thanks again for all your work on this. Any chance of [[Somerset Coal Canal]] one? &mdash;
[Rodw]: By link I meant put them into the articles - I've done it now - but not sure if best layout. For the SCC probably towns & villages ie [[Paulton]] and [[Timsbury, Somerset|Timsbury]] via [[Camerton, Somerset|Camerton]], an [[aqueduct]] at [[Dunkerton, Somerset|Dunkerton]], [[Combe Hay]], [[Midford]] and [[Monkton Combe]] to [[Limpley Stoke]] where it joined the [[Kennet and Avon Canal]]. From Midford an arm also ran via [[Writhlington]]  to [[Radstock]], with a [[tunnel]] at [[Wellow, Somerset|Wellow]]. + [[Cam Brook, Somerset|Cam]] & [[Wellow Brook, Somerset|Wellow brooks]]. Hope that makes sense. &mdash;
[Rodw]: I've just revieved this on my talk page from [[User:Arpingstone]] can you help \""Rod, I very much like the map of the Kennet and Avon Canal that has been added to the article. However there are 2 oddities on it. First, the Somerset Coal Canal is shown as though it exists along its full length (I know you know it doesn't!). I assume the explanation is that light purple means old canals: if so the Legend doesn't tell me that. Secondly, the Avoncliff and Dundas Aqueducts are shown as though they are in the same place! Again I know you know that Avoncliff is just on the Bath side of Bradford on Avon.\"" &mdash;
[Rodw]: Another thought - we should really show the rest of the course of the [[River Avon, Bristol]] up to it's source near [[Chipping Sodbury]], as you've done with the Thames at the eastern end, & showing the close relationship between the river & canal to [[Bradford on Avon]] - otherwise it looks as if all the water in the Avon Navigation comes from the K&A.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for the updates - hopefully it will make the article clearer for everyone & once again thanks&mdash;
[Rodw]: Hi again, the following comment has been made by [[User:Moonraker88]] on [[User talk:Rodw|my talk page]]: \""This is a bit picky, sorry. On the high-resolution version [http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/a\/a2\/Kennet_and_avon_canal_-_map.png here] you've got the Avoncliff and Dundas aqueducts marked, but the canal stays on the south-wast side of the Avon. It's right on a river bend and would be hard to show, given the width assigned to the canal on the map to make it stand out. This is pointed out with deep apologies because, as you may remember, I can't draw at all!  ATB.\"" - This is actually correct but I didn't spot it previously & don't know whether you could possible do anything about it?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for fixing the bit of the Avon between the aqueducts on the K&A map - can you save a copy of the new high res one as the low res version? The SCC one clearly shows the relationship between the canals & the rivers. Can we colour the bit (southern arm) in a different colour & label it as originally course of canal & then of railway?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Hope you are happy with the changes I made? I would suggest leaving the village & locks articles as seperate.&mdash;
[Rodw]: SCC map looks good - I would suggest adding [[Paulton]] as there was a terminal wharf there, otherwise looking good. & thanks for the tip on making the K&A map show the latest version.&mdash;
[Rodw]: It looks fine to me & I can't think of anything else - but I'm sure someone will find a problem once it's up on the page :-(&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for adding these tags to [[Locks on the Kennet and Avon Canal]], I'm now trying to get my head around how this is of benefit & will be used. I've looked at [[Wikipedia_talk:Featured_lists#Proposed_change_to_all_featured_lists]] & think I understand what is going on & why there is a bit of text & an excerpt from the table, but I'm still unsure where this rolling\/random presentation would appear? Also, will you be doing this for [[List of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Somerset]] or do I need to learn how to add the tags?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Congrats on getting the dissertation submitted. if you are going to look at the photos needed for Bristol - can you keep an eye on  [[Grade I listed buildings in Bristol]], [[Grade II* listed buildings in Bristol]] & [[Grade II listed buildings in Bristol]] & associated articles. I've added pictures where I have them or can get then from geograph, but some are not very good or haven't got pictures at all. Any help appreciated.&mdash;

[Rodw]: Great thanks - I've just taken a look at [http:\/\/www.cotch.net Cotch.net] & I'm impressed you have thousands. I looked at the Bristol Harbour photos to see if you have any of the underfall yard - the one I took was removed recently as it wasn't good enough - but there are so many I couldn't find any, is it searchable at all?.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Hi, Can I pick your brains? would you consider Brown's Restaurant Bristol Byzantine?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks - can you take a look at [[Brown's Restaurant]] & revise as you think necessary?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Hi & Happy New Year, As I know you are a dab hand with maps, I wondered if I could ask for some help...The article on [[Exmoor]] is up for FA at [[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates\/Exmoor]]. I think I've dealt with all the reviewers comments apart from one requesting a map. (It's a US editor who I think is used to the system in the USA where maps creating by tax payers money are in the public domain. I've tried to explain issues with [[Ordnance Survey]] & pointed to [http:\/\/www.exmoor-nationalpark.gov.uk\/filex_02.pdf this one] which is on the further reading) If you could produce something I feel it will really help to get support for this FAC.&mdash;
[Rodw]: We also had a request as part of GA review of [[South West Coast Path]] to have a map of the route - which passes through [[Exmoor]] so if you were able to consider that one as well that would be great.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Unfortunately there has been a problem with [[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates|FAC]] (possibly due to transcluded pages\/templates & overall page size). As a result several nominations, including [[Somerset]], have had to be restarted and I have been informed that all previous commentary (both supporting and opposing), including yours is void. As a result would you be kind enough to review the page and place any comments at [[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates\/Somerset]]. Thanks&mdash;
[Rodw]: Soory previous message doesn't apply to your recent comments.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Hi, You've added several red links to [[List of places in Somerset]] which, as a far as I can find out, are tiny hamlets &, in one case, a single farm, which I don't think meet the notability criteria for their own articles. Therefore I've been doing redirects to the [[civil parish]] they are in - hope this is OK? if not please revert & start the relevant stubs (& I don't think they will ever be more than stubs).&mdash;
[Rodw]: Hi, You added an \""incomplete list\"" tag to [[List of civil parishes in Somerset]]. I believe this list to be complete unless you know of some others which I don't know about?&mdash;
[Rodw]: I've been using your excellent link checker tool on [[Geology of Somerset]], which is a current GA candidate & have dealt with most of the broken links etc. However the link to [http:\/\/www.environment-agency.gov.uk\/commondata\/acrobat\/severnpositionmay2006_1508223.pd Severn Estuary Barrage] from the Environment Agency gives a 200 error \""File extension (.pd) not in dictionary\"" although the link opens the PDF document fine. Any ideas or help?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Further to your GA review comments on [[Geology of Somerset]] a lot of work has been done on the areas you identified. I would be grateful if you would take another look and let us know if there are further areas of development you feel are required.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for your comments & suggestions for further improvement.&mdash;
[Rodw]: <small>(I've copied your reply here - I can't get on with split conversations, sorry!)<\/small><br\/> Hi, Thanks for your message. I'm no expert on this but have been trying to do them for the Somerset WikiProject & I think the overlap is because Exmoor sites come up under the Devon & Somerset categories. I've been following the instructions at: [[Wikipedia:Geocoding how-to for WikiProject members]] which only includes minute rather than seconds & the instruction to \""Please don't be [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Geographical coordinates#Precision|overly precise]].\"" - but I would agree for buildings etc seconds would be better. It's probably best to ask the question at [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Geographical coordinates]] where the real experts are.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Hi, Can I ask why you removed [[Somerset Rural Life Museum]] from the list at [[Tithe barn]] as the barn obviously performed the functions of a Tithe Barn for the Abbey?&mdash;
[Rodw]: I'm not sure not linking to the \""Tithe barn\"" article is reason to exclude it from the list (NB it does link now). The [http:\/\/www.imagesofengland.org.uk\/details\/default.aspx?id=265895 English Heritage citation] refers to it as a \""Abbey Tithe Barn\"" & I can't find the info on the difference you mention. The date of construction etc can not be more specific than 14th century. There is a photo of the exterior in the infobox - having visited the museum taking a better shot is difficult because of the surrounding trees - but I can go back & try again (in winter with less leaves) if you think that would be helpful. Basically what is the difference between an \""Abbey Barn\"" and a \""Tithe Barn\""?&mdash;
[Rodw]: I haven't got the motivation for abbey barn or to worry about it more - but you might find an article about the [[Tithe Barn, Pilton]] at some point.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Well done for creating the article - I'm just adding cats & refs. I have a picture to add but commons servers are being slow. How do you feel about an infobox for the article?&mdash;
[Rodw]: It might be best just to do [[Greenham, Somerset]] as a redirect to [[Stawley]] which is its parish & Stawley might be too small for its own article.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Hi, I noticed you had \""removed redundant map sources link\"" from various villages in Somerset. I'm not sure how you are doing this manually or via some software tool but the process changed the OS grid ref for [[Midford]] to place the village miles away from where it really is. I've changed it back but wanted to let you know in case this occurred elsewhere.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Hi, You keep popping up on my watchlist as providing great photos for some of the [[Somerset]] articles which don't have them. I was wondering if you had any more for articles at [[:Category:Wikipedia requested photographs in Somerset]] and could I ask a favour - to keep that cat up to date by removing <nowiki>{{reqphoto|in=Somerset}}<\/nowiki> from the talk pages of articles where you have added them.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for doing some of them. I've signed up but when I try to use the automatic upload (Geograph.org2Commons) I always get the error message \""TUSC verification failed\"".&mdash;
[Rodw]: Yep did that & seemed fine until I tried the automatic upload, but I'll do it again.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for all your great work adding images to the Somerset articles.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Hi, Thanks for your edit to [[Stoke-sub-Hamdon]] but could you give a full ref for (Collingwood: RIB no. 2229) if it is a reference. I'm guessing it might be Romans in Britain but many of our readers might have no idea.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks could you put it into the article ideally using the [[Template:Cite book]] & including ISBN etc if there is one. Thanks.&mdash;
[Rodw]: I have reverted your edit to the order of sections on the article about [[East Coker]] in line with the guidelines at [[WP:UKCITIES]] which, although not mandatory, are designed to achieve consistency across the thousands of articles about UK parishes, villages etc. I also note you marked the change as minor when I would not consider it to be minor, and would appreciate if you could give and edit summary briefly describing the change you've made. If you feel my reversion was inappropriate, perhaps we could discuss it on the [[Talk:East Coker|talk page]].&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for your comments. As the points you make seem to be general ones related to the guidelines at [[WP:UKCITIES]] and their appropriateness (or otherwise) perhaps you could suggest changes at the associated talk page, or the more widely monitored talk page at [[WP:UKGEO]]. Thanks&mdash;
[Rodw]: Hi, You added a referenced height for Glastonbury Tor on the [[Glastonbury]] article but this is different to the one on [[Glastonbury Tor]]. If you are confident of the source could you change the Tor article as well so that they are consistent?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Cancel that I was looking at \""prominence\"" by mistake, but it might still be worth adding the ref to the Tor article.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Hi, That sounds fine (& if you want a challenge there are a few (hundred) other Somerset articles which use imperial (metric)). Would it be best to use the convert template throughout? I would also add to your note on the [[Talk:Somerset|talk page]] explaining that you are planning to change all the measurements in the article to keep individual editors ( & potential FAR reviewers) informed. Thanks. &mdash;
[Rodw]: I can't spot any other problems at this point.&mdash;
[Rodw]: It wasn't the table I was thinking of (which I see you've converted) but the text in the weather paragraph.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Hi Aldux, Thanks for the heads up on this - I had removed some of these from my watch list as I've been focusing on listed buildings in Somerset recently & my watchlist is just too massive. I would support the argument for separate articles for the buildings, particularly the GII* which are definitely notable. I've added a note on the talk page and on [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Bristol]] asking for help. I will try to do my bit in expanding them when I get some time.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Hi, With your local knowledge could you look at [[City of Bath Technical School]] which I've been trying to help a new editor with. Also do you think a link to it should be put into [[Education in Bath, Somerset]]?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks seems sensible - the article was a bit of a mess when first crated but survived AfD & I did a major rewrite for MOS but all the content comes from [[User:Francis E Williams]] and any help would be appreciated.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Hi as someone who knows more about railways in south west England than anyone else I know, would you have any time to take a look at [[Transport in Somerset]] a new article by a new editor, which could do with some help?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for the comments - I've been working my way through [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Somerset\/Cleanup listing]] where it appears because of the refimprove tag. I'm not a cricket fan so have limited sources. If you have better ones to improve the article that would be great&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for your edit to [[Transport in Somerset]]. I was just adding bits from it to the town articles & noticed Taunton \""double deckers were sold to [[Leamington]]\"". I presume this is [[Leamington Spa]] but it links to a dab page so I thought I'd better check with the expert.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Hi, I put [[Buildings and architecture of Bath]] up for GA and a reviewer has started the review, making several comments (at [[Talk:Buildings and architecture of Bath\/GA1]]) about the structure of the article and areas for development. If any of you had any time to take a look and make any edits or comments you feel are appropriate that would be great.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for your comments, I've taken some of them into account (along with those of reviewer & others) in latest edits. If you have further thoughts they would be appreciated.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Could I ask you to take another look at your revert on [[The Blue School, Wells]], I believe you may have inadvertently put back the vandalism which had been previously removed.&mdash;
[Rodw]: On a similar note you changed dialled to dialed on [[Portishead, Somerset]], when I would have expected dialled for a UK topic.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Hi, I noticed several of your edits with the summary \""Fixed an improper bypassing of a redirect (see WP:R2D) \"" & thought I'd better check what it meant in case I'm making mistakes. How does changing the link on [[Wells (Tucker Street) railway station]] from [[Cheddar Valley Railway]] to the red link [[Cheddar Valley and Yatton Railway]] help the readers experience?&mdash;
[Rodw]: But [[Cheddar Valley line]] already exists about the line from Yatton to Cheddar so it is not the wrong article - therefore no new article will be created about it & if a new article was created I would suggest a merge. If a reader looks at [[Wells (Tucker Street) railway station]] or any of the other stations on the line they currently get a link to the rest of the line - following your change it appears that there is not article about the whole line. I do not think the change you made is beneficial. Would it be best to take it to the talk page?&mdash;
[Rodw]: I've created the redirect, but it might be worth checking if any of the other changes you are making has the same effect.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Hi, A few of us are working towards nominating [[River Parrett]] at FAC and I wondered if you would be kind enough to take a look at the new ecology section.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for your various additions & expansions to the articles I've been starting on priories, nunneries etc in Somerset. I've been working my way through the red links on [[List of monastic houses in Somerset]] (which also forms part of [[List of abbeys and priories in England]] ). If you had anything else on any of the others that would be great.&mdash;
[Rodw]: I've put Vivary Park for DYK - do you want a co-nom?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Tis done.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Could you help with formatting the species properly?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks again.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Hi I noticed you added [[:Category:Nature reserves in Somerset]]  to [[:Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Somerset]], however not all SSSIs are Nature reserves - several are geological & not noted for plants\/animals etc, so I have reverted this. The nature reserves cat may be appropriate for some of the SSSIs individually.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Looking at the lead of [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] I can understand your inference, but if you read further to the info on Geological SSSIs you will see the focus is on rock strata and fossils, with no requirement for there to be any link to anything living. Yes the protected status will protect the land from development (eg building, industry) to some extent, but there is no requirement\/responsibility relating to the ecology. That's my interpretation, but a lawyer may read something different into the [[Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981]].&mdash;
[Rodw]: Hi Peter, I've added a note saying \""All of the references use it as a title ie \""The Cross Bath\"", but I'd be happy for it to be moved to [[Cross Bath, Bath]] or even [[Cross Bath]] (because Bath,Bath is clumsy) and there don't seem to be any others - hopefully it would then comply with the MOS.\"" If you are happy shall I move it or will you?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Tis done.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Would you be kind enough to take a look at a new article [[Portbury Ashlands]] for me and correct any glaring errors I've made?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Hi, I've recently come across [[List of museums in Somerset]] & find that you have done similar lists for all counties. I've started adding photos & moving the external links into references etc - grateful for any comments. I've read the lead which says \""institutions (including nonprofit organizations, government entities, and private businesses) that collect and care for objects of cultural, artistic, scientific, or historical interest and make their collections or related exhibits available for public viewing. Also included are non-profit art galleries and university art galleries.\"" but I'm still a little unsure about the inclusion and exclusion criteria - some of those which are in I would count as historic sites but not necessarily museums as they don't have specific collections (examples might be [[Ashton Windmill]], [[Cleeve Abbey]] etc) and other sites which I would have expected to see included are not examples might include [[Ashton Court]], [[Brean Down Fort]], [[Taunton Castle]] etc. What about heritage railways etc or [[:Category:English Heritage sites in Somerset|EH sites]], [[:Category:National Trust properties in Somerset|NT sites]] etc I don't want to go changing one county too much if there are agreed criteria for all counties.&mdash;

[Rodw]: Also I've just taken a look at [[List of museums in Bristol]] (it would be great to add the relevant wikiproject banner to the lists talk page, where appropriate, so that local editors know of the existence of the list) and wondered if \""museum ships\"" eg [[Pyronaut]] & [[Matthew (ship)]] should included. It would also be useful to add something about these lists to  talk at [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Museums]].&mdash;

[Rodw]: And what about zoos eg [[Noah's Ark Zoo Farm]] or [[Bristol Zoo]]?&mdash;
[Rodw]: And what about zoos eg [[Noah's Ark Zoo Farm]] or [[Bristol Zoo]]?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for the response. I agree the definition of museum is difficult & was explored at [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Museums]]. As for specifics [[Ashton Court]] is included in [[List of museums in Bristol]] - althoug it is closer to Bristol than most of Somerset but officially falls within the county of Somerset. I hope to turn all the red links blue on the Somerset list over the next few weeks & add to the descriptions - which is what we are referencing, not using WikiPedia as a travel guide. These are based on previous experience and discussions of getting lists to Featured List status (eg  [[Grade I listed buildings in Bath and North East Somerset]] ([[Wikipedia:Featured list candidates\/Grade I listed buildings in Bath and North East Somerset\/archive1|FLC]]), [[Grade I listed buildings in Bristol]] ([[Wikipedia:Featured list candidates\/Grade I listed buildings in Bristol|FLC]]), [[Grade I listed buildings in Mendip]] ([[Wikipedia:Featured list candidates\/List of Grade I listed buildings in Mendip\/archive1|FLC]]), [[Grade I listed buildings in North Somerset]] ([[Wikipedia:Featured list candidates\/List of Grade I listed buildings in North Somerset|FLC]]), [[Grade I listed buildings in Sedgemoor]] ([[Wikipedia:Featured list candidates\/List of Grade I listed buildings in Sedgemoor\/archive1|FLC]]), [[Grade I listed buildings in South Somerset]] ([[Wikipedia:Featured list candidates\/List of Grade I listed buildings in South Somerset\/archive1|FLC]]), [[Grade I listed buildings in Taunton Deane]] ([[Wikipedia:Featured list candidates\/List of Grade I listed buildings in Taunton Deane\/archive1|FLC]]), [[Grade I listed buildings in West Somerset]] ([[Wikipedia:Featured list candidates\/List of Grade I listed buildings in West Somerset|FLC]]), [[List of civil parishes in Somerset]] ([[Wikipedia:Featured list candidates\/List of civil parishes in Somerset\/archive1|FLC]]), [[List of locks on the Kennet and Avon Canal]] ([[Wikipedia:Featured list candidates\/Locks on the Kennet and Avon Canal|FLC]]), [[List of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Somerset]] ([[Wikipedia:Featured list candidates\/List of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Somerset|FLC]]).  I also hope to add coordinates for each entry on the list which enables a kml file to map them all for users. Hope some of those ideas are useful\/OK with you. I think more general discussion on the wider lists of museums (rather than just Somerset) should probably be at [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Museums]].&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for your message re coordinates on [[List of museums in Somerset]], however I don't understand your comment about it affecting the sorting Town\/City column. I've tried it & it still works alphabetically.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Ahh I understand now. I hadn't looked at secondary level sorting within a town. We could move it to the summary field, either at the start or end of the text, but I think that may look out of place. I would suggest adding a new (non sortable) \""coordinates\"" column. The coords are seen as useful for mapping & almost a requirment if we want to get this sort of list to [[WP:FL|FL]] - which is where I see this heading eventually.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for your previous help with [[River Parrett]]. I thought I'd let you know it is now up at [[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates|FAC]].&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks - you helped with the harvnb ref format & now a reviewer is querying lots of the ref formats. I've dealt with some of them, however others such as \""First book listed is Blair, John (ed.) (2007) Author and chapter number missing (see Hollinrake and Rippon entries below)\"" & \""Formatting of on-line sources: Where the origin is a print sources, e.g. The Independent on Sunday, the source should be italicised, otherwise not. Check 3, 8, 9 and others\"" are challenging me & I would appreciate any help.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for your comments at this FAC. Would you like me to add back cite book, cite web etc or are you happy to do this?&mdash;
[Rodw]: That would be great - I'm hoping its the only outstanding issues. I've just realised I've just \""crept in\"" another book - Victoria County History.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Any thoughts appreciated.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for all your work on this.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks I've tweaked a couple of the articles, adding some stuff about museums to get rid of the red links.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Do you have a copy of Oakley, Mike (2006). Somerset Railway Stations. Bristol: Redcliffe Press. ISBN 1-904537-54-5? if so could you look up a page number for me? It is used as a reference on [[List_of_museums_in_Somerset]] (No 160) for the claim \""This structure now houses a recreation of the interior of the S&DJR signal-box at Midford. A second signal box is used as part of a signalling display in the yard and was formerly used on the S&DJR at Burnham-on-Sea.\"" - if you could help that would be great as this book is not available in my local library.&mdash;
[Rodw]: The same book is used on [[Chard, Somerset]] which I've nominated for GA to support the claim that the line to Chard closed in 1965, but without a page number. Also would you have a copy of MacDermot, E T (1931). History of the Great Western Railway, volume II 1863-1921. London: Great Western Railway which is used to support the claim \""Chard's railway was created in 1860 to connect the two London and South Western Railway and Bristol and Exeter Railway main lines 'cross-country' connection through Chard. The line's first traffic came in 1866 when the railway and major stations were completed\"" but also without a page number. If you have access to these books - could you look for page numbers for me?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks again for the excellent work. I don't suppose you'd fancy looking at the transport section of [[Nailsea]] which I'm working on as part of my [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Somerset#Somerset_towns_to_GA_-_help_please|crusade]] to get all settlements with over 5,000 population in [[Somerset]] to GA.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for the heads up - tis done.&mdash;
[Rodw]: I don't think you will get anywhere with changing the times (particularly at this late stage). You could try asking at [[Wikipedia talk:Did you know]] but I suspect the answer would be that this is a global encyclopaedia with a world wide readership & discriminating between countries\/time zones would be inappropriate.&mdash;
[Rodw]: I think some of the entries you've added for Bristol on [[Churches Conservation Trust]] are in Somerset.&mdash;
[Rodw]: I think it is the best source (see refs in the Somerset section) but their definition of \""Bristol Region\"" is very broad. If you [http:\/\/www.visitchurches.org.uk\/pf_search.php?p=1&lang=en&include=&exclude=&penalty=0&mode=all&q=Somerset&imageField.x=0&imageField.y=0 search the same site for Somerset] you get lots of the same entries. I believe the standard on wp is ceremonial counties & I think their Bristol Region may equate to [[Avon (county)]] which was abolished years ago. If you want any help with local geography let me know.&mdash;
[Rodw]: I just found one that I'd duplicated one of my own entries for Somerset - should these be alphabetical by church name or by place? Is this going to end up as one of your excellent sortable lists?&mdash;
[Rodw]: I believe Somerset is now complete - I haven't red linked those without articles - but if you want to do that I'd be very happy to help with the article creation (but it will not be for a few days).&mdash;
[Rodw]: Looks good - these massive lists can be a real challenge - doing all the grade I listed buildings in all 7 districts of Somerset took me about 9 months.&mdash;
[Rodw]: I would also keep the \""Friends\"" list separate, with appropriate titles & link via see also. You could do a list for each county with similar templates & perahps combine them into one article as has been done with [[List of abbeys and priories in England]] which was all one list originally & then split into counties.&mdash;
[Rodw]: I'm working on articles for the Somerset ones in the list but am unsure how to name the tower of the church of St James near [[Upton, Somerset]]. See [http:\/\/www.visitchurches.org.uk\/findachurch\/st-james-upton-tower\/?region=Somerset&offset=1 CCT entry] and [http:\/\/www.imagesofengland.org.uk\/Details\/Default.aspx?id=429589 IoE listing]. How would you name this article?&mdash;
[Rodw]: OK I will do it as [[Church of St James, Upton]] however there is a new church, also dedicated to St James, in the same village to replace it, which might conceivably get its own article one day.&mdash;
[Rodw]: All the CCT churches in Somerset now have stub articles (mostly with pics etc) except the [[Old Church of St Nicholas, Uphill]]. This has a [http:\/\/www.visitchurches.org.uk\/findachurch\/st-nicholas-uphill\/ CCT entry] (see also [http:\/\/www.uphillvillage.org.uk\/churches.htm last entry here]) but doesn't appear to be a listed building (possibly because it has no roof). What infobox would you use for this one as \""Infobox Historic Site\"" seems to be only for those included in suitable registers?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Any help you could offer with any of these would be great.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks again fro your help on these. I noticed your comment on [[Clevedon]] \""[[Clevedon branch line|branch line]] from the main railway at {{stnlnk|Yatton}}, opened in 1847, six years after the main line itself. This continued in operation for passengers until 1961,{{cite book|last=Maggs|first=Colin G.|title=Weston, Clevedon and Portishead Light Railway|publisher=Oakwood Press|year=1990|edition=2nd|page=21|isbn=978-0853613886}}\"" That \""This book is about the WC&PLR, not the GWR branch line.\"" do you have an alternative that could\/should be used - or any other way of improving it. Or should we just remove that ref & rely on the [http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/bristol\/content\/articles\/2005\/07\/04\/clevedonfortunes_feature.shtml BBC one].?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Hi, I noticed from my watchlist you had removed loads of external links to [http:\/\/digitaldigging.co.uk Digitaldigging]. Is there a particular problem with this site (has it been added to a blacklist or something) which would prevent it being used as a reference or is it just its inclusion as an external list which you are changing?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Hi, I wondered if you have any plans for [[User:EdJogg\/sandbox2|your draft about the Somerset Space Walk]] to go live at any point? I took the kids for a walk today along part of it & have added some more pics to [http:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/Category:Somerset_Space_Walk Commons Category:Somerset Space Walk] & would be happy to help.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Would you fancy applying your expert eye to the [[Wells Cathedral]] which has been languishing largely unloved for a while. I can help with local info but don't have your depth of knowledge on the churches & cathedrals of England or eye for detail.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for the ideas - I had sent her a message first as she & I debated the failings of the article on its talk page about 2 years ago! I'll wait for her response but may try to tackle some of it myself.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Did you spot the edits to [[Bridgwater and Taunton Canal]] where another editor has started to add a section about the space walk?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks - I've made a few minor tweaks as you will have seen. Can I assume you will be doing a DYK nomination?&mdash;
[Rodw]: I'm just helping to spread the word about the wikiproject, which was started earlier this week, by adding the project banner to relevant articles. I am not adding my name to the list of participants as my focus will still be Somerset - which was in a similar state to wilts before we started the project 3 years ago!&mdash;
[Rodw]: The \""northern\"" region looks fine on a quick scan. Let me know when you get to the southwest & I'll try to help with that one.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Are you planning to nominate at FLC? I'm working on SW England - but there are loads of entries most of which don't (yet) have articles. I would hope to have them all done in a month or two & would then do a SW list based on your formatting of the northern region.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Peter, as you may have spotted I'm slowly working my way through CCT churches in Wiltshire, but could I ask you to take a look at [[St John the Baptist Church, Inglesham]] as this one seems a bit special compared with the others I've done & I'd like to do it justice, before DYK nomination. I'm using online sources as its not in my books (which are generally about Somerset). Any help appreciated.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for your comment. I'm continuing to work on it, but I'm not familiar with the Church infobox, so could I ask you to apply it to the article as you are obviously expert in using it.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks I've used the churches infobox. Whenever I've looked at LBO it has the same data as IoE & the need to register\/login at Heritage Gateway\/LBO rather than going straight to the particular entry can be a barrier for some. What would you suggest as the DYK hoo? I was thinking about the 7 levels of paint in the wall paintings.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Any help appreciated.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Peter, Can I pick your brains again? I'm now doing CCT churches in Devon & working on [[St Martin's Church, Exeter]]. Both [http:\/\/www.imagesofengland.org.uk\/Details\/Default.aspx?id=88910 IoE] & [http:\/\/lbonline.english-heritage.org.uk\/BuildingDetailsForm.aspx?id=88910 LBO] give this as Grade B - have you got any sources saying this has been regraded to II* or II or whatever? If not should I use B in the article?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Would you be kind enough to take a look at [[User:Rodw\/Sandox\/List of churches preserved by the Churches Conservation Trust in South West England]] for any obvious errors before I put it up?&mdash;
[Rodw]: It's now up at [[List of churches preserved by the Churches Conservation Trust in South West England]]. Have you got any thoughts on the suggestion on the talk page about adding a separate column for county to enable sorting on that criteria?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Hi, Thanks for your edit to [[St Anthony's Church, St Anthony in Roseland]]. I noticed you added the WikiProject Anglicanism banner - should this go on all the churches listed at [[List of churches preserved by the Churches Conservation Trust in South West England]] which I put up yesterday - any other comments\/edits on that list would also be appreciated.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Hi did you spot my comment on the talk page of [[St Anthony's Church, St Anthony in Roseland]] about your page move? [[St Anthony in Roseland]] is no longer a parish.&mdash;
[Rodw]: I'll try to remember to add the comma between church & town later, but a certain copyeditor seems to be in full flow at present & I don't want to cause edit conflicts.&mdash;
[Rodw]: I'm not sure we can equate B with II*. I have seen a B go to grade I. I will email relevant individuals & organisations to ask if it has been regraded yet.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Just had an email back from English Heritage. Church of St Martin, Cathedral Close, Exeter is still a B. I've replied asking if we can equate this to II*.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for the note re CCT & consecration. I've amended the lead of the SW list & [[St. Paul's Church, Bristol]].&mdash;
[Rodw]: Following your prompt I've had another look at [[King's Sedgemoor Drain]]. Its definitely a B & I've changed it on the talk page, however when checking & formatting web references I found several deadlinks, which need to be fix or replaced etc.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Following your prompt I've had another look at [[King's Sedgemoor Drain]]. Its definitely a B & I've changed it on the talk page, however when checking & formatting web references I found several deadlinks, which need to be fix or replaced etc.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Its definitely a problem & they can be left with a deadlink tag which says this was available, but preferably an alternative can sometimes be found as you have done. If they are from a journal etc which a librarian could find they can be left without the URL as long as the full publication details are included. I've spent the last few weeks going through [http:\/\/toolserver.org\/~svick\/CleanupListing\/CleanupListing.php?project=Somerset WP Somerset cleanup listing] trying to replace deadlinks etc, but I don't have any magic solutions.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Hi Adrian, I've noticed that you've added loads of great pictures to Somerset articles & I've reused some of them on [[Portal:Somerset]] which I've been trying to improve - hope that's OK. If you have or know of others which would be suitable for the [[Portal:Somerset\/Selected picture]] section could you let me know or add them? Also I've been working my way through [[:Category:Wikipedia requested photographs in Somerset]] and wondered if you might have any suitable photos for those articles which are missing them?&mdash;
[Rodw]: As you may have heard [[Jimmy Wales]] is coming to give a talk at the [[Victoria Rooms (Bristol)|Victoria Rooms]] in Bristol on 13th January 2011 as part of wikipedia's 10th birthday celebrations. There is a possibility of a small group of local active wikipedians to meet him for 20 mins before the talk. If you are interested could you respond on the centralised discussion on the [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Bristol#Free Event: Jimmy Wales, Founder of Wikipedia, Talks in Bristol|Bristol wikiproject talk page]]?&mdash;
[Rodw]: There will be lots of cameras & the latest plan is for local active wikipedians to be involved in the meet & greets + press interviews 09.30-11.30 at the Watershed. The main talk (audience 650+ @ Victoria Rooms) is being recorded by the BBC & possibly streamed live on the web. Latest details on the Bristol wikiproject page above.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Hi Peter, Thanks - no problem with any of it being used for the other areas - if you want me to cast an eye over them in advance of FLC let me know.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Hope those quick comments make sense - if not let me know.&mdash;
[Rodw]: The row & column scope stuff has been discussed in various places try: [[MediaWiki talk:Common.css#Bold row headers]] & [[Wikipedia talk:Featured list candidates\/Archive 14#Accessibility and its changes to tables]]. It is part of [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (accessibility)]] Particularly the bit on [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (accessibility)#Tables|Tables]].&mdash;
[Rodw]: I'm not sure what I meant about the sorting now either & I can't find any Heritage Gateway references without a date, so I think all comments above dealt with. The sorting by placename works for me - I'm assuming Marefair is a suburb of Northampton, but that may be unclear & it stands out from the others. I can't spot anything else at present.&mdash;
[Rodw]: I've added [[List of churches preserved by the Churches Conservation Trust in the East of England]] to my watchlist but I have several (real) work deadlines to complete before Xmas so not doing much on wp for a few days.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Hi, With your mapping expertise I'd like to ask if an area map is possible. I've been doing some work on [[Somerset Levels]] and would like to put it up for FAC soon. At the [[Wikipedia:Peer review\/Somerset Levels\/archive1|peer review]] a map was requested. As it's not a county\/administrative district I didn't know whether it would be possible to do a shaded map or something showing the area covered, perhaps on a Somerset  or SW England map?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks. Your  [http:\/\/i51.tinypic.com\/eq5dva.png quick hack] is brilliant. I have no idea how you did it but think it really helps. Labels showing the major rivers (eg [[River Parrett]], [[River Axe (Bristol Channel)|Axe]] & [[River Brue|Brue]]), [[Bristol Channel]], hills ([[Polden Hills]], [[Mendip Hills]] & [[Quantock Hills]]) & major settlements (eg [[Bridgwater]], [[Burnham-on-Sea]], [[Cheddar]], [[Glastonbury]] & [[Wells]] ) would be great but it might get a bit cluttered. Someone else did [[:File:Mendip Hills Map.png]] for me when I put that one up for FA some time ago. I'm always really grateful when people are willing to contribute skills I don't have to make wp articles better.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Hi, I'm currently working to get [[Somerset Levels]] up to standard for nomination at FAC. It's had a peer review & currently undergoing a copy edit etc. This is throwing up lots of useful questions & specifically at [[Talk:Somerset Levels#Pre-FAC questions]] in a section titled \""Biodiversity and conservation\"" the comment: \""I understand that the capitalisation of common names for species is a bit of a hodge-podge right now, with no clear guidance, but it's surely hard to justify capitalising \""Common Crane\"" and not \""common snipe\"". Or capitalising neither.\"" I've tried to improve this - but I'm a bit confused as well. Would you be willing\/able to take a look at [[Somerset Levels#Biodiversity and conservation]] and offer any edits or advice?&mdash;
[Rodw]: It looks great. Are you happy for me to put it on the article where others will see it (& hopefully contribute to any discussion about development)? My only thought is about the brown lines - they look to me as if they are divisions between local authority districts? but this would not be clear to anyone who doesn't know the area & probably aren't that relevant for a geography article.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks, I've revised the paragraph - hopefully in line with your advice. It will be interesting to see if this is picked up if the article ever gets to FAC.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for your ongoing work on this - could we add markers for a few of the major settlements eg [[Glastonbury]], [[Bridgwater]], [[Cheddar]], [[Burnham-on-Sea]] - there are others but any more would probably overload the map.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for your edits to [[Peat Moors Centre]]. Do you have any references which support the claim that funding has been awarded, as both the references cited say this is proposed, but appear to be comment and may not meet wikipedia's requirements for [[WP:RS|reliable sources]].&mdash;
[Rodw]: Looks great to me - I'm just waiting for some more page numbers (books coming from the library) & then plan to put [[Somerset Levels]] up at FAC.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for tagging & assessing [[RNAS Charlton Horethorne (HMS Heron II)]] & [[RAF Weston-super-Mare]]. I've also been working on some of the other [[Somerset]] airfields over the weekend & it would be great if you could take a look at: [[RNAS Yeovilton (HMS Heron)]], [[Bristol (Whitchurch) Airport]], [[Yeovil\/Westland Airport]], [[RAF Weston Zoyland]], [[RAF Merryfield]] (which I think should be merged with [[RNAS Merryfield]]), [[RAF Culmhead]] and [[RAF Charmy Down]].&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for letting me know. Does it sound OK? I haven't seen it so will contact him & ask for a copy.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for your message. You obviously feel that you have been badly treated. You can remove yourself from the wikiproject (as can anyone - we are all volunteers), but I hope you will still feel able to provide wikipedia with the benefit of your local knowledge. Whether you are a member of the wikiproject or not if I can help please just let me know.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for the [http:\/\/www.newstatesman.com\/digital\/2011\/01\/jimmy-wales-wikipedia-site full text link].&mdash;
[Rodw]: While I'm here - you haven't got any pictures of [[Avon Valley Country Park]] and\/or the [[Strawberry Line (Miniature Railway)]] that you would be willing to share have you?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Hi Adrian, You haven't got any pictures of [[Avon Valley Country Park]] and\/or the [[Strawberry Line (Miniature Railway)]] that you would be willing to share have you?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Have you thought about putting [[Somerset Light Infantry]] up for GA? Obviously the [[WP:LEAD|Lead]] would need expanding to summarise the article but otherwise I think it must be getting close to GA standard.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for the insert I will comment on the FAC to see if that is what the reviewer wanted or whether it is a locator map. I can't find a suitable infobox as the Levels are not a protected area in the same way that [[Exmoor]] or the [[Mendip Hills]] are.&mdash;
[Rodw]: I don't know if you are watching the [[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates\/Somerset Levels\/archive1|FAC]] but another reviwer, while describing the map as useful, has suggested: \""but doesn't show many of the features and places mentioned in the article, nor does it show the area of the levels -one shade of green is clearly the lowest land but it is not stated what the maximum height is of this colour and therefore whether this coincides with the levels.\"" Could you add a key of the heights represented by the colours & I will ask for clarification of what \""other features\"" are needed without cluttering the map.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Hi, A couple of weeks ago when the copyvio problem was dealt with at [[Strawberry Line (Miniature Railway)]] you suggested the article was worth keeping. I am minded to put it up at AfD but thought I would get your thoughts first.&mdash;
[Rodw]: My concern is the lack of reliable sources, however [[User:Scillystuff]] has since added a bit of history with a reference - so maybe there are suitable citations which can be used. I spend too much of my time trying to deal with identified issues at [http:\/\/toolserver.org\/~svick\/CleanupListing\/CleanupListing.php?project=Somerset the Somerset cleanup listing] and this article has 2 banners (refimprove & wikify) which means it appears on that list.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks. Maybe I will go with the kids in the summer.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks. The profile [http:\/\/www.naturalareas.naturalengland.org.uk\/science\/natural\/profiles%5CnaProfile85.pdf PDF] is already in the article (used several times). On  [http:\/\/i52.tinypic.com\/2yyvb7s.jpg this map] the built up areas are useful - what is the yellow are? Did you also spot the request on the FAC to include the [[M5 motorway]]?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Would you be willing to add your comment about the significance of the M5 on the FAC?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Hi, Ages ago you added \""Twist, Colin, Rare Plants in Great Britain\u2014a site guide\"" as a reference to several articles eg [[Cheddar Wood]]. It is now used in the [[Cheddar]] article which has been nominated for GA & the reviewer at [[Talk:Cheddar\/GA1]] is asking is this a book, web site or what & looking for a better reference (including an ISBN if it is a book). Are you able to kindly provide any further information?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks. I can live without an ISBN but does it have a date of publication, publisher etc?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks again - I've replaced it with the SSSI citation (and reworded because of close paraphrasing) - hopefully will keep the reviewer happy.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Well done for your contribution in getting [[Cheddar]] to GA. BTW there is no need to update the recognised content on the project page, a bot will do it in the next day or two.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Hi, I don't know if you have [[West Somerset Mineral Railway]] on your watchlist? Another editor has added some tags eg Clarify (0-6-0ST \""Atlas\"" Sharp Stewart), By whom (LNWR 1873) & Prose (for the list of engines). I was wondering if you could look at & help out with any of these as you know more about such topics than I do (or ever could)?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for the heads up re [[:Category:Villages in Bath and North East Somerset]]. I didn't have that one on my watchlist. I've added my comment  - I think between us we could make it a viable cat pretty quickly.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for your help with [[:Category:Villages in Bath and North East Somerset]] (however it would be help to remove [[:Category:Bath and North East Somerset]] and [[:Category:Villages in Somerset]] as Villages in Bath and North East Somerset is a sub cat of both of those & we are not supposed to have an article in both parent & sub categories). As far as the other districts go I think we should definitely do [[:Category:Villages in North Somerset]] as both BANES & N. Somerset are Unitary Authorities. I am less sure about the others : Mendip, Sedgemoor, West Somerset, South Somerset & Taunton Deane as these are districts within the County Council area as opposed to UAs. I would suggest a discussion on these at the Somerset WikiProject before going too far.&mdash;
[Rodw]: I've done some of removing [[:Category:Villages in Somerset]] but there are still quite few more to do - it would be great if you could finish that. As for the navboxes you could use [[:File:Bath and North East Somerset UK locator map.svg]] & [[:File:North Somerset UK locator map.svg]] or a version of [[:File:Somerset Ceremonial Numbered2.gif]] resized as appropriate, however I'm not a map expert. [[User:Nilfanion]] has recently been very helpful with some maps for [[Somerset Levels]] and may be able to help.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Fine. Don't mean to intrude but why are you planning to retire?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Yes I would put Bath into the towns cat - there is no point in having a city cat with only one entry.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for the note re the Guardian piece in the Signpost. As well as commenting there I was recruited by colleagues in Wikimedia UK as one of the few UK academics with over 50,000 edits & was interviewed on BBC world service about why academics might want to edit wikipedia (or not).&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for the note re the Guardian piece in the Signpost. As well as commenting there I was recruited by colleagues in Wikimedia UK as one of the few UK academics with over 50,000 edits & was interviewed on BBC world service about why academics might want to edit wikipedia (or not).&mdash;
[Rodw]: Editcountitis is not that important... The interview ended up as about 3 mins & has been transcribed by [[User:MartinPoulter]] for WikiMedia UK who also roped me in to speaking at the [http:\/\/uk.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/Bristol_Wiki_Academy_1 first Bristol WikiMedia Academy]. I do have some problems with those who assume that their qualifications entitle them to avoid debate and others editing their contributions, but can also see their point of view. I believe \""knowledge transfer\"" is a role for academics in whatever field and wikipedia is one mechanism for this - although I edit wp in areas mostly unrelated top my teaching & research! The changing nature of peer review and metrics used for research assessment may (eventually) provide an incentive for contributions to wp.&mdash;

[Rodw]: It felt like summer today so I took the kids. So take a look at the pics on [http:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/Category:Strawberry_Line_%28Miniature_Railway%29 Commons]. I also have the contact email for the guy who set the railway up (he wasn't there today) if you want to make contact.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Hi, I noticed you had removed the climate paragraph on lots of Somerset articles. This was added because [[WP:UKCITIES]] recomends that a climate section should be included and it is very similar in areas which are geographically very close to each other. We should not expect readers (who may be from very different parts of the world to click on [[Somerset]] then [[South West England]] then [[Climate of south-west England]] to find out this information. Several of the articles have passed GA & FA assessments with this information included without any objection. I am thinking of reverting your changes and wondered if you had any rationale for their removal?&mdash;
[Rodw]: \""WikiProject Report\"" would like to focus on WikiProject Somerset for a ''Signpost'' article. This is an excellent opportunity to draw attention to your efforts and attract new members to the project. Would you be willing to participate in an interview? If so, '''[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost\/Newsroom\/WikiProject desk\/Interviews2|here are the questions for the interview]]'''. Just add your response below each question and feel free to skip any questions that you don't feel comfortable answering. Other editors will also have an opportunity to respond to the interview questions. If you know anyone else who would like to participate in the interview, please share this with them. Have a great day.&mdash;
[Rodw]: I will not claim to have any idea what a \""scale tamper\/liner\"" is, but you could suggest it at [http:\/\/www.strawberryminirail.co.uk\/index.html their site] (which gives an email but I also have the email for Mike Bass who set it up if you want). It wasn't very busy - my kids weren't interested in the train (which cost \xa31.50 per ride extra after the entry fee) - more into animals, boating lake & slides & I only saw the train go around the track a few times. The guys on duty were very welcoming & willing to talk as I think they had been sitting around most of the afternoon.&mdash;
[Rodw]: I just think the hook needs the word '''some''' added to explain it is not all species.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Hi, I noticed your edits to [[Leigh Woods]]. I agree with your removal of \""evocatively named\"" as being POV, but wondered why you removed the convert template for the area & the bold from Parardise Bottom which redirects to this article?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thank you for the excellent review of [[List of hill forts and ancient settlements in Somerset]]. I have acted on many of your comments and I will take the others to the articles talk page to get the comments of other editors.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Hi, Will you have a chance to respond to the latest comments on [[Talk:Nailsea\/GA1]] in the sport section or would you like me to tackle them as we may run out of time soon?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Hi I didn't know if you had spotted an issue raised about the wording of the hook at [[Template talk:Did you know#Open top buses in Weston-super-Mare]] which is stopping it appearing at present?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Its obviously been resolved in the last couple of days - the argument was about whether they were real criminals or not. See the [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Template_talk%3ADid_you_know&action=historysubmit&diff=429217319&oldid=429217249 diff] when it was moved to the queue.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for your help with it so far. There are still a few bits I want to add & sort before it is ready for FAC, including missing page numbers. Give me the weekend & then I hope most of it will be done. Any copyedit (or other edits) then would be great. I intend putting a note on the talk pages of interested projects & always ask someone like [[User:Malleus Fatuorum]] to look at the prose etc before nominating. Where I would still appreciate your input is the discussion on the talk page about where the section breaks should be (in both text and templates).&mdash;
[Rodw]: Further to this I am nervous about editing the route templates (due to lack of experience) - are you comfortable with editing them? If so could you move the last 7 items (including the A4 overpass which should be the A36) from the \""Bristol to Bath\"" template to the \""Bath to Devizes\"" template?&mdash;
[Rodw]: The sports section is certainly improved. I'd be happy for you to renominate it at GAC & I'll help out where I can with dealing with any issues.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Could I ask another favour. Several editors are working together to try to get [[Kennet and Avon Canal]] up to FA standard & I've got so close to it I can't see the wood for the trees. There are several birds & other bits of ecology mentioned, mostly in the \""canal today\"" section but also in the route sections. Could you take a look at the consistency of the naming of plants & animals (including latin etc)?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for all your work on this. As far as putting all ecology into one section this would give a problem. I specifically expanded each of the SSSIs & nature reserves it flows through so that there was enough text in each section to make it as long as the route diagram on the right. We've also been having conversations about making each section \""self contained\"" because of the way it is presented on mobile devices.&mdash;
[Rodw]: I've found references for most of your citation needed tags, however the sentence \""There are also many non-statutory nature reserves throughout the length of the canal\"" is giving me a problem as there are lots of references for each individual one, but I'm finding it difficult to find a specific source for this - the best I can find are documents for each county it passes through - any suggestions?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Well done for the extra work & congratulations - its just been passed.&mdash;
[Rodw]: You can put whatever you like on your user page :-) but each of the green circles on mine represents an article I've significantly helped to GA.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Any more thoughts on what else is needed, as I've done everything I can think of (apart from a couple more page numbers which I hope to get this week)?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for sorting out my mistake with the Coord template at [[Stogursey Castle]]. I'm intrigued how you found it. Is there a list or toolserver application which will identify them?  Basically I'm worried that I've made the same muck up ( missing out part of the \""landmark_region\"" parameter) on other articles - I write lots of geography and building articles which should be geocoded. I would go back and fix them but I'm not sure how to find them either in [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Special:Contributions\/Rodw my contributions] or in articles which would nearly all be in sub cats of [[:Category:Somerset]]. Help appreciated.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks - I don't think that is one I will check everyday though. I must learn more about some of what those type of tools can do.&mdash;
[Rodw]: I'll try to rewrite that tomorrow.&mdash;
[Rodw]: The pound is a stretch of water with no locks which also acts a reservoir to supply water to the rest of the canal - I'll look for other words - but that is what the sources call it.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Again I'll look for alternative wording tomorrow&mdash;
[Rodw]: I'll look it up&mdash;
[Rodw]: That's why I'm so grateful fro your eyes - I will reword (& add some punctuation).&mdash;
[Rodw]: It was originally going to be called the Western Canal, but the name was changed because the [[Grand Western Canal]] was proposed at about the same time.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Yes because that was what it was being called at the time.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks - I'll look at these over the next day or two but busy tonight.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Changed 2nd occurrence to navigable waterway with wikilink to canal.&mdash;
[Rodw]: [[Canal pound]] now wikilinked for explanation. It was linked later in the article but not on 1st occurrence.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Reworded.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Ideas first mooted in Elizabethan times - reworded.&mdash;
[Rodw]: I've turned this into 3 or 4 sentences - hopefully clearer.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Reworded - hopefully clearer. Not sure about the quote marks I think I was trying to illustrate that this was the name of the proposal but obviously didn't work - what would be a better way of doing this?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Hopefully clearer now because of item above.&mdash;
[Rodw]: As above.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Hopefully comments above addressed - please keep em coming.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Hi again. On my regular review of the [http:\/\/toolserver.org\/~svick\/CleanupListing\/CleanupListingByCat.php?project=Somerset cleanup listing for WP Somerset], I noticed that, about a month ago, you added citation needed tags for edits (by an IP) on [[Bishops Lydeard railway station]], [[Norton Fitzwarren railway station]] and [[Taunton railway station]]. The edits all seem to imply through trains on the [[West Somerset Railway]] to Taunton. Having done a bit of looking I'm unable to find any evidence, but wanted to check with you as you have more expertise than me in this area. If there are no plans or sources for this should we just revert back to the version before the IP edits?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Hi, I noticed your edit to [[List of monastic houses in Bristol]] in which you replaced full words with abbreviations (eg granted -> gnt). Is there any particular reason for this? My understanding is that it is best to avoid specialist abbreviations which might confuse general readers who stumble onto the page.&mdash;
[Rodw]: I'm aware of the transclusions (I remember helping to set that up, but whether they are still appropriate is another debate), however I would prefer all of the articles to have the English written in full and to get rid of the index of abbreviations on each of the county articles and the England list, to make them more readable for non specialists. I think each county article is likely to get editors and, more importantly, readers, who will not want to consult that table to work out what the different entries mean and are therefore likely to change them to the full words. If not the abbreviations may need to be added at [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (abbreviations)]].&mdash;
[Rodw]: I have expanded and explained the bit on acts of parliament, enquiries etc.&mdash;
[Rodw]: I don't quite understand this one. Because re-puddling took so long (& was very labour intensive, costly etc.) they tried to find quicker cheaper methods using polythene - what is the problem with the sentence?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Combined into one paragraph.&mdash;
[Rodw]: I will take another look at all units etc.&mdash;
[Rodw]: I've added a VIA two short tunnels - does this work?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Changed to [[Wader|wading birds]].&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks again for all your work on this article. It will probably be another week or two before I nominate it as I'm still waiting for one book for a page number & have put it up at [[Wikipedia:Peer review\/Kennet and Avon Canal\/archive1|Peer review]]. My target is to nominate after I have a few days away at [[Glastonbury Festival]].&mdash;
[Rodw]: I think the experimental bit was the use of polythene lining to make it quicker. The [http:\/\/www.avoncliff.co.uk\/history\/canal.htm source] says \""An experiment using heavy gauge polythene, covered by concrete was abandoned in 1967 but in 1976 work commenced at Avoncliff, using this method and the canal was lined as far as Limpley Stoke\"".&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for adding the refs etc on [[Chard Canal]]. It reminded me I wanted to ask if you would be kind enough to take a glance at [[Kennet and Avon Canal]] which some of us are trying to get up to FA standard. A current [[Wikipedia:Peer review\/Kennet and Avon Canal\/archive1|peer review]] is also in progress.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for all the comments & please feel free to put on the talk or PR pages. I have been thinking about the multiple use of references (with different page numbers) but I've never got my head around harvnb referencing templates. Your help with sorting out the maps (titles, icons, river Kennet or anything else) would be really appreciated. I don't quite understand the comment re images on the Newbury to Reading section.&mdash;
[Rodw]: I've moved on up a bit - does that help?&mdash;
[Rodw]: I've revised the book references as you suggested - perhaps you'd take a look? With [[User:EdJogg|EdJogg]] various revisions to the history section have been done, but if you wanted to have a go at the lead (or anything else) that would be great.&mdash;
[Rodw]: If you want to tackle the Harvnb &\/or the lead that's fine by me. I've been working on history following lots of (useful) comments at [[Wikipedia:Peer review\/Kennet and Avon Canal\/archive1]], so the lead might need to include some of that.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Sorry about the edit conflicts. I'm going to stop fiddling with it now. Still trying to find how much water Caen Hill takes per boat, but otherwise I hope I've addressed your current comments.&mdash;
[Rodw]: I saw what you were doing with the book refs - thanks. I'm never sure about the IoE template as I've not seen it used in a way which includes the publish (ie EH) & the title & accessdate - both of which are required before going near FAC - although looking at [[:Template:IoE]] it does seem to have extra parameters (which require extra work) for title & accessdate but not publisher. What is the advantage?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Possibly an advantages for the editor but no advantage for the reader? and one extra thing to be challenged on at FAC.&mdash;
[Rodw]: If I said that it would be [[WP:OWN]]. If you really think it would be beneficial why not suggest it on the talk page?&mdash;
[Rodw]: One further thought.. On [[Template:K+A-B-B]], [[Template:K+A-B-D]], [[Template:K+A-N-R]] etc all of the locks seem to be numbered logical & agree with the sources I've seen, but some of the bridges are numbered & some aren't. I also suspect some of the bridges are missing (they may have been demolished or renumbered). Do they have to be a significant (ie major road or rail bridge) to be included? what about some of the more minor (including swing bridges) & how is the criteria judged? Looking at the areas I'm most familiar with B-B & B-D even some A roads seem to be missing. Sorry if this is discussed elsewhere & I've missed it.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Great work thank you. I can see the argument for not including small tracks etc. Do you know if there is any logic to the bridge numbering? The specific example I had in mind was on B-D after Sydney Gardens Tunnel we are missing the bridge of the A36 which is quite a major road. In Bradford on Avon we are missing the A363, There is a railway crossing at Hilperton. Also on the B-B map we seem to be missing the A4 at Newbridge on the western edge of Bath and the A3604 and A367 in Bath itself. I am not that familiar with the symbols so some of these may be included but me failing to spot them. I am also less familiar with the canal beyond Devizes, but could try to do it from maps if that would be useful?&mdash;
[Rodw]: I have been brave and attempted to do the bridges on the B-B map & one on B-D - please check I haven't broken anything. Looking again at some other sources the A36 goes over the Sydney Gardens Tunnel & I have no idea whether a symbol exists for a road going over a tunnel.&mdash;
[Rodw]: |style=\""vertical-align: top; border-top: 1px solid gray;\"" | For your fantastic achievements with the Lists of churches preserved by the Churches Conservation Trust &mdash;
[Rodw]: Nor did I until someone gave it to me a few weeks ago. You probably qualify for the FA one as well.&mdash;
[Rodw]: You could look at [[Grade I listed buildings in Somerset]] & its 7 sub lists (all FL) as possible formats etc.&mdash;
[Rodw]: I think the medals (eg [[Wikipedia:Other awards#The Featured Article Medal|FA Medal]] are different to [[:Template:FA-Barnstar]] (which I haven't got & didn't know existed till now).&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for continued work on these. Although Pearson doesn't number the bridges on maps, the Collins\/Nicholson guide does - so do you want me to add numbers to bridges where they are included, or should I stay out of your way?&mdash;
[Rodw]: OK I'll add bridge names\/numbers as I get the chance. In the light of that change I have no objections to the IoE template, but still seems like extra work for limited benefit.&mdash;
[Rodw]: The IoE template seems to have added double full stops after [[English Heritage]].&mdash;
[Rodw]: IoE template seems to have been fixed. On B-B map Bridge 207, a railway bridge appears to be missing, but I don't know the correct code to add this one (I've been copying & adapting the others).&mdash;
[Rodw]: OK re bridges - point taken. Another thought... On [[Template:K+A-B-B]] we start with \""to [[Netham Lock]] and [[Bristol]]\"" (should this be from?) but why do we start with [[Hanham Lock]]? The text starts from Avonmouth & attempts to describe [[Bristol Harbour]]. I have looked at [[Template:New Cut, Bristol map]] & wondered if this should be included or joined in some way? I was also wondering whether B-B or the new cut maps should go on [[River Avon (Bristol)]] or the Bristol Harbour articles?&mdash;
[Rodw]: If you could that would be great as you are much more familiar with the symbols etc. NB I will be away for most of the next week (at [[Glastonbury festival]]) so will be unable to do anything else on the K&A for a while.&mdash;
[Rodw]: I've been working on the [http:\/\/toolserver.org\/~svick\/CleanupListing\/CleanupListingByCat.php?project=Somerset Somerset cleanup listing] again and came across [[Weston College]] which has both citation need tags and a cleanup banner. Would you have any time to kindly take a look?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for the (virtual) beer. How did the Bristol Wiki Academy go today? Sorry I couldn't be with you in person.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for all your work on [[Nunney Castle]] & congratulations on getting it to GA. Following your inspiration I've had a bit of a go at [[Dunster Castle]] and wondered if you would take a look at that? When I get some time I might try to tackle some of the others at [[:Category:Castles in Somerset]] if you fancied collaborating?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks. I've removed 116 & 119 & associated claims. Re edubase I can't see any way of combining Somerset LEA (or whatever its called this week) with N.Som & BANES.&mdash;
[Rodw]: My search on edubase (\""LA subset: English; LA name: Somerset; Phase of Education: Secondary; Type of Establishment group: Academies, Maintained schools; Open\/closed: Open, Open, but proposed to close\"") found 37 secondaries but our article says \""Somerset has 30 state and 17 independent secondary schools\"". Something ain't right but I'm not sure what?&mdash;
[Rodw]: We could change it, but that still leaves us without a viable reference to support it. How about [http:\/\/www.schoolswebdirectory.co.uk\/leasearch.php?lea=Somerset this]?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks both - the level of vandalism is less than when I've been involved in previous TFAs. Nothing else currently planned (too busy working on [[Kennet and Avon Canal]] at [[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates\/Kennet and Avon Canal\/archive2|FAC]]) - but I didn't request either of those, so who knows what will happen!&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for letting me know. I see it has been removed as \""too soon for another Somerset article\"", which I think is probably right. Something to think about at some time in the future.&mdash;
[Rodw]: I don't think there is a specific Somerset \""house style\"" for infoboxes on castle articles. Since Infobox historic building was removed as an option I tend to use [[:Template:Infobox historic site]] simply because it includes fields for the date and reference number for listed buildings and scheduled ancient monuments. I have debated this elsewhere but I don't think consensus was ever reached.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for your copy edits and comments on the [[Kennet and Avon Canal]] and at the [[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates\/Kennet and Avon Canal\/archive2|FAC]]. Malleus has now finished another copy edit sweep and it would be great if you could take another look.&mdash;
[Rodw]: At the [[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates\/Kennet and Avon Canal\/archive2|FAC]] a reviewer has highlighted the lack of information about Bristol Harbour (although it is included in the route map diag). As you [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Kennet_and_Avon_Canal&action=historysubmit&diff=437443769&oldid=437425693 took this out] could you join in the discussion?&mdash;
[Rodw]: I've had a bit of a go at [[Bridgwater Castle]] today. I know the lead still needs expanding, but would you fancy taking a look?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks - works for me. We will have to see what the reviewer says.&mdash;
[Rodw]: I've added the [[slighting]] link & listed status for the watergate etc. Can I leave the others to your expertise? What do you mean by \""latest work on the geopositioning of Norman castles in Somerset\"" ? book?&mdash;
[Rodw]: That would probably be useful as a companion to [[List of hill forts and ancient settlements in Somerset]]. I've done a bit of expansion on [[Cary Castle]] and now working on [[Castle Neroche]] which should be public later this evening (and could appear in both lists). Do you think some of these others could be joining [[Nunney Castle]] before long in going for GA?&mdash;
[Rodw]: If you both like I'll start a page in my sandbox for everyone to edit (once I've done with [[Castle Neroche]] this evening). We do have some of the non linked or possible ones - but some may not be the same era ie in the Iron Age list. This points up the need for clear inclusion & exclusion criteria to be included in the lead. As an aside from your favourite name try [[Fairy Toot]] at [[Nempnett Thrubwell]], but tis not a castle.&mdash;
[Rodw]: OK very early first stab to show the sort of thing I'm thinking about is at [[User:Rodw\/Sandbox\/List of Norman Castles in Somerset]]. Feel free to edit etc, but don't expect column sorting etc to work yet.&mdash;
[Rodw]: I would like to remove Extant as a title & the \""vanished\"" and \""possible\"" lists - they can always be added if\/When we get more evidence. Then I'd like to make it public for others to edit - what do you think?&mdash;

[Rodw]: Thanks for your further comments about the [[Kennet and Avon Canal]] at [[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates\/Kennet and Avon Canal\/archive2]]. I believe they have been addressed and it would be great if you had time to take another look.&mdash;
[Rodw]: If you feel it meets the FA criteria the normal practice is to add a support (in bold) - see what Jezhotwells has done higher up. But of course it has to be your decision & I wouldn't want this to be seen as canvassing.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for the ce. I'll look at the issues you are raising, but I think you deleted a support from Reaper Eternal with your last edit ? edit conflict.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for Wimble & Liddiard. Are you happy if I move it now to [[List of castles in Somerset]]?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Tis done - lets move further discussion to the article talk page rather than clogging up yours.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for the message. I'm not aware of any background paragraph for the articles linked from [[List of castles in Somerset]]. It might be worth looking at those listed at [[List of castles in England]] for other counties. I know [[Locking Castle]] needs doing, but I'm not sure about  [[Castle Orchard]] or [[Downend Castle]] which are the other redlinks. I would suggest starting this discussion on the talk page as others such as [[User:Hchc2009]], who specialises in castles, might have useful ideas.&mdash;
[Rodw]: I noticed a link to the LeisureDome article had been added to the WsM article, but should something also be put on [[RAF Locking]] &\/or [[Locking, Somerset]]?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Having done a bit more checking (eg [http:\/\/www.pastscape.org.uk\/hob.aspx?hob_id=202574 this]) [[Castle Orchard]] appears to be in Wilts. I'me still trying to identify [[Downend Castle]].&mdash;
[Rodw]: On [[Wimble Toot Castle]] you added a redlink to [[Downend Castle]] suggesting it was 19 miles along the River Cary. I'm trying to identify this but can't find it on Pastscape. Any hints or ideas for more info?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Could it be called Chisley Mount (see [http:\/\/www.castlefacts.info\/contentpages\/castledetails\/castledetails.asp?country=England&countyid=36&County=Somerset&castleid=3457&latitude=51.1662&longitude=-2.9884&uin= here]) or the one [http:\/\/webapp1.somerset.gov.uk\/her\/details.asp?prn=11447 here] and [http:\/\/www1.somerset.gov.uk\/archives\/hes\/downloads\/EUS_DownEndText.pdf here]?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Its miles from S. Glos. Down End doesn't have an article. It's just north of [[Dunball]] part of the parish of [[Puriton]]. Just not sure what to call it - various sources call it Downend Castle, Down End Earthworks ([http:\/\/www.pastscape.org\/hob.aspx?hob_id=192333 here]), Motte with two baileys immediately east of Bristol Road, Down End, Chisley Mount & Motte and Bailey castle, Down End. Down End definitely appears to be 2 words.&mdash;
[Rodw]: OK initial stub at [[Down End Castle]], with redirects done for alt titles. I'll add it to the list later.&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks all for useful comments. I tend to agree that many readers will have a concept of castles and 1066 and all that (but this may be UK bias), however I was less familiar with [[The Anarchy]] etc. I think the difficult bit is balancing explaining in the article the context for construction (or a siege etc) and just adding a link so that the reader can go and find out more if it is of interest. A good edit and clean up of the lead would be useful as I sort of threw it together and would be the first to say it is not very good yet. The only redlink I can see on [[List of castles in Somerset]] is [[Castle Orchard]] which is in Wilts not Somerset. What do people think would be suitable as an infobox or lead image? I have been watching maps appear on [[List of castles in England]] and wondered if, when the Somerset one is available, that could be used?&mdash;
[Rodw]: I've added a request at [[User talk:Mjb1981#Location maps]].&mdash;

[Rodw]: On the Chester list a gallery is used for the images. I thought this was \""discouraged\"". We could use the Nunney pic but I have asked about a map, so I would suggest waiting until that is available & see then whether the map, a photo or both fits best. I think the lead needs a bit of a rewrite anyway so may get shorter (or longer) and therefore affect the space available.&mdash;
[Rodw]: We don't have a pic for every Somerset castle either so need to consider the options for these + we have the plans which I don't see on Cheshire. The map has just been installed as a lead image so do we need a photo as well?&mdash;
[Rodw]: Thanks for your help with [[King's Castle, Somerset]] (& other Somerset Castles) however could you take a look at King's Castle & my comment on the talk page re a mismatch between the coordinates & the refs - I think we have 2 Kings Castles in Somerset & they have got mixed.&mdash;

I have a small quiestion however, is there a particular reason that the added images are flagged as minor edits by default? Adding an image is not a minor edit IMHO, minor edits are things like spellingcorrections or typo's etc. Keep up the good work! Best regards,
[Tdevries]: I think the idea is that one mentors the person, not the account...
[Tdevries]: The only reason for my small comment here about \""the user, not the account\"" was that Guido seems to have the opinion that the mentorate only applies to a certain account he is using and does not apply if he uses another account. This seems a bit strange to me, it is more likely that a mentorate (and not Guido's in particular) applies to the person, whatever account he is using. And it would not be unlogical and\/or impossible IMHO to extend a mentorate to other Wikimedia projects aswell. But if a mentorate is needed here,, on this project, is entirely the decission of the en.wikipedia community or \""the powers that be\"" overhere."

[TreyGeek]: After all this time can you not create an article with the appropriate [[WP:CITE|citation and source]] tags, as you failed to do with [[Daniel Weichel]], or create articles that follow the consensus of [[WP:MMA]] and not place location flags in record histories?  While we appreciate you creating and improving articles on notable MMA fighters, it seems as if you are almost excessive in your article creation.  --
[TreyGeek]: [[WP:CITE]] discusses the appropriate citation tags to use that provide information other than a simple URL between <nowiki><ref><\/ref><\/nowiki> can provide.  As for location flags, I have previously put a notice on your talk page about them (though you deleted such notice); if you look at the MMA project talk page (which you consider yourself a member of), specifically [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Mixed_martial_arts#Flags_for_Locations_in_Record_Boxes]] you will see a request by myself that location flags are redundant and should not be placed in record boxes.  No one disagrees, including yourself as a MMA Project member.  Therefore, location flag in record boxes should not be added as they are redundant.  --
[TreyGeek]: After reading [[WP:CITE]] and [[WP:CIT]] you are saying that you are coding your sources correctly?  As for being praised for your \""mass amounts of articles\"" where is that praise?  I just looked through your talk history and can't find it.  --

[TreyGeek]: Hey Para, a suggestion to make reverting vandalism easier without rollback privileges is [[WP:Twinkle]].  It's what I've been using all this time.  After having been granted rollback without requesting it, I struggle to find how it is better than Twinkle.  I'd hate to see you quit attempting to revert vandalism because I know it's a pain without a good tool to do it with.  --
[TreyGeek]: I'm using Twinkle with Chrome without any real problems.  The popup windows are there to help you provide warnings to those whose edits you just reverted.  That feature can also be turned off as Twinkle is highly configurable, IMO.  As I said, just tossing an alternative option out there for you.  --
[TreyGeek]: Quite honestly, the article is poor.  There should be a lot more references cited in the article.  The academics section has no context in terms of what those degrees are: are they degrees offered only at the RRHEC campus?  are they degrees that can be earned in their entirety at the RRHEC campus?  Where did that list come from?  If you are a graduate student and you really want to do a good job on the article, treat the article like a research paper you are going to publish to a major journal.  Cite your facts, format it well, and look at the wealth of information at the top of your talk page.  --
[TreyGeek]: Anyhow, I honestly do hope you are able to take a step back, perhaps [[WP:Breathe]], calm down and come back.  --

[TreyGeek]: It's quacking pretty loud to me looking at the times of edits, type of edits, and account creations.  It's been a while since I've started a sockpuppet investigation.  I'll start on that in a little bit.  Thanks for the heads up.  --
[TreyGeek]: Thanks for the heads up on the apparent sockpuppets.  I've started the investigation and it can be found at [[Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations\/Steve14orhs]].  As far as the UFC profile links go, while I would personally not put them in articles<s>, if the consensus of the project is they belong then fair enough<\/s>.  Interestingly, the MMA Project already allows for adding of promotion profile pages though ordering and priority is not specified.  --
[TreyGeek]: Steve14orhs as much as admitted he worked for the UFC on the MMA project talk page.  He claimed he was not the same person as MMA25MMA.  It looks like the admins ran a checkuser on him and found they were using the same IP address and found all the other IPs.  The admins were quick to resolve it last time.  They'll likely do another checkuser and if the IP matches or is close to the other IP they may do a range block.  We'll see.  Thanks for the update.  --
[TreyGeek]: If that's true, add it to the prose of the article and add a citation to \""almost every MMA site in existence.\"" --

The little discussion we had before has turned into non existent discussion and now he is editing the article as he sees fit without any form of consultation. This particular admin is clearly a supporter of Fred Thompson in the presidential election and he is using wikipedia as a platform to promote him. There is no room for the inclusion of any piece of information that might not paint him in a positive light. The article is not neutral. POV pushing is more then evident.

The page in question actually had no mine photos on it, so I uploaded three that I though were good (I took them myself in 2003), and sprinkled them around the story. Springhill is so well know for the mine and it's history, that the mine has to be prominent in the page. Remember that when you click on the photo, it gets much bigger, which is what most people do.

I thought reprinting your comment above my own would show I was paraphrasing, but regardless you are correct, and I have stricken the quotes and added a note.  I do understand people's frustration with Jeff's continued arguments, but I think the solutions that have been attempted are counter-productive and not in the spirit of Wikipedia. I appreciate your reply, and perhaps you would be interested in commenting on [[Wikipedia_talk:Blocking_policy#.22Cool_down.22_blocks|a discussion]] I have started at [[WP:BLOCK]]. Thanks again. --
[Nscheffey]: Hi, I've been following your recent discussion on the administrators noticeboard and I have agreed with you throughout. Admin incivility is far worse than incivility by normal editors, because it brings with is the tacit support of the community. That is, editors who encounter an uncivil admin may feel as if the entire community is persecuting them, since \""if this person is an admin he must speak for the community\"". Another dangerous trend that Cyde, albeit inadvertantly, pointed out is admin-banding behavior, the idea that admins should support other admins generally or automatically. This is not a good idea and divisive in the truest sense of the word. For these reasons I commend you on your (apparently thankless) efforts. I also thought you might be interested in a [[Wikipedia_talk:Blocking_policy#.22Cool_down.22_blocks|clarification]] of the blocking policy I have proposed. I personally think it would go a long way towards preventing a lot of the editor-admin drama around here, but I would love to hear your thoughts. So, just voicing my support, don't lose it yet CBD! &mdash;"

Tiger Khan,False,"[Tiger Khan]: I concur with 71.243.5.168 about the fact that the best articles will not always be written about the most deserving topics, but rather about the topics that people find the most interesting. However, I would also argue that Wikipedia makes an important contribution to \""serious\"" topics as well. A study showed that the accuracy of Wikipedia was almost identical to the accuracy of Encyclopedia Brittanica. Check it out (this is a news article about the study; I haven't found a direct link to the study): http:\/\/news.cnet.com\/2100-1038_3-5997332.html . I was just wondering what you thought about this, considering your apparent cynicism about Wikipedia's reliability.
[Tiger Khan]: Your points about article bloat and the sometimes excessive NPOV are both very valid. However, although there are articles with poor organization, there are also many that are very easy reads. In particular, at least in some areas, such as pages about secondary schools, there seems to be a general standard that is being followed which creates a series of well organized, simple pages with the key information about the topic. Obviously there are exceptions, but the adoption of standardized info boxes and other organizational tools have greatly aided the professionalization of Wikipedia. That said, in my travels about Wikipedia, I mostly do gnome work, but I have adopted a few articles for major rewrites, most of which are not based on a need for more facts or article expansion, but rather are based on a lack of organization. However, it's not too difficult to make the necessary changes, so I hope that more editors will take it upon themselves to fix articles that need such rewrites such that Wikipedia will come closer to being a true, professional encyclopedia. I hope what I've written isn't too confusing. I think I lost track of my thoughts somewhere in there."

[HolyRomanEmperor]: Nema na cemu. Da li ti treba negdje pomoc jo\u0161? --
[HolyRomanEmperor]: I might help there: Pannonia and Dalmatia were ruled by Slavic (proto-Croatian) Princes. See the [[Trpimir]] article - since his reign - the House of Trpimir styled themselves as ''Dukes of the Croats'' - so since the middle of the [[9th century]], it would be appropriate to call them \""Dukes\"" and \""Croatian\"" - or \""Croatian Dalmatia\"". --
[HolyRomanEmperor]: Yes - that is what is generally accepted in the global history - although, see [[Trpimir]]: ''Trpimir had three sons (Petar, Zdeslav and Muncimir). Duke Trpimir issued a document in Latin donating the church of Sv. Juraj (St. George's) at Putalj to the bishop of Nin. In this document, dated from 4 March 852, duke Trpimir referred to himself as the Duke of Croats (dux Chroatorum) and to his country as the state of the Croats (regnum Chroatorum).'' This is the second mention of Croats in the history - and the final - since then, there were only \""Croatian Dukes\"" of Dalmatia - not just slavic (proto-Croatian) \""Princes\"". I hope this helps. --

[HolyRomanEmperor]: No idea what you meant with this personal attack. I'm not from Gazimestan, not from Serbia. The Serbo-Croatian will never be extinct, as the whole world says (Brockhaus' wikipedia, Infoplease and even wikipedia) The mere reason is [[romantic nationalism]] which made every nation have its own language like in the [[19th century]]. The Serbs and Croats are free to choose whatever they want a name for thweir language to be, but illogical fallacy is to claim that their languages are not one. Sincerely. --

[HolyRomanEmperor]: Yugo was ''split'' in 1992, but what does that have to do with what I said? --
[HolyRomanEmperor]: However, please note that Hipi Zhdripi and Dardanv are very likely the same person.

[HolyRomanEmperor]: The only problem is that there's a little controvesry - ''official'' forming of the Montenegrin people's Language is still in progress, and the pro-independency parties in Montenegro (that choose Montenegrin over Serbian) use the Cyrillic scrypt instead. Like the party of Milo Djukanovich. Although when the Montenegrin language will finally be officialized, there is no controversy over the fact that the Latin scrypt would be the main, the problem is that the Cyrillic scrypt is still the main in usage in the Republic of Montenegro. --

[HolyRomanEmperor]: I nisam siguran da li bi bilo dobro Srbe oznaciti crvenom bojom a Hrvate plavom - kroz historiju, (u etnickim kartama se tako vidi), Plavo je oznacavalo Srbe a crveno Hrvate - bas kao sto je Crveno oznacavalo Rimokatolicku crkvu, a plavo Istocno(srpsko)pravoslavnu.

[HolyRomanEmperor]: to sto se dogodilo Bosni. Sa preko 98% Slavenskoga stanovnistva BiH je bila uvijek (a i ostala) najslovenskija drzava na svijetu - s kulturalne tacke gledista, ni jedna jedina slovenska zemlja nije toliko kulturnih zastavstina ostavila (stecci) koliko Bosna. Bosna je istovremeno u svojoj historiji bila najveci srpski kulturni centar, bila je i hrvatski kulturni centar, a bila je i ostala drzava Slavenskih muslimana.

[HolyRomanEmperor]: Was that you? You left your message unsigned. Well, it is not true that Albania is ahaid of Bosnia and Serbia in joining the EU, but it is very much correct that it's ahead in many, many things - while its backward on many others. Did you ever see Tirana, for instance? The City is by far one of the most beautiful that I have ever seen, and it simply beames with art from the romantic nationalist age and Medieval-style architecture. By far, one of the most beautiful European metropolises, and most certainly among the prettiest in the Balkan peninsular. --

Also, see the [[Rudjer Boskovic]] article and open its history (note my last edits). I have made a balanced compromise - Rudjer Boskovic was being invaded for ages by Serbian POV (including from my own brother's). One funny thing is that I ''haven't'' combated Albanian nationalism as much as you presented. :) ALl the things that I did was to \""restore to the light\"" a little <not intending to insult the User in subject> - but now a good contributor - [[User:Ilir_pz]]. --
[HolyRomanEmperor]: And essentially - when I edit articles, I deal strictly with bot-like translations from books, encyclopediae, or the Croatian or Serbian wikipedias.

[HolyRomanEmperor]: Also, how did the Bosnian nation exist for over 1500 years? --
[HolyRomanEmperor]: Tvrtko was a Roman Catholic Christian Bosnian of German origin, who prided himself on his (partial) Serb origin. He was partly of Croat origin as well. What I meant is that ''the Yugoslav nation'' existd before - and that the Bosnian nation has been created in 1992, and finally formalized in 1995 - with still lacking a lot of shapes of a single, unified nation. --

[HolyRomanEmperor]: I have a question. The [http:\/\/www.crowc.org\/english\/about.asp?subcat=general Croatian World Congress] states that there are 4.5 million Croats ''outside'' Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina (making altogether ''9,000,000 million Croats in the world''. Although this fulfills the WP:CITE rule, I still think this a little unimaginable. A similiar thing with the 12,000,000\/11,000,000 figure for Serbs. Is it OK to put the notice like that (because the Serbian Unity Congress has been valued as insuficient for the Serbs article - the claim of 300,000 Chicago Serbs). --
[HolyRomanEmperor]: P. S. - [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&target=89.172.239.85 here's Afrika paprika as an anon]. --
[HolyRomanEmperor]: Look at the history of your talk page. He officially admitted that he ([http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&target=89.172.239.85]) is Afrika paprika. Editing while your account is banned is not allowed - it's almost as if sockpuppetry. I think this qualifies for a block of the IP. --

[HolyRomanEmperor]: Any way I can influence to change that opinion? --
[HolyRomanEmperor]: You're right over there - that actually comes as a shock - thanks anyway! I think that time will tell you (when you get to know me better) - I've also decided to tell a little more about myself, so that no occasion of \""proving\"" starts to get troublesome. --
[HolyRomanEmperor]: Oh - and I checked out some of those islands - and made [[Zverinac]]. --
[HolyRomanEmperor]: Afrika paprika said \""Greater Serb shit\"" on [[Talk:Pagania]]. My original idea was to continue the discussion after his block expires - but now I'm starting to think that that's impossible. --
[HolyRomanEmperor]: OK - I just see a high potential in Afrika; I think that if he could read a little of Wikipedia's policies and change a little his attitude - he could become a productive member of the society. Actually, he broke [[WP:CIVIL]] ''after'' the block. However, as it's unlikely that I am able to influence him - I ask you. --
[HolyRomanEmperor]: Hmm... I really don't know a lot about Haiduk Veljko. I know that it is claimed that eastern Serbia (and thus Timocka Krajina) is claimed to have been populated by ethnic Bulgarians right up until a while ago. Anyway, it is generally known that since the old Medieval ages Bulgarians or at least Slavs under Bulgarian influence\/rule more than half of present-day Serbia. I don't think that the Bulgarian claim lies in just ''that''. I promise I'll look into the issue - but if you've found some reliable sources, I encourage you to put it into the article as a possibility. After all, the article on Milos (K)Obilic mentions his supposed both Bulgarian and Albanian ethnic origin. :) What does the Bulgarian encyclopedia say 'bout him? Or the Macedonian? P. S. He wasn't a \""Grand\"" Duke (I think). --
[HolyRomanEmperor]: The claim on Milos Obilic is mainly based on national foklkore - all Balkan nations claim him because of his alleged success (AFAIC - he's not even Serbian, but '''Montenegrin''' - whoops! are Montenegrins really Serbs?!?!? :))) This Balchannalia can't stop hurting my brains!!!). Historically, Serbs lived on the Rashka region (modern-day Sandzak), Metohija, parts of Kosovo and Macedonia, Zeta (Montenegro). The majority was actually in Herzegovina and Bosnia. There was no (or little) Serb population in the early medieval ages north of the Danube, or even Western Morava - and most definately no in the Southern Morava (up until the Nemanjics). This is something claimed by Serbian historians (good ones) and I think is also claimed by others (Bulgarian historians?) - thus, there is ''no reason'' to dispute it. --
[HolyRomanEmperor]: Well, what if the people ''doesn't know'' what it wants? :) More and more Montenegrins opt for the Montenegrin language and Montenegrin Orthodox Church - rather than the Serbian; and more and more Montenegrins opt Serbian nationality, rather. Montenegro's situation is confusing; altogether because of its current regime. --"

Moreover it says that some critics tried to combine names of Black hguelphs families to the names of the devils. The only correspondence was ''Rubicante'' to Cante Gabrielli da Gubbio, the podest\xe0 of Florence who signed the exhile act for Dante. I can go on and on... I just wrote a pege on italian wikipedia [[:it:I Malebranche]] where all those names where analized, they are quite funny. Some times they are similar to some family names (Malebrance, Raffacani, Rubaconte) but these are florentine families, not just from Lucca, and this can apply only to some devils, other are taken fro popular devil-characters (Alichino from French Hallequin, Farfarello from a kind on follet), others are invented by Dante.

[Uncle G]: I'm trying to shift the focus of the schools debates from the various \""stuck record\"" arguments that have bogged editors down for so long onto the finding, reading, citing, and evaluation of sources, using the new [[WP:SCHOOL]] criteria to do this in the same way that the [[WP:CORP]] did this for companies and products.

It isn't quite the same thing as you are discussing, but the \""I know.  I'll add a bullet point to a Wikipedia article.\"" approach is a similar one.
[Uncle G]: I've been mulling over how to write up the second for some time, now.  But It's not actually necessary to write an essay for the first.  I wrote it as something that we should consider elaborating and adopting.  It seemed to me that it was something that a lot of editors were progressing towards.  I, for example, had already covered the ground of presenting things in the way that the sources do at [[User:Uncle G\/On notability#Dealing with non-notable things]].<p>After writing it, I went to the Village Pump and to several other talk pages to advertise the idea and trigger some discussion.  By the time that I reached [[Wikipedia talk:Biographies of living persons]] I found that other editors had already added it to the policy and a discussion was already underway.  You can see the result at [[Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons#Articles about living people notable only for one event]].<p>What I find interesting is that [[User:Fred Bauder|Fred Bauder]] reported [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Wooyi&diff=133963064&oldid=133854239 here] that Jimbo and others had been working behind closed doors on a \""major initiative\"".  As far as I can tell, that initiative was [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not&diff=134171531&oldid=134093216 this].  As I said, a lot of editors appeared to be progressing towards the same thing. &#9786;

I'll keep mulling this whole area over.<p>One interesting talk page to read, if you are thinking about article development in this area, is [[Talk:Phenomenon]].  See also the article's edit history over the past 5 years.
[Uncle G]: Well the basic ideas are those of mimicry and of belief in the magical creation of articles.
[Uncle G]: Just to make sure:  You knew that [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\/Lac Motion]] was another such of these discussions when you closed it, didn't you?
[Uncle G]: I'm just making sure that you knew about the sockpuppetry (which didn't get struck out there as it has been in most of the other re-lists so far) and took it into account.
[Uncle G]: Colonel Warden is not an administrator, and cannot undelete the article for re-listing.  Xe has come to me for help.  I don't want to step on any toes here.  Are you happy to re-open and re-list for further consideration?
[Uncle G]: Better that you do, I think.
[Uncle G]: Please stop wasting other people's time like this.  You knew, from [[Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion\/Log\/2010_March_13|the RFD discussion]], that it was possible to edit the redirects into articles when the time came.  Instead, you chose to create a new page and waste other people's time by nominating the existing page, that ''you could have just edited'', for deletion.  Making administrators (and, indeed, every ordinary editor that does Proposed Deletion patrol) waste their time with unnecessary busywork in order to accommodate a bizarre unwillingness to edit existing pages on your part will not make you friends.
[Uncle G]: As I said on the noticeboard, I hope that your immediate reaction upon learning that you were being asked to create fake articles was to withdraw your bid.  I don't know how long it takes for widthdrawals to be processed, but I hope that you've already withdrawn.
[Uncle G]: It's not really notes of support that are wanted, but rather improvements to the article.  This is about ''article rescue''.  I've found an 1865 source (Francis Redfern's ''History of the town of Uttoxeter'') talking about the church in Uttoxeter, but since this pre-dates the 1877 re-build, I still lack a source that links what Redfern documents to the modern building.  It might not be the right church.
[Uncle G]: And that is, of course, the point.  The absolute best, irrefutable, argument is a good stub article with copious sources.  I've no idea how many article rescues I've done over the years, but I've done several where I didn't comment in the AFD discussion at all, and simply made an entirely mute case by expanding and improving the article without mercy.  It's not about acting like an old fogey and berating the young-'uns for nominating the \""obviously notable\"" for deletion.  Sometimes the oldsters conflate notability with personal preference, and their personal likes and dislikes of a subject, which is quite the wrong thing to be doing.  (''Everyone's'' interest is a minority interest, taking the population of the planet as a whole.)  It's about setting an example of how to write, and about getting a good article at the end of the process.  Witness [[loyalty]], [[Tampa General Hospital]], [[Westminster motorcycle parking charge]], [[Souperism]], [[loony left]], and even [[hand-rubbing]].<p>We don't want people piling on to AFD discussions and then doing nothing.  But we most definitely ''do'' want people who can write about U.K. churches banding together and quickly constructing a good solid stub on a church that has demonstrable scope for expansion.  I've been involved in such collaborations many times, on many subjects, and I've found that a small group of experienced editors can, if the subject truly is notable, easily and rapidly come up with such a thing within the AFD discussion period.  Witness [[Alabama Baptist Convention]], for example.  As is said at [[User:Uncle G\/On sources and content#Always work from and cite sources]], if one always provides a good stub with ample sources, one's experience of writing at Wikipedia becomes largely untroubled by deletion nominations.  Griping and going around calling other editors names doesn't do that.  But working from and citing ample sources right from the get-go does.  From experience, I time and again recommend the writing well route over the griping and name-calling route.  It just works so much better in practice.
[Uncle G]: Does that include aggro directed towards novice editors who do new page patrol?  &#9786;
[Uncle G]: If you want to do a ''different'' kind of church for a change, there are sources for [[Powelton Baptist Church]] at [[User talk:Uncle G#Baptist State Convention of North Carolina article]].
[Uncle G]: Most of what I did was citation cleanup.  I hope that future editors can follow the pattern, now that it's laid out.  If you've seen your watchlist notice, you'll have seen that I'm a bit busy at the moment, busy enough that it has severely impacted my content editing.  So I cannot help much with that.  Even the Baptists are on hold.  &#9786;
[Uncle G]: 
[Uncle G]: I suggest that you and others go and have a long talk with {{user|Trackinfo}}.  See [[Wikipedia talk:Contributor copyright investigations\/Darius Dhlomo\/How to help]] for why.  Trackinfo seems to be of the opinion that things that are largely sentence-for-sentence identical and [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Pat_McCormick_(diver)&action=historysubmit&diff=384440144&oldid=383316801 turned into a derived work by Trackinfo] are [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Pat_McCormick_(diver)&diff=384472373&oldid=384449208 \""I reworded all of those sentences.\""]  There are also statements by Trackinfo that the \""legwork\"" in creating \""these highly accurate wikifications of public record documents\"" is \""so valuable\"" that \""I would be willing to overlook the occasional tendency toward copyright violations in prose\"".  You and others are best placed to disabuse xem of these notions, right now, before things get out of hand.<p>As for the rest: That ''was'' the short run, that [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard\/Incidents\/CCI&diff=prev&oldid=384190984 I said I'd be doing] a while back, to test the 'bot script and demonstrate it in action so that people can look at the edit rate and so forth.  (I even found and fixed a problem with the category handling, you'll notice.)
[Uncle G]: Actually, it was 22 articles (one of which is now redlinked on the list) twice.  I ran the process twice, expecting the second run to be a batch of null edits that wouldn't show up.  They did, revealing a problem, that I then found the cause for and [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Steven_Salmons&diff=prev&oldid=384397480 fixed] (by explicitly filtering out that particular category).
[Uncle G]: As noted below, I've been a Wikinews editor for a long time.  Even on wikis, it's not a good idea to let the subject write the piece.  &#9786;  I know that I wouldn't want subjects writing the piece if I were the reporter.  So I've gone with the usual route of supplying the fact corrections for the reporter to review, research, and update the piece accordingly.  I even tried to do so well before your deadline.  &#9786;<p>As to recognizing what isn't my writing:  It wouldn't be creepy.  You'll be surprised how many people know this.
[Uncle G]: I have a short test list of articles that I've run through the 'bot; so you can see from [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&dir=next&offset=20100914112326&limit=22&target=Uncle+G's+major+work+'bot the 'bot's own contributions history] what the 'bot does.  Notice that [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Richard_Schuil&diff=384766008&oldid=384491685 I've addressed one discovered problem and one further request].  This is ''just'' the created articles pass, at this stage.  I'm not even set up to roll back articles, yet.  I'm looking into how that can be done; and the 'bot would need a new tool written to be able to do it.  Plus, of course, that second pass as a whole is still up for discussion.<p>Moonriddengirl has already said that xe is working up a list of pages to be immediately rolled back.  If xe gives me a list of pages like [[Margaret de Jes\xfas]] ahead of time I can remove them from the list given to the 'bot in the first place.  For reasons noted above on this very page and on Moonriddengirl's talk page, Moonriddengirl is a good clearinghouse for such a list.  I suggest that you two help Moonriddengirl concoct that list.
[Uncle G]: I was wondering whether VernoWhitney can come up with a way of refactoring the CCI list to take out the blanked articles after they are blanked, so that people didn't have the extra task of ticking articles off, there, and we could just rely upon the category to depopulate.  Xe did say that the current list on the CCI pages was in two parts, with separately numbered sequences.
[Uncle G]: I'm probably going to do the list in batches, but only so that I can recover from errors and restart the process partway through more easily, if such becomes necessary.  I might not even need to do that.  It's best for you and others to approach this as if all of the articles are going be done in one long run.  As I said on your talk page, I'm ready, with list and scripts.
[Uncle G]: Who said ''just'' the category?  &#9786;  See [[Wikipedia:Contributor copyright investigations\/Darius Dhlomo\/How to help#Things that you can patrol]].
[Uncle G]: You, of ''all'' people, should know who was mucking about like children there.  Please put the old thinking engine into gear.  I shall say no more.
[Uncle G]: It's exactly that sort of hyperbole that was unwarranted on Darius Dhlomo's user talk page.  The rest of us can see that right now you are talking directly to Bwilkins, in two different [[wikt:forum#Latin|for\u012bs]] no less, and discussing your differences.  You've even had suggestions on how to address that from third parties.
[Uncle G]: I actually said, \""Editors should not be here to take actions X, Y, or Z.\"", which quite clearly refers in the main to the editors taking actions X, Y, or Z; although I'm sure that Darius Dhlomo appreciates the fact that xyr user talk page is now quiet and not the complete disaster area that it was rapidly shaping up to be.  If you want an object lesson on how these things get out of hand, see [http:\/\/en.wikinews.org\/w\/index.php?title=User:Matthewedwards&diff=1033657&oldid=1033656 how CheckUsers\/Administrators\/Bureaucrats handle blocks at Wikinews].  (There's a lot more to that sorry story.  I won't relate it here.  But almost none of it has been good.  It's a good lesson for other wikis to learn from.)<p>There are in fact quite a lot of people who are angry.  The irony here is that I'm one of the people with the most ''real'' cause to be angry, and indeed I was quite annoyed when I went through those several hundred articles and found the copyright violations, as well as being annoyed that I knew well ahead of time that this sort of grief was coming to ''my'' talk page as a consequence of this; yet, of all people, I'm the one ''stopping'' people going to Darius Dhlomo's user talk page and demonizing xem.<p>You have an idealized world view that, unfortunately, doesn't match stark reality.  We all started there.  [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard\/Incidents&diff=prev&oldid=382930817 Even I] didn't know that this was on the scale that it was, at first, until I went looking myself and ended up doubling the theretofore claimed size of the problem from a rapid scan of a few hundred articles that skipped a lot of them.  So here's some catching up.<p>If you look at [[#Signpost]] above, and on [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard\/Incidents\/CCI]], you'll see where three separate people have rolled up their sleeves and ploughed through a small sample of the pages.  We've all come to the very same rough figure of a copyright violation rate of 10%.  Out of 10,000 article creations that's a lot.  And as you yourself observed, the additional more than 13,000 other articles are also problematic.  We have over 23,000 articles with non-trivial contributions here.  Even ''five'' percent of that is a lot.<p>Now contrast that with Darius Dhlomo's [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Darius_Dhlomo&diff=382931711&oldid=382929414 \""no more than fifteen\""] (which, as I said, I rapidly doubled).  Go back through the history of the talk page.  See Sillyfolkboy's attempts to engage in order to obtain information about where prose was taken from and [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Darius_Dhlomo&diff=383041845&oldid=383041271 Darius Dhlomo's responses].<p>As I said, you have an ideal view that does not, unfortunately, match reality.  If as an onlooker new to the situation you want to attempt to persuade Darius Dhlomo to engage and to help clean up xyr own mess, then that's well and good.  [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Darius_Dhlomo&diff=384056522&oldid=384024825 I've already said] that other people are better placed than I to do this.  Good luck to you in doing so.  When the current outrage dies down, after the news has become less news, you'll even have Darius Dhlomo's user talk page, without the in-rush of the angry, the provocative, and the childish to cope with, available to make that attempt on.  &#9786;
[Uncle G]: I'd like to.  I'm waiting on [[Wikipedia:Bots\/Requests for approval\/Uncle G's major work 'bot]], where there has been dead silence for several days.<p>We really have two separate things here.<p>I'm willing to take a list of articles already reviewed and exclude those articles from the 'bot run.  But Jc37 makes a fairly persuasive case against that, below, and you don't like the idea either.  I have no complaints.  Performing the exclusion would be more work for me to do, after all. &#9786;<p>Then we have the issue of what to do about the redundancy between the CCI list and the category, when it comes to the r&ocirc;le of worklist to be ticked off.  That's probably something to ask other people about.
[Uncle G]: I've fixed the diff for you.  &#9786;
[Uncle G]: I'll get to it if I can.  But I make no promises.  As you may have noticed, I have a rather large task looming.  I've already had to drop several other things that I would normally be doing because of it.
[Uncle G]: Welcome to the joy of userspace.  If your work is useful and good, people have no qualms about pointing to it and using it.  That's happened to me before now (and to many others).  &#9786;  If you want to rename it to, say, [[Wikipedia:Contributor copyright investigations\/Darius Dhlomo\/Created articles list]], go ahead.  Don't forget to then adjust all of the links in the several navigation boxes, in the executive summary, and on the \""how to help\"" page, though.
[Uncle G]: I did no different to what you did.  I took a simple copy of what was in the revisions hyperlinked to.  (I was probably the one who hyperlinked to them.)  As you note, it's not a particularly long procedure.
[Uncle G]: We're at what seems to be the last call at [[Wikipedia:Bots\/Requests for approval\/Uncle G's major work 'bot]].  So we're almost to the point where 1,000 people will descend onto this talk page.  &#9786;
[Uncle G]: It's a [[MW:Help:Magic words|magic word]], not a real template.  If it were a real template, the username would be part of the template name.
[Uncle G]: Thank you.  I was pleased when I discovered that I'd unknowingly turned one of the redlinks at [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Missing encyclopedic articles\/Hot\/E]] blue.  &#9786;
[Uncle G]: There is.  It's called deletion.  &#9786;
[Uncle G]: Just the names ''is'' very convenient for me.  I'm blanking all of the articles on your current list (as it stood a little while ago) in one batch, right now, so it should be fairly easy to quickly stalk the 'bot's contributions. This batch should be processed in under {{#expr:628\/4\/60}} hours.
[Uncle G]: The 'bot should be done well before then.  So don't expend all of that time if it's purely for my benefit.
[Uncle G]: And it probably isn't worth doing unless you want a list that you can scan to quickly unblank, which (if you are scanning the CCI list for \""n\""s) you already have anyway.<p>On the point of quickly unblanking, [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Uncle_G's_major_work_'bot&curid=2561802&diff=385942153&oldid=110002611 this] will give you something to chuckle over.
[Uncle G]: I agree.  You might want to point [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Contributor_copyright_investigations\/Darius_Dhlomo\/Created_articles_list&action=historysubmit&diff=385941264&oldid=385258763 this editor] to the right place.  (Related changes on that page makes for interesting reading at the moment, by the way.)
[Uncle G]: Such mirroring is well known.  In fact I was discussing it only a scant few hours ago.  See [[Wikipedia talk:Featured article candidates#Another kind of reward]], [[User:Fences and windows\/Unreliable_sources#Wikipedia_mirrors]], and [[Wikipedia:Village pump (miscellaneous)\/Archive 28#Plagiarism]].<p>By the way: I hope that you've seen from the above that you were on the wrong page.
[Uncle G]: In the meantime, {{user|Pelmeen10}} has had a lucky escape.  Fortunately, the articles that xe went around immediately unblanking are ones that have been checked, so xe unwittingly helped in the endeavour.  See [[User talk:Uncle G's major work 'bot]].  There's always one who reads \""([[Wikipedia:Contributor copyright investigations\/Darius Dhlomo\/Task explanation|What this 'bot is doing]])\"" and asks \""What are you doing?\"" anyway. &#9786;
[Uncle G]: I was rather persuaded by jc37's points, earlier on this page.  So I'm running everything that Moonriddengirl has already found immediately, ahead of the rest, in one single batch, so (a) it will be easy to stalk the 'bot's contributions for these pages, and (b) it will get these pages out of the way right now.  For numbers, see what I added to [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard\/Incidents\/CCI]] a little while ago.<p>One benefit of this, that I didn't even think of, is that the people who do what {{user|Pelmeen10}} just did will be unwittingly helping the effort.  Best that that sort of thing happens now, before we get to the articles where reflexive unblanking is a ''bad'' thing.
[Uncle G]: I'll look at the overlap and see whether it's worthwhile doing anything.  If I leave the 'bot running continuously, it could do the remainder of the task in some 32 hours at this point, by my calculations.  In the meantime, you could always enlist the help of {{user|Bigger digger}} in the unblanking of reviewed articles from your earlier list.
[Uncle G]: Thank you.  I'm hoping that that will be the last of those.  It might be worth checking that contributions history again after the 'bot has processed everything, though.  If you have the opportunity, a week from now, please have another quick look at it.
[Uncle G]: The various CCI pages already have been, as far as I am aware.  I didn't do it, but I saw some edits by others doing it.  The CCI main case page was marked as such right from the start.  I suspect that that's CCI standard operating procedure.  I'll double-check the other CCI pages.
[Uncle G]: I've double-checked and added some missing ones.  One thing that we could do to divert Wikipedia's significant search engine presence in this area is write an article on [[Darius Dhlomo]] (q.v.).  I've been thinking about doing that.  I'll see whether I can rustle up a very measely stub.  &#9786;
[Uncle G]: You could always look at [[Special:RecentChangesLinked\/Category:Olympic athletes of Lithuania]], [[Special:RecentChangesLinked\/Category:Lithuanian decathletes]], and so forth.  That was one of the reasons that people wanted the categories retained.
[Uncle G]: No worries.  As I said [[#In regards to CCI|above]], it was a measely stub.  I noted it on [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Football]] in the hopes that someone would &hellip; erm &hellip; pick up the ball and run with it.
[Uncle G]: I noticed.  Thank you.
[Uncle G]: There are further things to look at listed at [[Wikipedia:Contributor copyright investigations\/Darius Dhlomo\/How to help#Things that you can patrol]].  You could intersect [[:Category:Olympic athletes of Lithuania]] with the CCI cleanup category, for example.
[Uncle G]: That's a worry that simply hasn't been borne out by experience.  The only such reversions so far have been two people using Igloo, for which a suggestion at [[User talk:Ale jrb\/Scripts\/igloo#suggestion 2]] has been made.  Both people quickly rolled back the Igloo changes.
[Uncle G]: I enjoyed the edit summary [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Anke_Scholz&curid=21537894&diff=386549608&oldid=386327377 here].
[Uncle G]: I'm unsure.  At the start I wasn't aware that there was a real person by this name, but I was still concerned about the Wikipedia editor having xyr (account) name all over the World Wide Web.  That's why xyr name isn't in the blanking notice, for example, and all of the pages are {{tl|NOINDEX}}ed.<p>Then I found [[:nl:Darius Dhlomo]].  At that point, I was even ''more'' determined that this name should not be splashed about via Wikipedia articles.  [[#In regards to CCI]] above spurred me into the obvious action, which should redirect (and indeed, from my recent checks with search engines, has redirected) Wikipedia's considerable search engine weight somewhere more constructive.  For preference, I'd like another, independent, administrator to decide on whether [[Wikipedia:Username policy#Real names]] applies.  I suggest that the two of you quietly drop by [[Wikipedia:Usernames for administrator attention]].<p>I do wonder why, after several discussions on several sports WikiProjects and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\/Sweden national football team 1994|one football-related AFD discussion]] involved this editor over the years, none of the sporting articles editors spotted this in all this time.
[Uncle G]: [[Template talk:Did you know#Articles created\/expanded on September 22|Sillyfolkboy is ahead of you]].
[Uncle G]: On that note, see [[User:Moonriddengirl\/CCI 'bot stalk report]].
[Uncle G]: Your aim is off.  &#9786; I did wonder about Cyriack, but I didn't go looking.  I suspect that there's a big rescue, along the lines of {{On AFD|Loyalty}}, looming.  And I'm still in the middle of the CCI work.
[Uncle G]: I'm going to have to find some more biographies for you to keep you occupied and out of such mischief, I see.  &#9786;  Of course, if I wanted to soak up ''all'' of your spare time like a sponge, I'd throw {{On AFD|Betrayal}} at you. &hellip;
[Uncle G]: It's a practice of long-standing.  See [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\/Jamie Kane]] for one of its more memorable uses.  I tend to understate it nowadays.  See [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\/Kaicho]] for a more recent example.  If you look at the chronological position of the horizontal rules within the discussions, and line them up against the edit histories of the articles, all should become clear.
[Uncle G]: One of the fun parts is when it turns out that all of the delete opinions are before the rule and all of the keep opinions are after it.
[Uncle G]: I realize that I'm braver about this than most.  But I've had more experience than most, too, and I'm surer based upon my experience about where the outcome is likely to be positive and where it is not.  ({{On AFD|Cardiff Kook|Cardiff kook}} is now a DYK nomination, for example.)  For the fainter of heart, I suggest a first step of asking {{user|Xanderliptak}} to revisit [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\/Four boxes]], since xe is one of the two people that you have to persuade.
[Uncle G]: If I'd had the time, I'd have pointed you at [[Emily Perkins Bissell]], anti-suffragette who added \""sentry box\"", or [[James G. Watt]] who suggested that perhaps the cartridge box should be used against \""environmentalists\"", or William F. Butler who mentioned three boxes (in the reverse order to Watt) in his inaugural address to the Kentucky Negro Republican Party in 1867.
[Uncle G]: If you want a biographical challenge in the meantime, see whether you can dig up something on [[Priscilla Leonard]]'s lecture \""The Mistaken Vocation of Shakespeare's Heroines\"", which we don't seem to have anything about.  &#9786;
[Uncle G]: Bongomatic is obviously very bored.  I have therefore created [[User talk:Bongomatic#A cure for boredom|a cure for xem]].
[Uncle G]: I wasn't sure about either of those, which is why I didn't redlink them.  I didn't come across any sources documenting Butler directly.  I could have a look, but I currently have 10 sources to deal with for [[society reporting]], and I already have a fair idea of what I'm going to do after that, given that the DYK hook for the [[Cardiff Kook]] was watered down unilaterally at the last minute.
[Uncle G]: Your reputation is not artificial, but earned over months, widely observed, and characteristic in this very message; and I'm not buying this \""back room\"" nonsense of yours when you were right there at [[User talk:VernoWhitney#Two battlegrounders]] five days ago.  Now cut this silliness out.
[Uncle G]: [[Wikipedia:Six degrees of Wikipedia|Almost certainly there is]].  That's not what I'm planning, though.  I still have all of those Baptists &uarr; on my plate, too.
[Uncle G]: The fact that, as [[#Darius Dhlomo|above]], the Dutch Wikipedia was where I found [[:nl:Darius Dhlomo]], which we didn't have at the time, leads me to believe that when it comes to Dutch athletes, at least, the Dutch Wikipedia's coverage has been written by other people.
[Uncle G]: Let's now see whether the other disputants come to the table.
[Uncle G]: Where's [[User:Capitalistroadster|Capitalistroadster]] when we need {{gender:Capitalistroadster|him|her|xem}}, eh?  I am currently steering clear of Bands, Biographies, and Businesses for Deletion, simply because I don't have the time right now to do the research.  I might take a look.
[Uncle G]: I've eliminiated the duplication in [[Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship#Notable anti-Stratfordians]].  I leave it up to you and the other interested parties to fix the mini-quotefarm that remains there (Those two are not in the ''Declaration''&#39;s 20.  You're best off prosifying using the ''WSJ'' source cited to put the people listed into some sort of context.) and to deal with [[List of Oxfordian theory supporters]].<p>Note in your ruminations on merger and so forth that, according to the [[Shakespeare Authorship Coalition]] at any rate (if [http:\/\/markrylance.wordpress.com\/2010\/06\/24\/mark-rylance-and-the-shakespeare-authorship-controversy\/ this fourth-hand source is to be believed] &mdash; It is a good idea to double-check Shapiro2010 directly, I think.), the ''Declaration'' is intended to be a broad church, not solely Oxfordian.
[Uncle G]: I wonder how long it is going to take for the penny to drop &hellip;
[Uncle G]: Did you know &hellip; that Monteil regularly visited [[Louis Faidherbe]], in his apartment, in the 1880s; but [[Mogho Naba]] [[Wobogo]] refused to see him at all in 1891 (instead signing a treaty with [[G. E. Ferguson]])?  &#9786;<p>Oh, and<p>Did you know &hellip; that [[Wobogo]]'s given name was Boukary Koutou, and that he lived in perpetual fear of assassination according to Dr Crozat?<p> &#9786;
[Uncle G]: &hellip; a fact that can be frustrating at times.  When I rescued {{On AFD|Cardiff Kook|Cardiff kook}} I went looking for pictures.  There are a fair few pictures of the ''Kook'' on Flickr.  But ''almost no-one'' had decided to release their pictures under a free copyright licence.
[Uncle G]: Did you know &hellip; that [[Oko Jumbo|Oko]] opposed [[Jaja of Opobo|Jaja]] in [[Bonny]], and declared Bonny to be no longer JuJu on Easter Day 1867?
[Uncle G]: Did you know &hellip; that the fact that [[George Pepple|George]], who was not a fan of the Iguanas, allowed [[Oko Jumbo|Oko]] to effectively control [[Bonny]] was one reason [[Jaja of Opobo|Jaja]] left to [[Opobo|go solo]]?
[Uncle G]: You are not reading.  The edit summaries are amply clear that I'm using ''the source cited'', right there in the article, as justification for having the article say the same thing as the source says.  As I pointed out in the ''first'' edit summary, the talk page arguments were not verifiability in action.  Neither are your counting Google hits or looking at what redirects we have and haven't yet created.  Google hits have zero meaning.  All of the things cited at [[Wikipedia:Search engine test#References]] should be enough to disabuse anyone of any erroneous notions to the contrary.<p>It is a falsehood to say that ''anyone at all'' has pointed out a discrepancy.  Not even you did in your edit summary.  Certainly the other editor didn't.  See what is actually written on the article's talk page.  ''I'' am the only person to have pointed out a discrepancy, namely the discrepancy between the spelling changes made and what the source cited says.  It's ''only now'' that you're doing the ''right'' thing, that actually makes a proper argument, which is citing more sources.  That's what you should have done ''at the time'', rather than make an unsourced change where it had already once been pointed out that the change made the article not match the source actually cited for the content.<p>However, you should note that Dudek2009 makes no mention of profanity and is talking about toothpaste on eBay.  There's no indication that xe's using the spelling from the show itself, or the spelling of the profanity rather than of the toothpaste brand name.  Bernardin2009 is talking about toothpaste, too.   Trejbal2006 is better than either of those two, as is Linn2008, since at least they are talking about profanity rather than toothpaste.  So the question, which should be raised on the article's talk page, as really this here should have been, is whether they defeat Tabott2008, since that latter is the only one of the three that explicitly pays attention to spelling, and the only one where it seems likely that the journalist at one point asked \""How do you spell that, please, Mr Larson?\"".
[Uncle G]: I've been tempted to point out to the DYK people that we appear to be travelling backwards in time, here.  I notice that they are now travelling backwards in time, too.
[Uncle G]: Poor [[User:Ron Ritzman|Ron Ritzman]]! &#9786;<p>I see that you blocked {{user|Frnnrthprd}}.  I, given [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?diff=390963663&oldid=390939755 this], which is BLP vandalism, the username issue, and the fact that the account has done not one whit of content work outside of the relevant articles, would have been thinking of a simple indefinite block.  It's your call, though.<p>What think you of [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?diff=prev&oldid=390975812 this]?  Consideration for the article subject (if that ''is'' the article subject) is one thing, but that's exactly what we don't want, here: one of the protagonists, in whatever external issue this is, coming to Wikipedia and threatening other editors with legal action.  I'm thinking at the moment of issuing a final warning.  Your thoughts?
[Uncle G]: I encourage you and the other talk-page stalkers to go and give views about {{On AFD|Frozen North Productions}} and {{On AFD|Flip's Twisted World}} as well, because at the moment most of the opinions in those two AFD discussions have been given by partisans in the external dispute.
[Uncle G]: Thank you.  I'm looking for things on the listed buildings, in order to start a section on those, at the moment.  Then there'll at least be an outline for other editors to build upon.
[Uncle G]: See [[#Google Street View|above &uArr;]] and [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard\/IncidentArchive642#Google Street View]] for some of the background, here.  I didn't actually fulfil a protected edit request.  I took disputed content entirely out of an article that was being edit warred over.
[Uncle G]: Go and read the main CCI discussion where both of these points have already been discussed.  And also note that the 'bot run has long since been done.
[Uncle G]: Did someone nominate it, then?  I didn't.  What happened?
[Uncle G]: You should have let me know that it hadn't been nominated.<p>Did you know, by the way, &hellip; that in the [[Cincinnati Riots of 1884]] many troops from the [[Ohio National Guard]] refused to report for riot duty, and one was even spotted joining the rioters?
[Uncle G]: I was going to mention that Cincinnatti does have a couple more riots in its history.  But you wouldn't want to know that &hellip; any more than you'd want to know that hidden in one of the sources cited as further reading is the name of the first person to die in the 1884 riot.  I'm keeping that to myself, so that I get to write a bit more content. &#9786;  There's more to say about Thomas C. Campbell's status within the city prior to the riot, too.  I recall that I saw the name of the shop owner who shot the three rioters in a source somewhere, as well. &hellip;
[Uncle G]: You missed [[Cincinnati Strangler|1967]] and [[Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.|1968]].  &#9786;
[Uncle G]: I'm afraid that modern-day [[:Category:Riots in India|Riots in India]] have less pull than the article that could come out of the discussion {{On AFD|Boston Gentlemen's Driving Club}} for the enterprising writer.  &#9786;
[Uncle G]: It all comes from doing [[Wikipedia:AfD Patrol|AFD patrol]] and article rescue.   In essence, what I end up working on is often the result of what someone else has nominated for deletion, and fall out from my reearching it.  The Baptist articles were nominated for deletion, for example.  I just wrote [[driving club]] because of {{On AFD|Boston Gentlemen's Driving Club}} being nominated for deletion.
[Uncle G]: Do you think that you can mediate to resolve the dispute?
[Uncle G]: For the CCI case, I blame (and [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?diff=prev&oldid=383250839 blamed at the time]) Rd232 for the original suggestion, which [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?diff=prev&oldid=383256794 I picked up on].  &#9786;  Yes, I remembered PWD too, although as you point out this isn't quite the same thing.
[Uncle G]: Drop by [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard\/Unsourced biographies of living persons#Trial blanking]].
[Uncle G]: I'm sorry that I've been delayed in coming back to this.  Something seems to have come up each time.  I'm currently quite busy with a copyright violation challenge to the currently featured article on the main page, for example.  You may have read the kerfuffle on the administrators' noticeboard.  &#9786;  I do have it as an outstanding matter to come back to, though.
[Uncle G]: That's something that I and many other administrators do, yes.
[Uncle G]: I sense a challenge.  Hmmm.  I wonder if there are any Baptists in Cincinnati. &hellip;
[Uncle G]: Strictly, yes.  But the quicker route, especially for those without administrator tools, is to rewrite the prose body from scratch (The old prose does indeed all appear to come from that source.) and tell me, Moonriddengirl, or some other administrator about it so that we can revision delete the prior edits.
[Uncle G]: I was looking at {{On AFD|Quadripoint}} some little while back, and wondering whether we have the issues surrounding the [[Kazungula Ferry]] fully and correctly covered.  Certainly the two articles appear to contradict each other on their faces.
[Uncle G]: That did seem rather sudden.  It was just a suggestion, added to the discussion.  What do JamesBWatson and Hairhorn think?
[Uncle G]: Maybe then, although possibly not even then.  It wouldn't now.  Go and take a look at [[User:Uncle G\/Grace Sherwood]].  The only major things that the church text will get you above what's there now are all of the \""Before the day be through\"" type dialogue, which isn't in any of the history books that I've read, and (by the citations at the foot of the church WWW page) seems to originate with the re-enactors, as I've noted elsewhere.
[Uncle G]: The place where, as far as I can see, the thing needs rounding out is the folkloric Sherwood.  Unfortunately, as noted at [[Talk:Grace Sherwood#Source query]], I don't have full access to Tucker1969, which would seem to be a good source for that.
[Uncle G]: This ''is not'' separating the footnotes and references.  Ironically, what you're talking about is {{diff|Parfait-Louis Monteil|prev|390700115|this sort of edit}}, which I don't do because I think it to be wrong.  As you say, the use of {{tl|harvnb}} here is a way to ensure that we don't have either (a) multiple {{tl|cite book}}s that differ in page numbers or (b) single {{tl|cite book}}s that point to multiple pages of the same book making it difficult to find the page being cited for any given content.  I've done enough writing from books as sources, and grown my own fair share of <tt>pages=32&ndash;35,87,126&ndash;128,543<\/tt> citations expansion by expansion, to know that the latter is fairly important and also ''common'' for subjects that are treated more than incidentally by the books.  It's not in my experience rarely the case at all.<p>So I go with a ''single'' References section (not separate Notes and References sections as you made them there), with the books <tt>ref=harv<\/tt>ed into a ''sub''section of that.  It doesn't matter in such a system that other future editors don't do the same.  If someone adds a new citation and simply uses <source lang=html4strict enclose=none><ref>{{cite book|\u2026}}<\/ref><\/source> inline in the prose body, then that ''nonetheless'' slots in quite simply to the top of the References section alongside the {{tl|harvnb}} cross-links, especially if one uses <source lang=html4strict enclose=none>{{reflist|1|refs=\u2026}}<\/source> rather than multiple columns.  (Multiple columns can be reserved as a space saver for the case when ''everything'' is {{tl|harvnb}}ed, such as {{oldid|The Nerds|395578046|here}} for example.)  In other words:  It's a system that allows editors of varying proficiencies with citation templates the flexibility to mix and match.  It's the separated Notes and References sections system, which as I said I think to be wrong (not least because ''true'' notes are something else entirely), that ''forces'' people into one triple-entry scheme, and where it ''does'' matter if someone else in the future uses the inline-in-the-prose-body style.<p>
[Uncle G]: There's a fair amount more to write about the \""Nerds' Nativity\"" incident from the sources in [[The Nerds#Further reading]].
[Uncle G]: In looking after it, do you think that you could fix any of the problems identified?
[Uncle G]: Given that {{user|Misssinformative}}, {{user|EmilySchooley}}, and {{user|Bytemeh}} are all one person, it seems clear, from the fact that xe went to deletion review as Bytemeh immediately after requesting and obtaining userfication as Misssinformative, that that person had no intention of working on the userfied article.  So the first question to ask yourself is whether you want to retain a draft article, that by your own account is unlikely to reach article-worthy status, in your userspace.
[Uncle G]: 
[Uncle G]: The source actually said 5.500.000 .  I transliterated.  &#9786;
[Uncle G]: 
[Uncle G]: A URL for what?
[Uncle G]: I hope that you fix the filming date information in time.  I've given you the phrase to look out for.  I suspect that the peso figure is the original, by the way.
[Uncle G]: I do when the whim strikes, as you know from experience.  There is, of course, only one of me and many patrols to do.  &#9786;  The problem in this specific instance isn't reading FA, or even being involved in FA.  It's checking that the boldfaced article isn't simply regurgitating a fact that was in one of the ''other'' linked articles already, making the answer to \""Did you know X?\"" be \""Yes, thank you.  The other article that you linked to has said it for some years.\"".<p>The problem in general is not ''my'' patrolling DYK at all, but the people who so want change, or indeed who so vehemently argue that they can fix without change, aren't doing the same.  They aren't ''doing'' a thing.  Point to a problem entry &mdash; one of at least three currently listed, one of which is an outright factually inaccurate article &mdash; and they do nothing at all about it, except more talk page argument of course.  That inaction makes the former group people who just waste hundreds of KiBs in talk page discussion that they themselves won't in fact follow through on; and the latter group people who are going to encourage greater pressure for change by their complacency.  Both are being foolish, and yet will almost certainly express surprise and outrage when the obvious consequences of their inactions come to pass.<p>
[Uncle G]: You and that other editor (There are only the two of you.) are wrong and by your inaction when it comes down to it are actually part of the problem that people have identified and discussed over the past fortnight.  You support changes in talk page polls, but when it comes to practical applcation, you fight tooth and nail to defend the status quo even in the most obviously problematic of cases.
[Uncle G]: Don't confuse detail with aggression.  And don't read attacks when the subject of you yourself ''didn't even come up in the first place''.
[Uncle G]: 
[Uncle G]: It's not just journalists.  I did a little research of the subject in order to find those papers.  There are several pop-psychology, management self-help, and other books that tell the same, arithmetically unsound, version of the story, probably all parrotting one another.  This is not unusual.  That's why it's important to go to the original research and to proper academic sources that cite the original research.  Of course, this makes for a better DYK in some ways.  We can tell stuff that actually dispells the pop-psychology self-help mythos, stuff that people did not actually know.  See also {{harvnb|Mischel|Shoda|Rodriguez|1992|pp=150&ndash;151}} where they summarize their earlier work, which should help with the broad outline here.
[Uncle G]: {{user|Sillyfolkboy}}, {{user|Pichpich}}, {{user|Hut 8.5}}, and {{user|*Kat*}} are four that you could ask.
[Uncle G]: Do they all have their own sites on [[U7 (Berlin U-Bahn)|the U tube]]? &#9786;
[Uncle G]: At least you are on the right continent, now.  I've just spent some time researching what to do about {{On AFD|Boita}}.  It's like putting [[maritime history of California]] under [[boat]].
[Uncle G]: I have helped you two with a very poor stub on [[Bagyi Aung Soe]].  You're welcome.
[Uncle G]: I was referring to you and your co-conspirator, who I am pleased to I see has {{diff|Bagyi Aung Soe|396997301|396989364|subjected my poor substub to massive expansion}} already.
[Uncle G]: By the way: You can read all about [[U Nyan Shein]] on {{harvnb|Htun|2007|pp=89}}.
[Uncle G]: No worries.
[Uncle G]: Wikiversity did.  Citizendium did.  I'm not stating that their choices of names (\""[[v:Wikiversity:Custodianship|custodian]]\"" and \""{{plainlinks|http:\/\/en.citizendium.org\/wiki\/CZ:Constable|constable}}\"" respectively) are ''better''.  But they are existence proofs that such a thing is ''possible'', albeit that [[MediaWiki]] and its various interfaces still use the software's own terminology.  Now whether it is practicable for ''this'' project, with so much inertia behind the current names, and such a comparatively large community, is a different matter.
[Uncle G]: I was already there, notice.
[Uncle G]: Yes, several of the edit-warring accounts are autoconfirmed.  If you can help with what I asked at [[User talk:Scott MacDonald#Louise Glover]] that would be good.  It's a little more complex than just putting the citations back, which is why I didn't do so.  I believe that the subject objects the hyperlinking to several sensationalist tabloid news stories.  And I think that we ought to check what we are actually citing before thinking of putting the citations back.
[Uncle G]: Do we have anything newer that contradicts the 1976 conclusions about the Milky Way, though?  That's what's important for the task at hand.
[Uncle G]: That's weak.  This is not some Wikipedia-specific thing that a novice to Wikipedia cannot be expected to know.  This is basic when-was-the-book-written stuff, which isn't Wikipedia-specific in the slightest.
[Uncle G]: Nobody said that your intentions ''were not'' good.  That would &mdash; possibly &mdash; be \""biting\"".  But pointing out bad research and a wholly flawed argument is not.  Trying to turn a refutation of such bad research and flawed argument into \""biting\"" is a poor show.
[Uncle G]: I've not had the time to do anything other than read through.  I've been working up [[User talk:Pfagerburg#So ...]] and looking for copyright violations on [[I felt a Funeral in my Brain]].
[Uncle G]: See {{On AFD|Antimatter comet}} for a recent example with multiple pages from single sources.
[Uncle G]: Indian placenames.  There'll be multiple spellings of all.  But we do find ourselves in India again, don't we?  &#9786;
[Uncle G]: It doesn't count if the sixth one is not Kevin Bacon, you know.
[Uncle G]: I've added it, although it's not a full text search like the others.  There are actually several more that I would have liked to have included, except that they don't have ways to encode their database searches into URLs.
[Uncle G]: I always look for multiple published works, independent of the subject and by people with good reputations, documenting the subject in depth, yes.  &#9786;
[Uncle G]: I actually had [[Chandabali]] on my to-do list.  You've saved me some trouble, by already covering some of the things that I had sources for.  I've fleshed it out a tiny bit with one of the sources that I had remaining.
[Uncle G]: That's an OCR error for [[Jharkhand]], by the way.
[Uncle G]: Use the handy tool at upper right &#x21d7; and all should become clear.  Aymatth2 forgot that [[James T. Kirk|all-important \""T.\""]].
[Uncle G]: You didn't do the first of those.
[Uncle G]: It didn't seem that you were looking for a response.  I suggested a possibility, one of two.  You gave your opinion, based upon what further work you have done, that that possibility was indeed the correct approach, and took steps.  The thing that concerns me now is a general concern that [[shilajit]] is not necessarily inclusive of all points of view, having seen some ''non''-Ayurvedic sources that are sharply at odds with the article.  Mind you, {{oldid|Shilajit|292850474|the article has been in worse condition}}. &#9786;
[Uncle G]: I think that you should have a little more courage about being right, here.  &#9786;  To split this into the Russian name and the Indian name, and have the Ayurvedic point of view in the latter and the non-Ayurvedic point of view in the former seems too much like POV forking.  Now if there were differences in the geographical origins of the twain, ''they'' might warrant a split; but, at least from what sources I've seen so far, that isn't truly the case.  Did you see anything indicating a geographic split into two distinct things?
[Uncle G]: It might be worth your dropping at note at [[Talk:Shilajit#Mumiyo deserves a separate article]].
[Uncle G]: If any lurkers reading this are interested, out of the 66 user talk pages that this message was sent to, the most active ensuring discussion is at [[User talk:DGG#Deletions of Jewish lists]].
[Uncle G]: You might like to look at [[User talk:DGG#Deletions of Jewish lists]], though.  It's not an AFD discussion.  It's simply the user talk page where Epeefleche's edit spurred the most discussion.  &#9786;
[Uncle G]: [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard\/Unsourced biographies of living persons|''Less'' contentious]]?  If you want non-contentious, I suggest [[User talk:Aymatth2#Biographies of dead headmasters|a biography of a dead headmaster]], who [[User talk:Iridescent#A Medi\xe6val deletion discussion|had nothing to do with ''Chitty Chitty Bang Bang'']].
[Uncle G]: It was {{On AFD|The Durham Proverbs}} being nominated for deletion that led to that dead headmaster.
[Uncle G]: 
[Uncle G]: It's obviously the footnote formatting that is keeping you from being magnetically drawn to [[William Horman#Further reading]]. &#9786;
[Uncle G]: Thanks to your recent edits, the magnetism is now twice as powerful.
[Uncle G]: Make that three times as powerful.
[Uncle G]: 
[Uncle G]: And I haven't even linked [[Myles Davies#References]] for you, yet.
[Uncle G]: 
[Uncle G]: I do [[Wikipedia:AfD Patrol|AFD patrol]], and I'm usually at the input end of the AFD process in doing so.  I'll happily speedily close a discussion if a speedy deletion criterion applies, or if a nomination is vandalism.  But otherwise I find that persuading people to learn better, to learn to be braver, more willing, and more inventive with the tools that they themselves possess, is a lot more productive than simply shutting down discussion by fiat.  There are of course many other reasons aside from this, and I could go on at length.  I don't have the time to do so, so I'll give just one and a half:  If it were to become the habit for administrators to shut down and speedily merge things, then people would start to rely upon administrators as article merger services.  It's happened before in the history of Wikipedia that people have felt less and less empowered to enact solutions to problems themselves, and that sort of thing is generally how it starts.  The truth is that everyone with the edit tool can do mergers, rewrites, cleanup, expansions, redirects, vandalism reversions, fact corrections, source additions, talk page cleanup, and a whole host of other ordinary editorial actions.  Administrators aren't edit-on-demand services.  Which of course means that if someone starts a discussion, and is rapidly persuaded that an ordinary editorial action will suffice without the need for an administrator to be called upon to use one of the administrator-only tools, another ordinary editor can come along and helpfully enact the consensus.  (There have been non-administrators who have helpfully enacted speedy mergers and redirects in the past.)  That has to be done with care, to avoid giving people the feeling that their toes are being trodden upon (which touches upon another reason not to be too quick to shut down discussion).  But as [[Wikipedia:Editing policy]] and [[Wikipedia:Be bold]] have for a long time pointed out, this is a wiki, and what can be done with the editing tool can be undone with the editing tool; and administrators are not funnels through which every ordinary editorial action must pass.  Furthermore, and indeed, AFD isn't \""Articles for merger\"" and it is high enough in traffic already, without passing requests that don't involve ''any'' administrator tools, including [[Wikipedia:Requested mergers]] and [[Wikipedia:Cleanup]] through it as well.  That's not a slope to start sliding down, either, and it's a bad idea to encourage people to think that they can make three edits to make an AFD nomination, and thereby hand off the burden to ''someone else'' to enact a merger (as well as add burdens to all of the people who variously patrol AFD) when the original nominator, who had the itch that needed scratching, could have enacted it xyrself in ''two edits''.
[Uncle G]: If you want to read about writing the biography of a biographer's biographer's biographer, see {{harvnb|Dunn|2000|pp=51}} who discusses that very thing.  And there are in fact already coined words for what you're discussing, which are not, in contrast to your nonce words, incorrect back formations that misconstrue \""[[wikt:bio-#English|bio-]]\"". \""[[wikt:bibiographer#English|bibiographer]]\"" is the word for a biographer of a biographer, for example, and was first used on 1973-03-30 in the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'' with reference to a life of [[Plutarch]], according to {{harvnb|Winslow|1980|pp=4}}.
[Uncle G]: I'm way ahead of you, not least because I saw the kerfuffle about this on the Village Pump.  Edokter {{diff|Template:Reflist\/doc|396131163|396123934|switched the template over}} for a while so that it always did this (for numbers greater than 1).  It's reversed again, now.
[Uncle G]: I suggest that you go and read it, then, since you've clearly missed an important part of it.  [[Wikipedia:Refactoring talk pages|Refactoring discussions]] is a practice of such long standing that it goes all of the way back to WikiWikiWeb.  After you've read the very page that you're waving around, go and familiarize yourself with the [[Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons]] policy.
[Uncle G]: No worries.  It is, alas, something that has to be done on rare occasion at AFD.
[Uncle G]: All that I did was simple deletion sorting.  It wasn't anything to do with the article itself or the outcome of the AFD discussion.<p>The ''Irish Times'' {{plainlink|1=http:\/\/irishtimes.com.\/search\/library\/index.html?rm=listresults&keywords={{urlencode:\""Fintan Connolly\""}}|2=is searchable}}.
[Uncle G]: We've ''just had'' an AFD discussion go through Deletion Review because \""oppose\"" is ambiguous and unclear.  One could be opposed to all sorts of things, from the nomination through the existence of the article to the statement of the immediately preceding participant.  This ambiguity comes up from time to time over the years, and it's best to nip it in the bud.
[Uncle G]: If you look [[#Thanks|down &dArr;]] you might be able to help someone else with [[Fintan Connolly]].
[Uncle G]: If you are tired of dead chemists, try a dead lawyer.  Notice the [[Henry Clay Whitney]] link hiding in {{On AFD|John Hanks}}.  {{harvnb|Neely|1982|pp=335}} and {{harvnb|Lossing|Wilson|1905|pp=352}} are fairly persuasive that he is encyclopaedic.
[Uncle G]: No, it doesn't.  Look carefully at the diffs and at the timing of the edits relative to the CCI discussion.
[Uncle G]: That material could possibly have come from another part of the book.  Other entries in it cross-reference that one, I notice.  The article's creator is the person to consult on that.  I just cross-linked for the part of the book that I read.  Talking of creators:  You might like to see who the creator of [[Template:cn-span]] was.  &#9786;
[Uncle G]: Not apart from just using it in everyday editing, no.  It wasn't my idea, by the way.
[Uncle G]: It's simpler than that.  The notices said that the discussion has been deletion sorted into various bins.  Those notices were erroneous.  The article wasn't deletion sorted into ''any'' bins at the time of the notice removal.  I left the notice on for the bin that ''I'' was sorting into in another tab.  Gene93k has just applied notices for the bins that xe has &mdash; now &mdash; sorted into.
[Uncle G]: Don't add the notices if you haven't done (and aren't immediately going to do) the sorting work.  Think about it.  Would the discussion actually get deletion sorted that way?
[Uncle G]: The explanation was already given at length in the AFD discussion and on Commons.  I'm not going to re-type it all again here.
[Uncle G]: You just need to look at the creator's contributions on Commons.  That's what I did.  It's a global account.
[Uncle G]: There's nothing wrong to be fixed.  It's a link to an anchor on the same page, and ''does'' link to the citation.  Following it will cause the page to be scrolled to the actual citation for Widner1998, in the reference bibliography, which will (in many WWW browsers) be highlighted.  See [[Wikipedia:Citing sources\/Further considerations#Wikilinks to full references]] for more.
[Uncle G]: They were falsehoods.  They stated that the discussion had been deletion sorted.  It hadn't been.  Don't apply the notices unless you've actually done the sorting work that you are stating has been done.
[Uncle G]: One cannot get much more serious and further away from the fringe of human thought than ''Big Brother'', ne?<p>Now you can tell me what the proper name of {{On AFD|Wisdom Christianity|Wisdom Christianity (2nd nomination)}} is.  It's probably in one of the several books cited at the bottom of the article.<p>
[Uncle G]: It anything it is you should be apologising for wasting everyone's time and trying to beat other editors into doing work that you want done, and can do yourself, with repeated AFD nominations where you do none of the work yourself.  There's nothing rude in pointing out that that's exactly what you're doing, and your trying to portray yourself as the victim when someone else (administrator or no) points out your fault is actually what is unacceptable.  You are not the victim.  You are someone who is doing nothing yourself whilst berating others about the fact that after a mere three days something that you wanted done, agreed should be done, and even had the tools to do, wasn't done; and abusing AFD as a big hammer.  ''You are the problem''.
[Uncle G]: Untrue.  You're the one waving your editing abilities around, remember.  No-one else even brought them up.  I'm the one asking you why you didn't ''use the tools that you have'' rather than do nothing at all except renominate a page for deletion again and again.  I've asked you three times, now, and here you are trying to play the victim again, rather than answering the very simple and straightforward question of why on Earth you didn't pick up your tools and ''do''.  Stop putting up this smokescreen.  You didn't do what you yourself wanted to do, agreed to do, and could do; but just tried to abuse AFD to hammer other people into doing for you.  Because of that ''you're the problem''.  Indeed, you're the very problem that you're complaining about.  As I've already said, {{tl|sofixit}} applies.
[Uncle G]: Nonsense.  That's not bringing up your editing abilities.  It is, however, asking you if nominating the page for deletion is the only thing that you do.  I could have indeed, just observed outright that the evidence is that this ''is'' the only thing that you do, with a page that you think should be ''renamed and rewritten'' (which is ''cleanup not deletion'').  It's the only thing that you've ''done''.  You've done nothing at all &mdash; no article edits rewriting what you say should be rewritten, no use of the rename tool to rename what you think should be renamed &mdash; to fix the problem that you knew how to fix, wanted fixed, and had the tools to fix.  You ''are'' doing one thing over and over here, and your only way of dealing with an article that you ''keep saying'' should be cleaned up, with renaming and rewriting, ''is'' not to actually clean it up, but nominate it for deletion again and again.  And you complain that no-one else did your bidding after a mere three days, on top of that.  You are the very problem that you complain of.  (That's not a personal attack, either, unless ''your making the complaint about people not renaming the article for you is also a personal attack on everyone else''.  You're hiding behind that \""I'm attacked.\"" smokescreen again.  Stop that silliness.)  You've failed again and again to explain why you keep saying \""it needs a rewrite and a rename\"" and why on Earth ''you did not just rewrite and rename'', then, but came to AFD demanding that since neither anyone else ''nor you'' had done this you were going to expend loads of edits (It's somewhere in the 10s, now.) on another AFD nomination instead.  You've not even explained that ''once'', let alone four times.  Now stop hiding behind smokescreens with silliness about nonexistent personal attacks.  That's dodging the question, not answering it.
[Uncle G]: That's the sad thing.  They ''already have'' provided it to people such as me who've looked at your edits to that article.  You did nothing.  No rewrites.  No renames.  Two AFD nominations, taking far more edits to do than rewriting and renaming would have taken.  It's entirely unimpressive.  But yet less impressive still is your response to being asked why you did nothing except nominate for deletion again and again, which is to dodge the question again and again in various ways, laughably try to claim that it's an attack even to be simply asked why you did nothing when you could have ''just done'' what you wanted, and (quite ironically) make personal attacks, yet more of which (alongside yet another failure to answer why on Earth you don't use your own edit and rename tools to do rewrites and renames that you want done, but try to beat other editors into doing the work for you with repeat AFD nominations after a mere three days) I note in the above.<p>Do nothing.  Demand that everyone else do something for you.  Abuse AFD.  Argue and dodge incessantly the question of why you don't pull the tools out and ''just do'' renaming and rewriting in a case where you keep saying an article \""needs a rewrite and a rename\"".  Your edit history shows it all, alas.
[Uncle G]: And now we see a distraction fallacy.  Two, in fact.  Still no answer to the question of why you don't use your own tools and want everyone else to do the work for you, and will happily abuse AFD to that end, though.
[Uncle G]: When someone puts forward rubbish like that, one tells them that it's rubbish.  And it is.  Should we not go around saying that something is wrong when it is wrong?  Don't be silly.  Disagreeing with things that are wrong is not aggression.  However, claiming \""I'm attacked.\"" and \""You're drunk.\"" and so forth are bad ways of replying to simple questions and making one's argument, and quite transparently so.  As is, too, riding the coat-tails of a bad argument in order to decry the fact that one was told that one should actually check things out, and put content and deletion policy into action as they are intended to be put.
[Uncle G]: It's a laudable goal, but the copyright licences simply don't permit it.  That's frustrating to people at times, but the simple maxim to remember is this: If one wants to copy and use content elsewhere, one may not have it and its supporting edit history deleted.  One has to pick either copying, using, and ''keeping'' the edit history, or deleting, losing, and ''not using'' the content anywhere.<p>Personally, I thought that it was a poor article at a bad title (Subject names are generally not adjectives.), whose content is probably wrong anyway.  (I just, as a result of the AFD discussion at {{On AFD|CSI (pinball)}}, came across discussion in a book of ''termination conditions'' and ''victory states'' in games, and I suspect from that and other reading that the bad names and poor explanations that we have aren't supported in the actual literature on the subject at all, and that the encyclopaedia isn't doing a very good job of passing along the ''actual'' knowledge of the subject to those who don't know it.)  The comments by Niz and others in the history of [[Talk:Unwinnable]] tend to bear that out.
[Uncle G]: When something is rubbish, it's rubbish.  And silliness about not saying that something is wrong when it is wrong, somehow because of \""caring\"" (which is in reality completely unrelated to the issue), is just absurd.  Read the absurd argument that you're making here.  Try thinking about what ''you'' would think if someone told you not to tell xem that xe was wrong and tried to make out that it was because you didn't care about xem.  That's absurd and transparent manipulation, not to say a foolish over-relativistic argument that the erroneous should be given equal validity to the correct because it's better to pander to manipulative \""Don't you care about me?\"" arguments  than it is to be concerned with doing things correctly and to the benefit of the encyclopaedia and to point out when things are being done wrongly (Fly by Night) and to ask for explanations when something is wholly unexplained (you).  You should ''know'' that that's daft.  Think!
[Uncle G]: [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard\/Archive215#rangeblock of 96.231.x.x]] provides some background.
[Uncle G]: I apologize for not paying close attention.  I was distracted.
[Uncle G]: I thought that you might have Vernes in the pipeline, from reading the sources.  I recommend against even thinking of people as \""-istas\"" of any stripe.  The \""-istas\"" were bad ideas from the start.  Anyway, we don't cite sources for people who choose to foolishly polarize over a mechanism of the tool that we happen to use to write the encyclopaedia.  We cite them for readers to follow up on and for fellow editors to employ. Are you looking for something like {{diff|Jacob_Vernet|407936002|407911644|this}}?  There are alternative ways of doing the same thing, including specifying the chapter and page number with the <code>loc=<\/code> parameter to {{tl|sfn}}.
[Uncle G]: Yes, the \""You dirty [[wikt:-ista#English|-ista]]s!\"".  They've only ever been used to call other people names, and their use has never improved a discussion.<p>So, you got Vernes and Vernet mixed up when reading the books, eh?  &#9786;  Did you notice the ''dictionnaires'' of biography in [[Antoine-Jacques Roustan#References]]?  I wouldn't be surprised if there's a whole WikiProject, akin to [[Project:WikiProject Dictionary of National Biography]], there that Anglophone bias causes people to ignore.  I didn't look too hard, but I have my suspicion that [[Marc-Michel Rey]], Amsterdam bookseller and Roustan's publisher, is encyclopaedic.   Apparently [[Honor\xe9 Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau]] did some work for him in 1776&ndash;1777.<p>
[Uncle G]: I'm surprised that we didn't have an encyclop\xe9diste.  I'm not surprised that parallels can be drawn.  See the debates on the subject of biographical articles, for example.  Or [[Leslie Stephen]] on the subject of notability when discussing the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]''.  Indeed, see how ''long'' it takes to write an encyclopaedia.  If you want someone else to write about:<p>Did you know &hellip; that [[Johann Heinrich Zedler]] was the first encyclopaedist to include biographies of living persons, and didn't just use bare URLs as his source citations {{harv|Collison|1966|pp=105}}?<p>
[Uncle G]: Your bigger problem is {{tl|Zedler Online}}.  Our version doesn't have many of the mechanisms that the German Wikipedia's one does.  But since it isn't transcluded to the extent that the German Wikipedia's one is, it might, in contrast, be easier to update.  Wikisource has a copy of the text at [[s:de:Zedler:Zedler, (Johann Heinrich)]] and for now you can probably get by with linking to that manually, specifying the numbers explicitly, and simply not using that template in the footnote at all.
[Uncle G]: You didn't notice {{diff|Johann Heinrich Zedler|409093569|409089365|my subtle and unremarked interspersal between your edits}}?  And there I was doing you a favour by using ''no words at all'' &hellip;
[Uncle G]: Actually it's [[philosophy of art]], ironically one of the areas where Wikipedia is traditionally said to be weak even though philosophy articles were amongst our very first edits.
[Uncle G]: Better?  Irritating conflicts?  I am, as alluded, simply very busy elsewhere.
[Uncle G]: I was very busy ''before'' it came up, which is why {{diff|Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Philosophy|prev|409973806|I said that I didn't have the time}}.  If anything, I'm even busier now than I was then.  I shouldn't really be spending the time doing even this.  &#9786;"
Guroadrunner,False,"[Guroadrunner]: If we come to the conclusion of using \""that\"", I would be more than willing to change them all manually (you don't need that work dumped on you), but I would need to know how far back the templates go chronologically.
[Guroadrunner]: I will make the changes sometime in the next 48 hours then. Good to see another avid fan doing a lot of work on improving F1 here (I respect your opinion on all things F1-related).
[Guroadrunner]: Thank you again and here's hoping Thunder Valley gives us a good race tonight!

[Guroadrunner]: However, I do believe that the above three edits bolded violate 3RR because it is within a 24h span. It seems like getting the image off that Jorts page became an edit war not necessarily of your doing. --
[Guroadrunner]: Congratulations on the successful RFA!
[Guroadrunner]: Please respond on my talk page if you disagree, and why.
[Guroadrunner]: Dude. Talk to me instead of just reverting.
[Guroadrunner]: The article plagiarizes from a single source, by using so much of that source. It needs multiple sources to not be plagiarism.
[Guroadrunner]: Thanks for fixing [[History of Warsaw]]. :-)
[Guroadrunner]: DH, Thanks for the heads up! - I have never used AWB before, but I just downloaded it per your suggestion. I will have to figure out how to make it work this weekend because I'd really like to have all of the article assessed (pet project).
[Guroadrunner]: This -- [[:Image:Ferrari F2005 front suspension.jpg]] -- is one of the most beautiful pictures I've seen in a long time. Hope you had a good trip to Japan.
[Guroadrunner]: Could a AWB run do this ? (Does DH have AWB ?)
[Guroadrunner]: While I never understood how to get AWB to make edits, shortly after having AWB I received the same problem that I needed an update, but the program would not do so. I can emphathize.
[Guroadrunner]: Can't say. It was at a friend's house.
[Guroadrunner]: I agree. Kill it. I think I edited that article as part of wikifying articles. --
[Guroadrunner]: Note to self: This is OK - it was converted from JPG to PNG. --
[Guroadrunner]: Looking at the article's history, you both clearly did a lot of work on today's featured article. Congratulations on making front page! --"

Colin,False,"[Colin]: Like Mariel, I am unable to have any medically informed opinion on this matter. I respect your conclusion but that's [[WP:OR|original research]] unless you can find a good reference to back it up.--
[Colin]: Alternatively, do you think it would be useful for the anticonvulsant article to have a section on drugs \""Under Investigation\""? This would naturally be somewhat fluid when drugs either end up getting licensed or forgotten (no research in the last 5 years, say). --
[Colin]: Done --
[Colin]: There are obviously better tools and more qualified folk to do this. But I think a simple diagram is better than no diagram, provided it is correct. You can see a list of the ones I've done on my user page. BTW: I add the diagram to Wikimedia Commons, which magically gets picked up by Wikipedia. If you don't want to draw them yourself, let me know which ones you want images for --
[Colin]: I didn't feel bold enough to make the edits. I should have made some, but quite a few were posted for discussion. I'm no medic and haven't been involved in enough \""medical condition\"" articles to feel that I could impose my POV. Writing medical articles for Wikipedia is a challenge - the audience is so varied. Cheers,
[Colin]: I've responded on your talk page and on [[Talk:Epilepsy]].
[Colin]: Hi. Happy New Year to you. I'd really like a nice picture of Sirolimus (Rapamycin), which is a promising research drug for [[tuberous sclerosis]]. Any chance you could do a pretty picture? The existing one is a GIF. Looking on PubChem shows lots of variants. Clearly the drug forms a big loop, but some drawings are angular and some are perfectly round. Why? There is a 3D aspect to the drug, but perhaps a 3D ball picture would be messy as it is a big drug. Cheers,
[Colin]: Thanks for the quick reply. No rush. Your examples look lovely.
[Colin]: Many thanks for the new images. In addition to the [[sirolimus]] article, I've added the 3D model to the brand new [[timeline of tuberous sclerosis]].
[Colin]: Hey. I've just noticed your [[Mammalian target of rapamycin|mTOR]] picture. That's a real work of modern art! Is molecular biology your field? Would you be able to help with (at least some of) the Pathophysiology section in [[Tuberous sclerosis]]? I could direct you to some of the recent reviews\/papers. This is an area where lots of exciting work is being done but it is way beyond my understanding. That article still needs a whole lot of work, and I can't do it all. If I can help with any of your articles (in a lay capacity) let me know. Cheers,
[Colin]: That's good advice, I'll look at that project tomorrow and post a request. If you still fancy working on that article, let me know what would interest you and I'll try to help find the relevant sources. I'll understand if you want to wait and see if I get help from the experts.
[Colin]: I came here today to say the same thing. Best wishes,
[Colin]: I'm very encouraged by the changes both of you are making. Please don't stop. As a lay reader, I feel that I'm being guided through a difficult topic rather than just given an (accurate) map and expected to make my own way. BTW: There is a typo in the Genetics section, 2nd paragraph: \""Coeliac disease is |linked]] to two alleles of the .\"" --
[Colin]: It was a pleasure. Thanks for fixing my howler of a typo. I've tweaked the coealiac section a little since. I moved the historical perspective\/analysis to a new paragraph and tried to make the section make more sense by itself. Can you check this over and see if this has been achieved? I noticed your goof on [[Samuel Jones Gee]], which made me laugh.
[Colin]: Ah, I think it needs a sentence or two of Gee's description of the disease & symptoms. I'll write something this evening, unless you beat me to it...
[Colin]: re: Gee's photo. What makes you think it is copyright? I suspect, that like most of the other portraits, its copyright status is unknown. We don't know the artist so can only guess he probably died over 70 years ago. We can speculate it was published prior to 1909, which makes the original public domain in the US (though if published after his death in 1911 it is more complex - I think published in the US prior to 1923 is another cut-off. Why so complicated, I truly don't follow it all) And we trust WP is protected by the Bridgeman Art Library v. Corel Corp. ruling on \""slavish reproductions\"" of public domain works in the US. To complicate things, I'm in the UK, as is the BMJ, the Royal College of Physicians, and the copyright situation here is, shall we say, untested. However, PubMed Central is in the US as I assume are you, both of which help. Do you want to take a gamble? What's the worse that can happen? I can show you how to extract the original JPG from the PDF, which is better quality (but sadly not brilliant).
[Colin]: It is possible for a publication to get (for free\/cheaply) the permission to use a pic for limited purposes \u2013 so why bother with any risky fair-use or Bridgeman\/Corel gambles. To pop something on Commons is much more difficult and they wouldn't accept Fair Use (it would have to go on en-WP). As you say, worse that can happen is it gets deleted\/moved to en-WP. I've always been honest about any ignorance in the info I post on commons so other folk can decide if they don't want to host it. You probably know more about the copyright law than I do, since I've only picked up stuff from WP. Let me know if you want to do the upload and I'll send you some details. Otherwise, I'll think about it. Time for bed...
[Colin]: BTW: I've shamelessly stolen your Commons gallery user page. Of course, yours is prettier.
[Colin]: Fvasconcellos, I wonder if you'd look at [[Christian Archibald Herter (physician)]] and tweak as required. Thanks.
[Colin]: I should probably study [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Biography|WikiProject Biography]] for guidelines...
[Colin]: Congratulations. Clearly a lot of work went into that article. Well done.
[Colin]: I agree. I note that this template isn't in a category, or mentioned on any Wikipedia\/Project page. I'd like to add it to the \""Navigation templates\"" section in [[WP:MEDMOS]] but it would be good link to a list of medical navigation templates.
[Colin]: Are there any more, suitable for the Medicine project?
[Colin]: Yes, but there's no point in both of us asking for the same papers. I thought you might have some already. I'll draw up a list.
[Colin]: [[User:Ccroberts|Ccroberts]] has mentioned on [[Talk:Melatonin]] that the 3D structural image may be wrong. I wondered if you could investigate. Cheers,
[Colin]: My only suggestion at this stage is to request a pause in the discussion at [[Talk:Tourette syndrome]] until Sandy gets back.  If that doesn't work, perhaps Tim can find a compromise that will do for now? Don't overestimate my knowledge of \""TS research\"". I've read a textbook, the WP articles and a few papers! My understanding of prevalence\/incidence is only what I've learned in order to contribute to my own neglected [[tuberous sclerosis|pet subject (TSC)]]. I'm fortunate TSC is genetic with a stable diagnosis that isn't subject to the whim of the DSM (a recent New Scientist [http:\/\/www.newscientist.com\/channel\/health\/mg19426043.900-bipolar-children--is-the-us-overdiagnosing.html article] and [http:\/\/www.newscientist.com\/channel\/opinion\/mg19426042.900-editorial-mania-for-treatment.html editorial] on bipolar diagnosis in children caught my attention). I appreciate the politics and possible agenda issues. For now, it looks like a fairly healthy fact-based discussion. I'll keep an eye on it
[Colin]: I've done some searching and have come up with a big pile of names all with Wikipedia articles that mention having polio. It will take me ages to go through them and I'm a bit worn out and can't face doing them all on my own. I think this list could definitely be an FL. The only thing holding it back is ensuring it is comprehensive. Would you guys be interested in helping? If so, I can post the list on the talk page along with some hints 'n' tips for searching for sources.
[Colin]: The hints 'n' tips essay is [[User:Colin\/Medical lists of people|here]].
[Colin]: Thanks for your support. I'll have another look for Judith E. Heumann photos, but that was the best I could find at the time, that I was reasonably sure was OK to copy. BTW: Do you know David Onley's date of birth? I hope that with all the publicity, we'll be able to improve the information in the list and also in his own article. Cheers,
[Colin]: Thanks for your support. I'll have another look for Judith E. Heumann photos, but that was the best I could find at the time, that I was reasonably sure was OK to copy. BTW: Do you know David Onley's date of birth? I hope that with all the publicity, we'll be able to improve the information in the list and also in his own article. Cheers,
[Colin]: Sure, if it is no trouble. It has a transparent background that I suspect you'll need to change to white as I don't think JPG has transparencies. Cheers,
[Colin]: Sure, if it is no trouble. It has a transparent background that I suspect you'll need to change to white as I don't think JPG has transparencies. Cheers,
[Colin]: I can't see any need for transparency for my purpose. Whatever is smaller and looks OK I suppose.
[Colin]: I see that your [[The Age of Reason]] is currently sitting unloved at peer review. Looking very briefly at it, I see a level of writing skill well above mine. I'd only be able to give a general opinion really, and one from someone unfamiliar with both the topic and the kind of way it is handled on WP. If I get some time, I'll read it through. I've got the rest of that Autism article to review too...
[Colin]: BTW: I posted a similar request to prose guru [[User:Tony1|Tony]], but I think he was [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:SandyGeorgia&diff=prev&oldid=144940394 tripping on magic mushrooms last night] :-).
[Colin]: Thanks for your comments and for tweaking the lead. Cheers,
[Colin]: I was only planning to change the tense in a few locations, nothing major. I'm too tired to give it a decent go tonight. I'll look at your other suggestions tomorrow as well. [[List of human genes]] doesn't seem to be worth linking to IMO. I'd rather work with someone to create short hamartin\/tuberin articles. I could create a stub and then seek out some help.
[Colin]: I've looked at creating articles for the proteins\/genes and have decided to ask for help before creation. I'm not sure whether to pick the gene or the protein. I've replaced the OMIM template with a full web citation template. The mid-20th century is a bonus chapter ;-). I'm not sure of the best way to split the sections (see the talk page). If there were short phrases for \""first half of the 20th century\""; \""second half of the 20th century\"" then I'd go for that.
[Colin]: Good luck with the remaining time for your nomination. BTW: under what section on [[Wikipedia:Featured lists]] do you think it should appear?
[Colin]: Cheers,
[Colin]: Wrt the section above: I have some friends in the MOS-police, you know :-). It is certainly best if we can find ways of accommodating each other's wishes without coming to blows. Your partnership idea sounds good. You are certainly right that I have no humanities background. Indeed, on the subjects I edit on WP, I'm little more than an interested amateur. I'm increasingly reminded, as I bump into other editors or read other articles, how primitive an editor I am.
[Colin]: (copied from [[User talk:TonyTheTiger]]) I've moved the Survey\/Discussion to the talk page. I think the main page should focus on the proposed procedure rather than become a discussion page itself. Can I suggest that IMO it is way too early to call a survey (support\/oppose). I recommend you remove that section ASAP. This will free the discussion from becoming polarised. When it appears the proposal is heading somewhere positive, then call a survey to gauge the opinion.
[Colin]: [[User:DO11.10]] and [[User:MarcoTolo]] have been working on [[poliomyelitis]] for some time and DO11.10 is close to nominating at FAC. I'm partway through reviewing and copyediting but I'm not good enough to get it up to FAC quality. I'd really appreciate it if you could help to ensure it is well prepared for FAC. Be bold with your edits, or make some comments on the talk page. Regards,
[Colin]: What do I know about poliomyelitis other than what I've read in the excellent set of articles on WP? I think some more copyediting and lay-reader-friendly prose is required. Even just pointing out the hard\/awkward bits will help. Cheers,
[Colin]: Thanks for your edits and suggestions; they really helped.
[Colin]: Two other difficulties are that I'm based in the UK, so we have timezone issues, and I don't have nearly as much time to spend on-wiki as you do. Are you happy to work at a gentle pace? I'm sure you've got plenty other things to multitask, including that important dissertation. Cheers,
[Colin]: [http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/radio4\/history\/inourtime\/inourtime_20071115.shtml BBC Radio 4: In Our Time 15 November] may interest you and your wikifriends. A panel of three experts discuss Priestley, Lavoisier and events of the time. You can listen online with RealPlayer. I wonder what you make of it.
[Colin]: Don't you wish there was a way to fix edit summaries? Truly embarrassing to have spelling errors in a copyedit edit summary. It is like writing a great letter to your girlfriend and then misspelling her name on the envelope.
[Colin]: [but in] btw: there are bits of this discussion on [[User talk:Colin]] and [[User talk:Rmky87]].
[Colin]: I'd support the suggested change, which is minor. I think \""superficial\"" differences refers to the ease with which a ''reader'' can cope with another variety. Changing writing habits is much harder, if not impossible.
[Colin]: Well I suspect they are wrong. The word \""superficial\"" was introduced during [[User:Tony1|Tony]]'s redraft that was incorporated [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AManual_of_Style&diff=137355151&oldid=137298931 here]. Around that time [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style\/Archive_85 he said] \""the differences are superficial for readers, who can, by and large, easily recognise the odd word\/spelling from another variety; they're a little harder for writers, but that's not what matters. Tony 06:55, 5 July 2007 (UTC)\"". Of course, making life harder for writers does matter. Still, if there is no appetite for a fight, why go to war?
[Colin]: [[WP:NOT|Wikipedia does not]] carry advertising. This is a drug with a very limited licence. The number of physicians and pharmacies needing to obtain this drug is extremely limited, and I suspect they have better sources of information than an international encyclopaedia.
[Colin]: I'm relieved that Awadewit has declined. Wikipedia needs admins who are active with the mop, which is inevitably a distraction from content production. Awadewit is one of our best content producers; it would be a shame to diminish that activity. I suspect Awadewit's watchlist is more genteel than most of Wikipedia, and has less need for vandal fighting and protection.
[Colin]: There was no [[Help:Edit summary|Edit summary]] for your edit, and I incorrectly assumed it was nonsense. I see now that this is an abbreviation for the Butalbital-Aspirin-Caffeine formulation, not the Butalbital-Acetaminophen-Caffeine formulation you had appended it to. As you say, this is a generic term, so it doesn't fit with a list of \""trade names\"". I'm not inclined to pollute articles with all the permutations of abbreviations that may be in use. If you disagree, post a request at [[WT:PHARM]].
[Colin]: Looking at the discussion on [[Talk:Introduction to virus]], there appears to be at technical reason behind the request. This can be solved. Lots of similar templates take optional parameters that let you vary the text\/links. You can make a request on the template talk page.
[Colin]: Please share your UK experience.
[Colin]: Oh, I was hoping SVG would retain the font info so the hinting mechanism would kick in at tiny font sizes. But it would seem that outlines don't shrink much better than raster at 400px. Sorry for the trouble caused for so little difference!
[Colin]: I haven't addressed all your and Graham's concerns, and I intend to. I've still more material to read and consider for inclusion, plus I want to take some better pictures.  I thought that once I'm happy with its comprehensiveness, I'd go for peer review (with adverts). I also plan to ask one or two of our literary writers to look over the prose -- but don't want to polish too early. I might even try to get an expert review. So much to do and so little time. FAC is a wee while away yet.
[Colin]: 
[Colin]: I think we need to discuss this area before performing more moves.
[Colin]: If any of this looks contentious then I'd like to get the nod from WP:MED.
[Colin]: Hmm. I think I agree with you. If 99% of the use of [[seizure]] on WP is the epileptic kind then really [[seizure]] should either ''be'' or redirect ''to'' the epileptic article. I think changing [[seizure]] to a redirect and having the article sit at [[epileptic seizure]] is an improvement on pre-June 2 since the article then has its full unambiguous medical title. And then its hatnote can say \""''Seizure redirects here, for other uses see seizure (disambiguation)''\"" This version also saves a lot of work fixing links. I'll post a note at WP:MED.
[Colin]: Hi, Fvasconcellos. Just caught your message as I logged on. I've not been on WP much recently. Don't see the point in relisting. Nobody's interested. I've asked Tatterfly for input but he's ignored that and seems to be slowly adding [[seizure (medicine)]] to links that clearly should be linking to epileptic seizures. That's a backward step. Let's do what we discussed wrt redirects and reverts. I can patch up any hatnotes and other non-admin things. If you're not clear on what we'd settled on, let me know. Off to bed now...
[Colin]: The word \""seizure\"" isn't unique to medicine and the medical meaning is probably #2 in most dictionaries. But we are fortunate that the other meanings, although common, don't warrant an article in an encyclopaedia. The full medical term \""epileptic seizure\"", as defined by the ILAE, is what I'd name the article if writing something stand-alone. But the \""easy and second nature\"" linking guideline moves things towards the informal shorter \""seizure\"". Let's go back to [[seizure]], then, but I'll rewrite the lead to say \""A '''epileptic seizure''' is a...\"", and work on an appropriate hatnote.
[Colin]: If you still think there's a problem, you could try [[WT:MED]] but I didn't get much response when I asked last time.
[Colin]: Since the GA nom is still recent, let's see if I can get some fresh eyes and a hard time from someone new. I can ask you any time (and will do) and your opinion is more valuable to me than a little green badge. If nobody reviews it, then I'd be delighted if you cast a critical eye over it. Similarly, if you want to help edit (e.g., on the Mechanism section for which I have plenty sources but are mostly a bit beyond my understanding) then that shouldn't preclude you participating at FAC provide we're open about any contribution. Cheers,
[Colin]: Many thanks, Tim, for your review and tweaks\/additions. I'll start working through the points later this evening.
[Colin]: I think I've addressed most of your specific points. The more general improvements to the prose will take me a little longer.
[Colin]: I am disappointed you see nothing wrong with that edit. It is just the sort of misuse of primary sources that WP:MEDRS aims to avoid.
[Colin]: No, you are not merely a messenger passing on someone else's authoratative advice. Look at what you wrote: \""I'm left with suspicions of bias\"", \""I don't think we should\"", \""We can't be making these assumptions\"", \""Earlier I pointed out that this review [12] was biased\"", \""I doubt that this biased\"", \""it seems to me a \""redflag\"" for bias\"", \""you should be using\"". It is abundantly clear that you are giving your own personal opinion, and are not presenting it in any humble way. You are writing as though ''your'' advice is worth considering and yet your actions (such as the diff) make it abundantly clear that you either don't understand or choose not to follow the existing advice in MEDRS, or indeed [[WP:V]]. One has to wonder what exactly you are trying to achieve with the drawn-out discussion. Are you seeking advice or giving it?
[Colin]: Where did Eubulides' draft ever say \""assume that primary studies not mentioned in a particular review have methodological problems\"". I can't find it in the diffs. He does (and still does) say that such primary studies are dubious, which simply means they are \""of uncertain quality, intention, or appropriateness\"" (Encarta dictionary) -- it doesn't mean they ''are'' bad. Can you supply the diff where the draft said that?
[Colin]: The purpose of scholarly citations and the purpose of citations on Wikipedia are completely different. In the first, you have one expert communicating with another expert, indicating the root source of the information, and giving credit for its discovery where appropriate. Citing a review might well indicate laziness on the part of the scholar, but there are other reasons such as where (as you indicate) the review adds value or where the primary material is in a foreign language or otherwise inaccessible. On Wikipedia, we have the unique problem (not shared by other encyclopaedias, who generally don't cite their sources) where the authors are not regarded as experts. Even if some authors are experts, we have no way of proving this and so cannot rely on the authority of the author. By citing a review, one is saying \""Look, an expert has reviewed the subject and agrees with what the WP article says.\"" Even a poor review is a step above \""A Wikipedian has reviewed the subject and thinks we should say X\"" as Wikipedians should have no voice at all. The review ''does'' add value: it adds the weight of an expert opinion.
[Colin]: I going on break now. Please read [[Wikipedia:No_original_research#Primary.2C_secondary.2C_and_tertiary_sources]]. Particularly \""Wikipedia articles should rely on reliable, published secondary sources.\"" Note the full stop at the end of that sentence. There's not \""but\"" or \""except\"". Reliable primary sources can be used \""but only with care\"". Part of what [[WP:MEDRS]] emphasises is the sort of care and dangers there are using them in medical articles. As for the the \""expert\"" problem on Wikipedia, it is fundamental to why we have the three core policies.  If you want a wiki written by experts, try Citizendium.
[Colin]: Thanks, Fvasconcellos. I've changed over to it. I don't have a strong opinion on the font other than it should be clear.
[Colin]: I agree that the list isn't long enough for FL, especially when you consider it affects so many people. Possibly, the only way to satisfy the \""Comprehensive\"" requirement is to clarify that it includes only people whose Hep C status is on public record (rather than merely \""known\""). I haven't spent anything like the time on this list as I did on the other FLs. The polio list was a good collaboration: we created a list of candidates on the talk page based on unreliable sources\/searches (IMDB, Wikipedia, other lists) and then worked through them finding reliable sources. Don't restrict yourself to Google searches: try Google Books and the online newspapers' own search tools. If the list is to grow, then a split into occupations would be useful. Up to you if you want to do it now and be prepared to revise the groupings as it grows.
[Colin]: Sorry for the delay. I've not been on WP for a week. The changes are good. I've revised the lead a little. You'll need to make sure it is reliably sourced with citations for each fact. There are three names that are either unlinked or redlinked. You'll need to create articles\/stubs for those or else drop them as non-notable. I think the Kansas City Star external link probably fails our [[WP:EL]] policy as it doesn't add anything a featured article would contain, and isn't as accurate as this one. Keep looking for reliably sourced entries as the biggest problem I think you'll have at FL is the perception that it isn't comprehensive. I'm afraid I just don't have any significant time for WP at the moment.
[Colin]: As one of Wikipedia's least prolific editors, DYK wasn't a game I thought I could play. Looks like the body text (two paragraphs) is just shy of the 1500 characters needed. Hmm, maybe it will grow a little.
[Colin]: That last point is important. Adding WP:MEDRS to the list of guidelines guarantees more critical eyes will look and comment. It moves from being somewhat under control of one project, to being edited by the wider community.
[Colin]: I replaced it with FDR, who I've submitted as an alternative hook on the DKY nomination. I ''really'' don't want the article to become a list of retrospective diagnoses, as it would be hundreds of entries long. I'd prefer to replace the examples list with prose and give some more general comment on some of the better RDs -- as currently the article is a bit unbalanced.
[Colin]: Sorry, you've lost me there. Where are the \""digs\""? I must admit I'm finding the DYK a bit confusing. Three comments by three editors and no follow-up. I suppose it is a \""lite\"" process rather than a discussion.  Perhaps it isn't fascinating enough? I remember finding that FDR article and reading the paper and thinking it was a great story.
[Colin]: I struck through the original nom when I offered an alternative as reviewers will still looking just at the original. The original was deemed too long and (I think) a reviewer had an issue with us saying \""is regarded by some medical historians\"" but only citing one. I couldn't figure out how to use the quote in a short DKY and remain accurate. I thought my alternative was interesting and 100% sourced but Una has some problems with it that I just can't understand. Certainly the lack of any interaction with reviewers at DKY makes it hard to respond and ask questions.
[Colin]: I think I'll have to decline.  I'm sure I wrote something briefly before, which got replaced and I'm fine about it. The whole issue got people wound up that their FA would be demoted to an FL and I'm not sure there was any consensus resolution. I'd rather read a dispatch that was upbeat than about disputed areas.
[Colin]: You know, a DYK is < 200 characters and generated ''this'' much response. I wonder if that text:discussion ratio beats Ottava's FAC? :-)
[Colin]: Your response to Paul's accusations, on that talk page, only invites further personal comments on that page. We need to focus editors back to discussing the text of the guideline, rather than procedural or behavioural issues that just lead to heat and no progress.
[Colin]: What an amazing conversation you guys are having over on SG's talk page. Feel quite out of my depth, which is why I'm asking you to look at something for me. One of our policy pages is discussing the addition of a section \""No original logic\"". See [[WT:NOR#Proposed New Section : No Original Logic]], [[WT:NOR#No Original Logic Leads into SYNTH]] and [[WT:NOR#Logic]]. I've commented but might as well be talking to myself. Perhaps I'm totally misunderstanding the point being made. Any Awadewit-talk-page-lurkers are invited too. Cheers,
[Colin]: It isn't my own personal opinion but you are right that the source wasn't sufficient. This was an oversight as there are a few sources in the article that would supply the necessary support. I've updated the article and responded on the talk page.
[Colin]: Don't \""bow out\"". It's clear both you and Cas have wound each other up and are getting annoyed. Try to consider how much pressure Cas will be feeling, as FAC is a stressful place to be. But I also know it can be stressful to be the minority oppose, wondering why everyone else hasn't spotted the glaring WP:V violations and are changing their !votes. But it isn't a vote and you don't need to change the other reviewer's minds. Stick to commenting on the article (not the editors or the FAC process) and if you raise serious concerns then they will be taken seriously. Take a break, sure. But FAC needs expert reviewers. I hope you can interpret my review as \""to the best that I'm able to judge this article, I think it's worthy of FA\"" but understand that I respect if experts say \""well, actually, this and this aren't right, and that isn't totally accurate either...\""
[Colin]: I'm sorry you feel that way and hope you change your mind after a break. Understanding why Casliber might be frustrated enough to say what he said, isn't the same thing as defending what he said (I don't). I don't know why you think I don't \""assume good faith\"" towards you. Why would I want to you continue participating if I thought your comments were made in bad faith? BTW: I assumed from Casliber's talk page that his first name was (or is shortened to) Cas. I don't know the guy and don't know any of the nominators other than Paul, who isn't exactly on my Christmas card list. Saying there is a \""club\"" makes me feel you devalue my opinion as not independent and rationally based.
[Colin]: BTW: the 25% figure comes from me and is the percentage of sentences that have been changed ''at all''. Almost all those changes are copyedits and I don't think that percentage is particularly high for FAC. What surprises me most is how little text has been removed or added, which is much more common if the article was substantially deficient.
[Colin]: is unspecific and made without supplying evidence. I am offended, as one of the supports, to have my review contribution diminished by this broad allegation. I request you strike that text and apologise.
[Colin]: Well, you'll have to take that up with them on their talk pages. However, your offending remarks have not been struck through. They will remain in the FAC archive long after your talk page is archived and forgotten. I repeat my request that you strike that text.
[Colin]: I'll reply on your talk page, to keep things together.
[Colin]: As for your comment about others not apologising, that's no excuse for not behaving honourably yourself. You ask \""can you not be objective?\"". Well, if one of them had offended me, I'd be on their talk page too. They haven't. I think you feel that me criticising you for making offending remarks should be balanced by doing the same for the others. The difference here is I'm only interested in any remarks that offended me. What you guys say about each other isn't my concern.
[Colin]: Am I misinterpreting that sentence? To me it reads \""Many editors who support this article do so at least partly because they owe Casliber a favour.\"" You were the one who generalised it with the words \""common\"" and \""supports\"". I'm not trying to help or defend Casliber. Stop bringing him into this. You made a sweeping allegation. Retract it please.
[Colin]: Thanks, Fvasconcellos. Hope your Christmas is special and your 2009 is a good one.
[Colin]: I have no idea, and no idea why you are asking me.
[Colin]: I've not had a chance to read the rest of Phagocyte today and tomorrow is looking busy too. I will finish reading\/reviewing it but don't wait for me for FAC if you think you are ready to go.
[Colin]: BTW: how much do you know about epileptic seizures wrt neurons and stuff? Enough to check something over and review? I'm not ready yet, but maybe later?
[Colin]: I'll reply over on my talk page.
[Colin]: Oh don't be so bold. PNES is a diagnosis. It typically affects a certain patient group and is treated psychologically. NES is a classification and although a doctor may (finally) say \""they were non-epileptic seizures\"" the actual diagnosis would be something else. If you feel there isn't enough material, or it would help to merge the two, then I'd reluctantly vote for a merging into NES with the P bit as a section. But I think one can expand PNES sufficiently that it warrants its own article. Have a look at [http:\/\/adc.bmj.com\/cgi\/content\/full\/91\/3\/214 this article]. The psychological cause comes a distant second to syncope, in children.  When the general reader comes to WP to learn about what their doctor is considering as an alternative to epilepsy for these \""seizures\"" their child is having, I don't think it helps to have it conflated with a psychosocial condition mainly affecting young women.
[Colin]: Would it be possible for you to comment on this matter. Any talk-page lurkers with legal knowledge on this matter are also welcome (those whose opinion is uninformed are not :-). Thanks very much.
[Colin]: There are many CC licences, not all compatible with WP. See [[Wikipedia:Upload\/Flickr]] for some examples. The default licence on [http:\/\/radiopaedia.org\/terms radiopaedia] is CC-BY-NC-SA. Although WP is non-commercial, it requires the images are free of such restrictions.
[Colin]: Thanks for replying. There's a proposal over at [[Wikipedia talk:Non-free content]] you might like to comment on. I have a book which credits the cover design to one person and the cover photo to Corbis but doesn't say the copyright belongs to the designer (it might not, I gather, if their work isn't sufficiently original). Could we use such a book cover on WP even though the only copyright on the book cover might be the Corbis photo, which you say are radioactive. Most of the books I've looked at don't claim copyright for the publisher but for photographer\/agency licensing the photos used or occasionally the artist. This makes me think the default \""copyright belongs to the publisher\"" is wrong too often.
[Colin]: It is not a program I normally watch, but I caught it on 4oD. Why did she not succumb to a cold or diarrhoea? Is there something about HPV that those particular lymphocytes are needed for?
[Colin]: cheers,
[Colin]: Sure. I'll see what I can do.
[Colin]: I saw a negative comment you made about alt text. I've not been able to keep up with WP recently but I'm interested to know what your negative opinions are. Looking at your [[Linezolid|current project]] I can see there may be issues writing useful alt text for chemical structures, 3d molecules and diagrams. Have you considered asking Eubulides to help write the alt text for that article, as he is the editor championing changes to FAC, and seems willing to test any arguments with examples of difficulties overcome. Perhaps this will show there are good exemptions, or perhaps he will work some magic and show that there does exist useful alt text for those kinds of image.
[Colin]: At the moment I'm overloaded with real-life work\/family issues. I'd love to help, of course, but just don't know when I'll have the time just now.
[Colin]: Thanks. This is going to take me a while. Protracted. Like anything I do on WP these days.
[Colin]: You are not alone. See [[Wikipedia:Deletion review\/Log\/2009 May 26]].
[Colin]: Thanks, Graham. Very interesting but also disappointing I suppose. I don't think I've ever had flu (bedridden and all that) and guess I'll be fairly low on the priority list for vaccination this year.
[Colin]: Have them watchlisted. Cheers,
[Colin]: The word you are looking for is \""duplicate\"", not \""double\"". If you had used the correct word, or a sentence, in your edit summary, I might have understood.
[Colin]: [[WP:RV]] says \""Revert vandalism on sight\"". I thought (wrongly, I accept) your edit was vandalism. Your username was a redlink. The edit summary said only \""double\"". I am unable to find your interpretation of that word in any dictionary (I do find \""doublet\"" has that meaning). Even if \""double\"" is used for that meaning in some parts of the world, I'm puzzled why you are hassling me for not understanding a term that isn't in my dictionary. This was just an honest mistake; no lecture required.
[Colin]: Fvasconcellos, I have some diagrams of the three ketone bodies at the bottom of [[ketogenic diet]]. I wonder if you could work some SVG magic to polish them a little and to be consistent, and also if you could provide the alt text for them (I wouldn't know where to start).  BTW: do you know why, when I do \""Download as PDF\"", those three images are huge? Thanks,
[Colin]: I've put [[ketogenic diet]] up for [[Wikipedia:Peer review\/Ketogenic diet\/archive1|peer review]] in order to push it towards FAC. I'm sure it is some way away from brilliant and engaging prose. I suspect you are probably far too busy to spend the necessary time copyediting this (though if you could read it and offer some opinions that would be great). Could you recommend someone who you think would be able to spare the time and who has the talent to make the article shine? Any lurkers care to volunteer? Cheers,
[Colin]: Thanks very much. I'll contact someone from your copyeditor posse later today.
[Colin]: Uniform requirements: I see some stray \""\"" round titles, but the italics? Do you mean for the journal name? Just about all the citations I see in medical journals italicise the journal. I do find this makes it easier to read. I see the online book you mentioned says \""Use caution when employing typography, such as bold type and italics, to indicate parts of a journal article citation. Too many variations in type styles may actually make the reference harder to read.\"" But it doesn't go as far as to ban them. Do you think the Uniform Requirements perhaps don't actually specify typography, being formulated in the days of ASCII as a document format?
[Colin]: Plus, aren't those just \""submission guidelines\"", not the editorial house style of a printed journal? Is there consistency when printing medical citations?
[Colin]: Now I look more closely, my sources do differ. It is never simple is it? What would you bold? I'll sleep on the italics.
[Colin]: Since you know more about citation formats than is probably healthy, could you offer your opinion on the issue raised [[User talk:Eubulides#ketogenic diet]]. Citations say \""this is what I read\"" but they also are used for attribution of quotes (which is the Greek or French I haven't read). I'm reluctant to lose the ancient-text-cite altogether as it is useful information. How should I format the citation -- I want to be honest that my source is Temkin so I agree with Eubulides on the need to emphasise that.
[Colin]: BTW: if you are going to quote me on that, please fix my grammar and typos. I hadn't had my morning cup of tea when I wrote that.
[Colin]: No rush. Are you still living out of boxes? I've [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Ketogenic_diet&action=historysubmit&diff=321599529&oldid=321444101 changed] the article to use footnotes. Does that work OK?
[Colin]: Great work on improving the lead text. Thanks!
[Colin]: (unindent) The Liquigen edit is a big improvement and the colours are fine. Thanks! The Ketocal edit has overcorrected. The worktop really is a light brown marble-effect (not my choice) rather than black-grey. The tiles should be white leaning slightly towards creamy rather than bluey white. Both the hand and the jug seem a bit too colourful -- the jug is not quite as deep a colour as apple juice. I guess the original is washed out from the flash and it isn't easy to restore what has been lost or compensate for the effects of the flash. Do you want to have another go? I'm a wee bit worried that the Liquigen photo might fail the copyright test. See [[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates\/Obesity\/archive2]]. I think the design goes a bit above utilitarian, so might be copyrightable. I'll ask.
[Colin]: I noticed the discussion on the Obesity FAC wrt product packaging. I've got [[Ketogenic diet]] going through peer review with an aim to go to FAC soon. I'm now concerned that [[:File:Liquigen.jpg]] may fail the copyright test as the label isn't totally utilitarian. Am I right in thinking that [[:File:Measuring Ketocal.jpg]] escapes the problem? If the liquigen photo has to go, what ways can I re-compose the image (other than one similar to the Ketocal one)? Thanks.
[Colin]: {{user|Stifle\u200e}} doesn't think the bottle label design is original enough, but borderline. The Liquigen and Ketocal logos are registered trademarks. Does that mean I should add that template to both pics? What do you suggest for swapping the Liquigen photo (and the other)? Do you just change the link to your edited one or would you replace the edited one over the top of the original?
[Colin]: OK. You know more about this than me. But for the record, I have no problems with you splatting over the original file. It is all in the version history, after all.
[Colin]: Sure. I'll have a look later today.
[Colin]: Of course. But it is getting late here so perhaps tomorrow.
[Colin]: Fvasconcellos, I'm not sure about the [] round the PMIDs. Eubulides has also questioned them. I think that the fact that the PMIDs are blue and have a hyperlink symbol is enough of a visual distraction without [] markup, and presumably colour and link symbols aren't governed by the Vancouver style. I see you moved the PMIDs after the DOIs. Don't mind either way on that. I'm not sure what punctuation should surround the DOI and PMID bits. Do you think we need a trailing period after the PMID number? Thoughts? I'm happy to make any changes so I'm not asking you to revert and I'm grateful for your help here (which I asked for!)
[Colin]: Sure. Not sure if I'll have time tonight ([[Guy Fawkes Night]]).
[Colin]: I'll stick to books I've read this year: ''Flat Earth News'' by [[Nick Davies]], ''[[The Road]]'' by Cormac McCarthy and ''Blood River -- A Journey to Africa's Broken Heart'' by [[Tim Butcher]].
[Colin]: As requested. Here's the [[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates\/Ketogenic diet\/archive1|FAC nomination]]. BTW: I've used your improved Liquigen photo. Thanks.
[Colin]: As requested. Here's the [[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates\/Ketogenic diet\/archive1|FAC nomination]]. Since your review\/copyedit there have been some minor changes throughout, mostly as a result of the expert review I received. I've rewritten the Modified Atkins Diet section so that will be worth a close look. I see that Maralia is already on the case.
[Colin]: I do hope you are feeling better. Thanks for your careful copyedits. They are very good. In [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Ketogenic_diet&diff=prev&oldid=329734003#cite_note-Kossoff2009a-5 this edit] you changed the \""as of\"" from 2008 to 2009. The reason I put 2008 was that although the source was published in print in 2009, it was available online on 24 September 2008 and accepted on 20 June 2008. Thoughts?
[Colin]: How do you \""collapse the section\"" on FAC?
[Colin]: Of course I'd like you help you with Metformin. Do you mind if I worry about my FAC just now and I'll get back to you. Ping me if I forget. Fancy a challenge? Can you turn [[ketogenic diet]]'s single redlink ([[caprylidene]]) blue? There could be a DYK in it for you?
[Colin]: Disappointed in you, Fvasconcellos. Here I am with some sources of questioned reliability on [[caprylidene]]. And I notice that it has turned blue. Great! Fvasconcellos will have written a nice wee article based on [[WP:MEDRS]] sources. Perhaps even a dead tree source with a reputable publisher and an ISBN. I'll pinch one of his. Very disappointed. ;-)
[Colin]: [http:\/\/www.epilepsy.com\/epilepsy\/keto_news_aug08 This questionable source] hints that an early brand name idea was \""Ketasyn\"". The code name was \""AC-1202\"". The Prescribing Information sheet lists some trials. Those should turn up more sources for you.
[Colin]: Hi Fvasconcellos. I've started looking at Metformin. Exploring the history led me to [[synthalin]] on which I've assembled enough sources for a reasonable stub. I'm out of time tonight but I'll try to turn it blue tomorrow. Wouldn't it be wonderful if Commons had some SVG chemical structure diagrams of Synthalin A and Synthalin B for me to use. Hint, hint. [http:\/\/www3.interscience.wiley.com\/cgi-bin\/fulltext\/108564133\/HTMLSTART Bailey 2004] is one source that has the images (watch: the diagrams spells them wrong with an \""e\"" rather than an \""a\""). Page 276 of [\""Drug discovery: a history\"" by Walter Sneader. John Wiley and Sons, 2005. ISBN: 0471899798.] has alternative images. This page is the first Google Books result for \""synthalin b\"".
[Colin]: Lovely. Thank you very much. Now for the article...
[Colin]: It would help if you were less defensive. This isn't about me claiming to be better than thou (the \""without sin\"" comment). For sure it is easier to find fault than to be perfect oneself. But these faults need to be found and dealt with before FA. I didn't look to see who wrote what when I made the comments, so don't [[WP:OWN]] the text and feel you personally have to defend and keep it. There are more important things to worry about than some bloody Boots patent that nobody in the sixty-year history of metformin and over five thousand medical journal articles has bothered to comment on before [and if they have, ''please'' let me know].
[Colin]: If metformin doesn't obey our policy and guidelines, it will fail just as surely as if it were non-comprehensive or terrible prose. I don't think it would be helpful to restrain me from pointing out where I think the article fails in this regard. I won't edit war on the article text. You can choose to ignore my policy\/guidelines comments should you wish to avoid conflict, and leave it to Fvasconcellos or others to judge\/discuss. There are other aspects of content where I'm sure we can discuss more productively.
[Colin]: If the law of reason was universal, we wouldn't need policies whose sole purpose is to take away the job of reasoning\/analysing\/interpreting\/weighing\/judging\/etc and make them the job of our sources. By refusing to follow WP rules on this matter, you are actually taking away some of the mechanisms that stop Wikipedians arguing. Like judging the weight of an issue: if our sources give it no weight, then neither should we, job done and no need for further disagreement. We wouldn't need to argue whether an event was the first or marked a turning point or whatever, if our sources said so explicitly. I'd rather your response was \""Well, so and so in such and such said this or that\"" than \""I've counted the database search results prior and post this event and conclude ...\"". I'd prefer if our disagreement on WP policy interpretation was in obscure grey areas. It isn't.
[Colin]: Hey, I will ''try'' to reduce the number of WP: citations in my responses. But remember that the article take page isn't a private email and it isn't your talk page. A discussion there will have other readers at the time, and other readers in the future. There are times when it is helpful to remind all readers that one's argument isn't personal but comes from policy, and when one's argument is attacked, then \""quoting scripture\"" is a natural defence.
[Colin]: Oh wow. That was quick. That's made my day. OK, the blurb looks good but the only problem is the second last sentence gives the impression the diet is no longer used. I see the text is 1447 characters, which is longer than the 1200 benchmark so I guess we can't add more. Perhaps the whole \""Developed in the 1920s, the ketogenic diet was widely used into the next decade, but its popularity waned with the introduction of effective anticonvulsant drugs.\"" sentence could be dropped and the \""Developed in the 1920s, \"" bit stuck on the front of \""The classic ketogenic diet contains\""?  Perhaps we could also replace one of the \""The diet\""s with \""This [[medical nutrition therapy]]\"" to emphasise this is a serious therapy under medical supervision, not some fad diet. Thoughts? Am I able\/allowed to edit the blurb or do I request changes somewhere?
[Colin]: Looks like I missed the boat for making the change myself. I've made a suggestion on the talk page.
[Colin]: Thank you very much to all those who stayed up or otherwise helped monitor the page. Despite my fears it only got about 60 edits. Which is just as well as I was very busy IRL yesterday. The minor vandalism or incorrect edits were dealt with very swiftly -- so much so that every time I refreshed my watchlist, someone had beaten me to it. I didn't actually edit the article at all. I see that one person missed the opportunity to comment on the article during FAC, and [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Ketogenic_diet&diff=338448933&oldid=338439076 made their opinions known]! We even had a few helpful IP edits. The [http:\/\/stats.grok.se\/en\/201001\/ketogenic%20diet viewing stats for yesterday] were 37,000 hits, which is not at all bad for an obscure medical subject, and 4.6M hits for the main page. A lot of people saw my wife's hand and my kitchen tiling!
[Colin]: Fvasconcellos, my next personal project will be [[tuberous sclerosis]], though I'll be sure to help you and others out on your projects too, as I find the time.
[Colin]: Thanks. I'm not really interested in the mop'n'bucket, sorry. When I do find quality time for Wikipedia, I prefer to spend it writing or reviewing. At the moment, I'm not even finding time for that. Cheers,
[Colin]: Yes. I read through the Cash paper last night and the lead of the WP article. I've already made a few notes on my PC but didn't get very far before I ran out of time. I do intend to continue with it, though I may only manage a little bit at a time. Reviewers might be getting put off by the complex article title. Not much we can do about it, though you might try adding a lay-friendly sentence to the peer-review-request saying what the subject is and perhaps what aspects of review you feel it needs (some folk might think you just want it reviewed for medical accuracy and feel underqualified). The \""...I thought some feedback would be useful\"" might be a little too passive for to stir our American friends into action :-)
[Colin]: I'm only a little over half-way through my first reading of the article (told you I was slow). At the moment, I'm just trying to see if it makes sense and reads OK. Then I'll check up on the sources to see if it accurately reflects them and is comprehensive. So I couldn't really confirm if it is GA level yet but I suspect you wouldn't have any problems that couldn't be dealt with while \""on hold\"". I'm a \""passed my driving test first time\"" sort of person. Perhaps you could ping a few potential reviewers. The folk who turned up at my [[Wikipedia:Peer review\/Ketogenic diet\/archive1|ketogenic diet peer review]] were mostly invited. I suspect Awadewit is so busy as to only have time for potential FAs but the other names on that PR would all make excellent choices. If you do decide to curtail the PR, I'll make\/continue my comments on the talk page, so I don't mind.
[Colin]: Thanks. I'll look at this after I get home and have had my tea. My first thought is to turn it upside down with the request for help at the top. We're probably going to to get some admin person who won't have the faintest idea what alt-text is and the first thing they'll do is forward it on to someone technical.
[Colin]: Thank you. That's appreciated. Could you voice your approval at the proposal on the talk page, just so any consensus for change can be recorded.
[Colin]: Hi Sandy. Yes, I'm well but busy IRL as usual. I've got Kushner. What do you want to know?
[Colin]: Thanks Literaturegeek, but adminship doesn't interest me and I don't have enough time for WP to make it worthwhile even if it did. Cheers,
[Colin]: Thanks folks. Glad too see you guys are still around and hope you are doing well. I'm currently reading all about [[Angiomyolipoma]]. A possible DYK if I'm quick enough?
[Colin]: Well it is the most common benign tumour of the kidney. Also on my list is the lung disease [[lymphangioleiomyomatosis]] (lim-fan\u2033je-o-li\u2033o-mi\u2033o-m\u04d9-to\xb4sis) -- or LAM for short. It has to be one of the biggest I know. It takes as long to say as most sentences. There should be a word for words that nobody ever says and that are always abbreviated.
[Colin]: Someone who can bend their body into amusing shapes? Off to look it up...
[Colin]: Ok. I only did Latin for 1 year at school and have evidently forgotten it all.
[Colin]: Yeh, who needs such ropey friends [Br Eng]. The ground is even less friendly, and is particularly unpleasant if you drop in on him all of a sudden.
[Colin]: Thanks Fvasconcellos. Sorry for the delay in replying: got distracted and forgot.
[Colin]: Well with statements like \""I see absolutely no need for MEDRS to exist, and would support abandoning it entirely.\"" you could earn your self some ;-). Such rehetoric isn't helpful, especially when there are those who aren't here to \""make an encyclopedia\"" who would seize on that statement to further their cause. Just because something isn't perhaps at FA level of finely honed prose and terse argument doesn't mean it isn't useful. I'm glad you are here to make an encyclopedia. Too few people on policy talk pages are.
[Colin]: Hi Anthony. I'm a bit concerned about your mass edits to change wikilinks from [[autism]] to [[autism spectrum]]. As I noted in the discussion at [[Talk:Autism#Ambiguity of the word autism]], I don't think we can change people's words. If the source says autism then so must we. We mustn't second-guess the source and say \""well, they mean this\"". Also, I don't think it is a good idea to have the word \""autism\"" in an article link to [[autism spectrum]]. People will click on that link rightly thinking it goes to our article on Autism and will be confused when it goes elsewhere (see [[WP:EASTEREGG]]). For example, in [[MMR vaccine]], Wakefields paper uses the words \""autism\"" [http:\/\/briandeer.com\/mmr\/lancet-paper.pdf] and nine of the twelve children were classified as having autism, only one as having an autistic spectrum disorder. So I think discussion of MMR really must use the word autism, even if some people feel the issue is related to other autistic spectrum disorders too. That's just one example.  So, in summary, I think it is safe to change [[autism]] to [[autism spectrum]] (or [[autism spectrum disorder]]) only if the source uses that term, and that easter-egg wikilinks are not appropriate in this case.
[Colin]: Could you guys have a look at {{User|DiverDave}}'s [[Tracheal intubation]] sometime. It has had a go at FAC back in October but needed some work in the prose\/lay-friendly department and didn't get much of a MedProject examination. I've gone through the text making it more lay-friendly. I suspect the prose still needs the hand of someone more gifted than I. But I'm also concerned some of the refs might be historical research papers that document the initial trials of some new equipment\/procedure rather than perhaps modern reviews. The former have their place, of course, but I'd like to know we were citing current recommendations\/guidelines\/opinions. I haven't had the chance to study the refs in detail and just am not finding time to get round to it. Plus you guys will have better access to sources. Do the refs support the text? How's the MEDRS compliance? --
[Colin]: No publishing model is perfect. After all, The Lancet allowed [http:\/\/briandeer.com\/mmr\/lancet-paper.htm this]. What better example of a POV pusher breaking rules to publish nonsense they want others to believe. There are hotspots on Wikipedia where it does't work so well. But there are plenty articles that get no trouble at all. One day, I will get round to rewriting [[Epilepsy]], which is quite neglected yet is as important a topic as AIDS, just uncontroversial. I would love to collaborate with a neurologist on that, and I don't think we lack such editors because of abusive editors causing trouble: these experts are just busy people. Perhaps the [http:\/\/www.jmir.org\/2011\/1\/e14\/ JMIR paper] will encourage some.
[Colin]: Thanks for the kind offer. Don't hold your breath. It has been on my list for years and I've got an [[tuberous sclerosis|obscure subject]] to get out of the way first. I'm sure a [[tardigrade]] would contribute faster to Wikipedia than me.
[Colin]: It is on my list to finish. I'll have a look at what you've done when I get a chance. Need a 25-hour day at the moment. As for tracheal intubation, well you can be sure it is well outside my \""area of work\"" too :-)
[Colin]: Don't worry Mike. I may be wrong. I certainly appear to have a minority opinion.
[Colin]: Fvasconcellos improved the image at my request. Would it be best to delete the original or to just update the original with the new brighter version? Alternatively, if both copies are kept, perhaps the edited one could refer to the original and gain Fvasconcellos as an \""author\"".
[Colin]: That would be great. That's for letting us know the right way.
[Colin]: Because you think that tag isn't the right one for the problems in the article, or because you disagree that there are problems in the article? Either you should have replaced it with a more appropriate tag, or else discussed the issues on the talk page.
[Colin]: I agree that having two style guides on drugs is confusing. IMO the PHARM project is too small to get that styleguide approved as a WP guideline. If we agree that it is not necessary\/helpful, then perhaps we should merge\/delete it. I'd like to see MEDMOS's list incorporate a \""Research\"" or \""Clinical studies\"" section, which would help to avoid the OR that happens when such studies appear in the Indications section, where they don't belong. Thoughts?
[Colin]: BTW: I'm a bit disappointed at Commons talk:Photographs of identifiable people. I thought this would be a big issue given the mention in the Signpost but there's not been enough response to say what consensus is. Makes one wonder if many people even know about the guideline. And permission -- where does Commons deal with that? I've seen loads of medical photos on WP and Commons, many using antiquated black bands on the eyes, or copied from some random physician's website. I'm extremely doubtful that patients agreed for their images to be used for ''any purpose whatsoever'', which is what Commons is about.
[Colin]: I will try to review this. Sorry I didn't get very far last time.
[Colin]: I've been a \""crazy voice in the wilderness\"" a few times on WP so this doesn't mean you're not one too. --
[Colin]: Apologies all round. I will have some time later this evening to do this.
[Colin]: Regards,
[Colin]: I agree that medication's effectiveness does not demonstrate its organic origin. However, a study of the causes of TS would probably be more productively done using modern papers rather than some from 30 years ago. The patient population-set has changed and grown considerably for a start. It must be a tricky problem if our best minds haven't much of a clue.
[Colin]: Science hasn't \""reversed itself so many times\"": that argument conflates a method for discovering truth with whatever is the current consensus. And the degree to which that consensus is ever evidence-based is probably overstated. Fashion is important in science just as it is in clothes, writing or art. In areas where our understanding is most limited (such as diseases of the mind like epilepsy, autism, TS) there will be more fluctuation than areas where there is a solid foundation. I'm optimistic our greater understanding of these diseases will bring rewards.
[Colin]: Please stop adding a section on the Inuit diet to the [[ketogenic diet]] article. This article is about a medical nutrition therapy, not about low carb, high protein diets that are ketogenic. See [[low-carbohydrate diet]]. I'd expect an administrator to know better than adding unsourced sections to an FA. Note also that [[WP:WEIGHT]] requires us to show that reliable sources discuss the Inuit diet when they are discussing this medical therapy in detail. They don't.
[Colin]: Congratulations, Awadewit. Well done!
[Colin]: Thanks. I note that the IP made two edits and the first is clearly helpful. So I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and check when I get home to look up the paper. However, I'm packing for my holiday tonight so might not get round to it till I get back. I really should get hold of a bunch of newer sources to see if anything requires updating -- it may be that the protocol for the MAD has changed.
[Colin]: Your note on Nicola's user page that we use [[review article]]s is too narrow a requirement and actually inappropriate for a topic as huge as Epilepsy. The best sources for an article of this nature are professional books, though I'm sure there are many review articles that would help too. However, as I note above, the article currently would benefit from ''more'' reliable source''s'', not just ''the most reliable'' sources. --"
Parallel_or_Together?,False,"[Parallel_or_Together?]: I am sure that you are aware of this, but [[Zen]] is a type of [[Buddhism]] and not some kind of mystical, stand-alone, new age phenomenon.  On your user page, you list Buddhism and Zen as two different influences.  As someone who studied Buddhism in college, and who now lives in Japan, this reads to me the same as if someone were to list their influences as \""Christianity, Daoism, Catholicism...\"" or, in a better analogy, \""Islam, Daoism, Sufism...\"", etc.  I don't in any way mean to rain on your parade.  Like I mentioned, I studied Buddhism in school and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I think it is great that you are taking an interest in (the philosophical tenets of) Zen.  Perhaps you are interested in other schools of thought within Buddhism as well.  If this is the case... list them instead of just \""Buddhism\""!  Enlighten the average wikipedian who stumbles across your page and perhaps they will research more obscure forms of Buddhism besides Zen, which has become so popular and (sadly) philosophically corrupted in the West.  It is just my two cents of course, but everytime I read something like that I feel obligated to speak up.  Anyway, keep up the good (and unique) work!  -
[Parallel_or_Together?]: I'm afraid on the issue of whether or not Zen can stand alone, outside of the context of Buddhism, we will have to just agree to disagree.  Though its precepts have been widely spread in the West, it is ''very'' much traditional Buddhism.  Granted, it was heavily influenced by Chinese thought, especially [[Taoism]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Confucianism]].  However, through the supposed transmission of the [[Dharma]] to [[Mahakasyapa]] (and I will have to start editing that sorry excuse for an article soon), Zen specifically and purposefully traces its lineage back to the [[Gautama_Buddha|Buddha]] himself.   Zen is also one of the most conservative Buddhist schools, with a strict focus on hierarchy in the form of the master-disciple relationship and an especially difficult set of practices outside of the well-known [[koan]], such as daily chores and [[zazen]] (which is ''extremely'' difficult to do correctly for any significant period time).  And though Zen may have a disdain for the study of the written word, it is still tied to Buddhist [[sutra|texts]] to a large degree.  Of course, in common usage of the term \""Zen,\"" especially in the West, I can see how linguistically it no longer implies (or needs) Buddhism.  I just disagree with that usage of the word I guess.  But like (sorry [[pinyin]], I don't like you) [[Zhuangzi|Chaung Tzu]] said, \""We cling to our own point of view, as though everything depended on it. Yet our opinions have no permanence; like autumn and winter, they gradually pass away.\""  If you want to discuss more though, this is interesting to me.  -

Whatever2009,False,"[Whatever2009]: I see you have made numerous contributions to Wikipedia. Thank you for all your work. I appreciate Wikipedia and took on the challenge of contributing something myself. This is my first article, and I have put considerable effort into it. Generally I have supported my entries with references, where they are most needed. You have interrupted me in the midst of my edit, just as I was about to fix an error in one of my entries. While my change to the lead was significant it does not represent an error. Unless you can show me otherwise, the terminology is consistent with transit usage elsewhere, where track sharing occurs. I used other Wikipedia articles for reference. Since you didn't mention any specific issue it is not possible to go into any further detail. But before you chastise me, I recommend you discuss the issue with me, as I am certainly open to correction, if necessary. You certainly have ample experience. You refer to a serious error. If so, then this should be easy to proof. What discrepancies are you referring to?
[Whatever2009]: 
[Whatever2009]: If line means track than we could say that two types of service operate on the Canada Line. However, in that case we would run into such terms as express service, or full-stop service along a single line. If service were introduced from Surrey City Center to Lougheed Mall, what would this be called? Millennium Line to Lougheed Mall maybe? and Millenium Line to King George? In this case it would be more elegant to simply give the line a new name to reflect its unique route. Whether we have the imagination to go beyond Surrey-Coquitlam Line, or simply give up on naming lines and just give destinations only, such as Coquitlam via New Westminster, or Surrey City via New Westminster. The former would then change to Vancouver via Lougheed mall after passing New Westminster. We could also resort to numbers such as 1,2,3, etc, like the bus. In bus terminology this would be a route, but I don't think this term is used for railways or metro. I will do some more research, and it may be possible to enhance the Line(disambiguation) entry in Wikipedia. Cheers"

The reason for this is that I have caused some users to get mad at me for reverting their edits that were unconstructive, or did not need to be done, or whatever, (as you can see [[User:Atterion\/Archive 1|here]]) and my user page could be a target of [[WP:vandalism|vandalism]] from users like that. Also there are other reasons I want my user page semi-protected.

Jeffareid,False,"[Jeffareid]: On a side note, too little trail is one source of speed wobble. This was an issue for the first year production of Honda's 900 RR motorcycle, where speed wobble was an issue when these motorcycles were raced. In the second and later years, the forks were adjusted 3\/8\"" back to increase the trail and eliminate the speed wobble issue.
[Jeffareid]: 
[Jeffareid]: 
[Jeffareid]: 
[Jeffareid]: I've read about the same neutral handling (no steering required to hold a lean angle) effect not having a known upper limit in articles about motocycle racing. It starts at around 100mph, and continues to feel the same up to the 200mph or so speeds that racing motorcycles reach. Most racing tracks don't have turns at this speed. Daytona has a 180+mph turn, but it's steeply banked. The main exception is the Ilse of Mann (it's a timed event verus a true race), where there are several 150mph to  200mph turns. The racers claim that 200mph turns feel no different than 100mph turns, no steering inputs are required to maintain a lean angle, stereing input are only used to change the lean angle. However the faster you go, the more counter steering force it takes to change the lean angle, and the force is quite large at high speeds. At slower speeds, 80mph or less, some amount of constant counter steering and\/or hanging off the motorcycle is required to maintain lean angles to prevent the motorcycle from reducing the lean angle (returning to vertical). The reason stated for neutral handling at high speeds was gyroscopic effects, which resist any change in the roll axis. Yaw torque due to trail on the front wheel should result in some outwards roll precession, but the rate is very small and resisted by the rear tire which is larger and has more momentum. The reason usually given for vertical stability at lower speeds is fork trail.
[Jeffareid]: I found some videos testing stability on a treadmill from the Delft bicycle research page. The fastest test is at 30km\/h = 18.64 mph, or 8.33 m\/sec, (slightly above the stated capsize speed), the bike is very stable. [http:\/\/www.tudelft.nl\/live\/pagina.jsp?id=0cc5c910-a1ee-40a8-92cb-bf4a2ac54bd0&lang=en treadmill measurements].
[Jeffareid]: The graphs shows capsize speed at below 8m\/s, but the tread mill runs shows and states that the bicycle is very stable at 30km\/s == 8.64 m \/s. I'm waiting for feedback from someone at Delft, but my guess is that tire width is an issue. When leaned over, the contact patch is on the side of the tire, and this offset creates an outwards torque on the roll axis. Tire width and a rear tire much larger than the front tire may explain why the capsize \""rate\"" is imperceptible on motorcycles at high speed.
[Jeffareid]: It wasn't the only change, and Honda made the change much later than I thought. The issue created an aftermarket for triple clamps with more trail (less offset), and is mentioned in this Wiki reference to the 1998 model: <i>5 mm (0.20 in) less triple clamp offset (an almost universal aftermarket upgrade to previous models).<\/i>
[Jeffareid]: Which is why I'd like to see the experiment repeated with conical tires that would deform instead of slip.
[Jeffareid]: In compliance with Newtons 3rd law, and rather than specify cause and effect, I was just trying to state that slip angle deformation coexists with centripetal force. It's my belief that the conical aspect so often referred to as camber thrust is actually a torque and not a linear force. I get the feeling that some of these articles are using the term camber thrust to include factors other than the difference in diameters of the inner and outer sufaces of a contact patch. Then again, perhaps I've generalized the term slip angle too much to include any deformation that results in the effective radius of a turn being larger than the no-load radius of a turn.
[Jeffareid]: Regarding camber thrust, if a single tire is rolling along a banked track, does it turn uphill?

Tenmei,False,"[Tenmei]: This seems worth pondering.  Maybe templates could be developed into a useful tool for parsing the sometimes obscure nature of pre-[[Meiji period|Meiji]] Japan.  If so, perhaps you'll want to give some passing thought to the trivial exchange [[User talk:Tenmei#noinclude|here]]? The process of categorization involves making decisions about what to include and what <u>not<\/u> to include; but if you're like me, you'd bee likely to overlook the \""non-include\"" aspect of any sorting process. --
[Tenmei]: I dunno -- thought you'd be interested? --
[Tenmei]: If this is were a false statement, then it follows that your informed opinion, your objective advice, your good counsel would be of salient importance?  --
[Tenmei]: Can you discern anything at [[User talk:Bueller 007#H\u014dk\u014d-ji (Kyoto)]] which distinguishes it from what I encountered in the early days when I confronted boys who didn't want me to play in their sand box?  If you cannot, as I cannot, then perhaps you begin to appreciate what can be described as a kind of battle fatigue. --
[Tenmei]: As for Hoko-ji: I created the Hojo-ji article -- created it from scratch.  He tore it apart -- moved it without letting me know or leaving a trace I could follow.  That's not good; and I didn't know what to do. I can't sort it out even now and apparently, you can't either.  If this kind of problem is reproduced over and over again ''ad nauseam'' by [[User:Bueller 007]], your prescription here is wrong because it doesn't stop or get better. Instead, it just gets worse and worse. --
[Tenmei]: Your own words are unassailable.[[Image:SatowCalligraphy.jpg|thumb|Japanese calligraphy by [[Ernest Mason Satow|Satow]]. The [[kanji]] reads \""\u656c\u548c\"" (''Kei-Wa''), literally \""Respect and harmony\"".]]  When you encounter editors who are having a dispute or confrontation or whatever, you self-consciously say to yourself: \""<u>I'm here to offer a third opinion, to bring another voice into the discussion, to turn attention away from personal attacks and back to the matter at hand, so that we all, together, can try to find a resolution<\/u>.\""  Whether this is identified as strategy, tactic or gambit, I should imagine that this is the best and most efficacious intervention you can be reasonably expected to offer.  However, this tried-and-proven prescription for creating a kind of intra-personal alchemy which allows everyone to move on is doomed to failure sometimes -- inevitable statistical reality.  I didn't (and still don't) know how to present a catalog of factors which would allow you or anyone else to distinguish that non-standard instance in which the normal calming-the-waters gesture just doesn't work.  I have found that unfortunate exception-to-the-rule to be the case with [[User:Bueller 007]].  Even if we hypothesize that I have only become inexplicably more and more sensitive, and if we assume that [[User:Bueller 007]] is not getting more abusive, abrasive, corrosive, or whatever -- even then, my reserves of tolerance and relisience have grown steadily more and more frayed.  --
[Tenmei]: Re: [[Kyoto Shoshidai|Kyoto ''shoshidai'']] -- I'm not entirely happy with what I'm doing with the list  in this article.  I'm thinking that my work here is a bit too sloppy, perhaps.  I'm having second thoughts .... For now, I was hoping that you'd consider it something like a small step forward, but not yet entirely satisfactory to either one of us ....  More later.  Just wanted to give you a quick heads up in case you were wondering. --
[Tenmei]: More later. --
[Tenmei]: The notes in Ackroyd's book on ''Tokushi Yoron'' mentioned a French text that she couldn't locate; but there is a copy at NYPL.  Maybe when I go to the library, I'll try to take a second look at a 1906 Papinot.  A constructive step in a plausible, at least .... --
[Tenmei]: I vaguely recall you asked me something about lists -- don't quite remember anything about context?  I thought of you when I stumbled across this:  [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Lists]] ...? --
[Tenmei]: I'm not even going to try to think about what it would take to reproduce anything like the [[Julio-Claudian family tree]], but I recognize that the grand result is elegant.  For today, my interest in this is reasonably restrained.  What do you think? --
[Tenmei]: My tentative first steps in creating a family tree are probably good enough. I tried to think of something not too difficult, and the first thing that came to mind was the Imperial line which came to an end with [[Emperor Buretsu]].  I used the template option, but I'm not wedded to it in any sense; but in the narrow cohort of [[Emperor Nintoku]]'s progeny, this became a plausible strategy.  The same template is posted at the bottom of ten pages -- from the 15th emperor through the 25th. What are your thoughts? --
[Tenmei]: Questions do tend to accumulate, but I don't need answers -- not really.  If these seem at all onerous, please give it no further thought.  --
[Tenmei]: I wonder what your first impression will be?  I wonder if you'll be persuaded that this graphic is ready for metastasis, or does the gestalt still need a little bit more tweaking? --
[Tenmei]: No rush -- not to worry.  When you get around to it ....  This is certainly not an urgent matter, not really all that important when you think about it.  Just a small step in a constructive direction ....  --

[Tenmei]: For me, \""adoption\"" is a difficult term to grasp in the pre-modern Japanese sense of the word.--
[Tenmei]: An elegant edit: military base \u2260 SDF base. --
[Tenmei]: As you may know, this sentence may be construed as controversial in the context of an otherwise carefully-crafted article. --
[Tenmei]: The posting  in the \""Proposed edit to protected page\"" section of [[Talk:Hy\u016bga class helicopter destroyer]] was directed specifically to you.  The \""too many words\"" were intended to encourage you to re-visit your opposition to the proposed one-word edit.  Did those words fall on deaf ears because there were too many of them?  --
[Tenmei]: Although you are correct in assessing this as non-urgent in a general sense, I suspect that it is probably not a good idea for me to continue to be slow-going, deliberate, patient. I would hope to solicit your impressions ...? --
[Tenmei]: An ameliorative edit was initiated.  This involved one sentence only, supported by an in-line citation with an external link to a credible source. The talk page record reveals that this precisely-targeted intervention was reverted twice without substantive discussion.  The edit encountered further resistance which blocked access to any threshold from which to begin to address the unacknowledged bias which remains the article's pervasive flaw. --

[Tenmei]: Of course, [[WP:Use English]] is a practical, plausible, appropriate and necessary fulcrum; but I'm persuaded that there is likely to be no lever or force to make good use of that fulcrum. I could not agree more with the analysis and sentiments you express in the last paragraph you wrote above.  In my view, your conclusions are so obvious, plain, necessary that they hardly bear repeating; but merest hint of [[Dokdo]]-type logic already causes me to feel wary, sceptical, regretful.  --

[Tenmei]: Today, now, at this moment: there is no correct or incorrect, no ''pro''- or ''con''-, no right or wrong, nothing to be \""against\"" -- no dispute at all; and in my opinion, it would be a needless mistake to begin down any path which leads towards [[controversy]] rather than [[consensus]]. In that broad sense only, [[User:Caspian blue|Caspian blue]]'s word-choice of \""against\"" within the narrow confines of a single sentence appears somewhat unhelpful, premature, discouraging. --

It seems to me that I've not explained enough.<p>The re-thinking rationale is a variant of [http:\/\/en.wiktionary.org\/wiki\/less_is_more less is more]; but in this context of initiating a working relationship, I  would have thought that less is simply less.  In other words, less would seem to be too little?<p>Like my \""1st try\"" message, this is also puzzling but in a different way. --
[Tenmei]: Thank you for your willingness to help me to re-think a style of communication which is a barrier to my working collaboratively with other people in our Wikipedia venue. --
[Tenmei]: Thank you. Yes, I plan to add nothing more to the currently open ArbCom thread. --
[Tenmei]: I look forward to your further comments; and I continue to hope for action. --
[Tenmei]: I grasp the surface meaning of your words; but I also understand that there is more between the lines. --
[Tenmei]: I will stop posting altogether. --
[Tenmei]: None of the implied questions have easy answers. --
[Tenmei]: I wonder, did Balbur become something like an \""elephant in the room?\"" --
[Tenmei]: ''The following was copied to [[Talk:Elephant in the room]].'' --
[Tenmei]: Thank you for your investment of time and concern. --
[Tenmei]: FYI: [[User:Oda Mari|Oda Mari]]'s '''[[fuzzy logic]]''' [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Oda_Mari&diff=367372248&oldid=367253748  here] resonates with your take on this. --
[Tenmei]: Thank you. --
[Tenmei]: The bottom line&mdash;this person is an appropriate and necessary subject for an article in our Wikipedia context. --
[Tenmei]: The projected \""stub\"" or \""start\"" which results from my small investment of time will become another gift I bring to tea.  I have no continuing interest in [[John O. Merrill]] beyond what is needed to rebut the rationale which informs this speedy delete. --
[Tenmei]: Please userfy [[Talk:John O. Merrill]]. --
[Tenmei]: [[John O. Merrill]] is not an appropriate article for the speedy deletion process. --
[Tenmei]: I appreciate your offer, but that won't be necessary. I have full online ''Times'' access. One question remains: What next?  May I now post [[John O. Merrill]] in main space? --
[Tenmei]: Your edit at [[William George Aston]] caught my attention.  I expanded the context of your edit.  After you review what I have added, I hope you will expand this section further.  In addition, I wonder if you might be persuaded to review and improve a stub article about [[Kim Chae-guk]]. --
[Tenmei]: A couple of good things happened today: A minor edit [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=William_George_Aston&diff=369527893&oldid=346494044  here] reminded me of an article I created in 2008.<p>\u0415\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430 is Russian for Eliss\xe9eff; and it caused me to remember writing about [[Serge Eliss\xe9eff]] at Harvard. It will take time for me to figure out how to explain why this seemed helpful.<p>A more immediate consequence was the opportunity to enjoy effective collaboration.  I worked with [[User:In ictu oculi|In ictu oculi]] in improving the text of [[William George Aston]] and [[Kim Chae-guk]]. This was a very small illustration of what I hope to encounter whenever I log on to Wikipedia. Good news is good to share. --

[Tenmei]: Maybe I've misunderstood what you were intending to do? --
[Tenmei]: Yes, I never had any doubt that your edit was open-ended. --
[Tenmei]: As you will guess, I invested quite a bit of time in drafting this; and I want to encourage you to contact me by e-mail with any constructive comments and criticism. --

[Tenmei]: If my prose on the talk page is unclear, please give me a chance to explain again in different words. --
[Tenmei]: Regarding your edit [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment\/Teeninvestor&diff=375183115&oldid=375183034  here], please consider reviewing what I wrote at [[User talk:Athenean#The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing]]. --
[Tenmei]: As far as I'm concerned, this does not need to be resolved today, nor perhaps anytime soon.  If it becomes a problem at some point in the future, we can address this together at that time.  --
[Tenmei]: If this is not a topic which interests you, that's also fine; but there you have it. --
[Tenmei]: Thank you. This became a [[teachable moment]] for me. Your explanation helps clarify in a way that [[Wikipedia:Hatnote]] did not. In this context, please review my edits [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Imperial_Japanese_Navy&diff=376942457&oldid=376621984  here] and [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Japan_Maritime_Self-Defense_Force&diff=376943289&oldid=376934008  here]. --
[Tenmei]: In each of these broader topics, I'm paying attention to the changeable relationships within related [[cohorts]].  In other words, I'm treating the research and article development as a series of concurrent [[historiography]] exercises.  This is still a [[work in progress]]. --
[Tenmei]: Yes.  For your convenience in future -- see [[Gregorian calendar]]\/[[neng\u014d]] conversion chart associated with succession box at bottom of the page at [[Meiji period]]. --
[Tenmei]: Please take note of [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Korea#Requested move discussion at Talk:Eulsa Treaty]] and watchlist [[Talk:Eulsa Treaty#Requested Move]], especially in the context established [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Talk:Eulsa_Treaty&diff=380859211&oldid=380853049  here].<p>I endorse [[User:Nihonjoe|Nihonjoe]]'s summary of the substance of my scrupulously mild comments.<p>I am especially eager for your close scrutiny of any further comments about the role of [[WP:Mentorship|mentors]], if it develops an issue. --
[Tenmei]: I sought assistance here &mdash; [[Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal\/Cases\/2010-10-04\/Eulsa Treaty]].  I do not know what happens next. --
[Tenmei]: Thank you for your suggestion.<p> The cartoon-like quality of the digitized image suggests that it is a contemporary impression (presumably rendered from the original portrait). No provenance is presented on the [[Nippon Foundation]] webpage from which I copied it, nor is more specific data made available on the website of the small local museum in [[Ishikawa Prefecture]] where the drawing likely originated.<p>In due course, perhaps another image can be substituted? --
[Tenmei]: Yes, you identify the same problem I encountered when I was uploading similar images.  The least controversial choice was to upload under [[fair use]] guidelines.  I can continue to wait patiently  while discussions about this subject slowly unfold. --
[Tenmei]: In the many weeks of so-called discussion thread development, those opposing the move have either been unwilling or unable to present [[refutation]] or [[counterargument]]; and therefore, I propose we delay no longer.<p>In other words, I suggest that there is a consensus to act now on the basis of the Lexis-Nexis search outcome.  The time has come for this article to be renamed '''[[Japan-Korea Treaty of 1905]]'''. --
[Tenmei]: [[Setting up to fail]]: This thread begins with a negative assertion, a [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Rhetorical_question&oldid=397337119#Negative_assertion rhetorical question].  It signals a [[cognitive bias]] filter which  rejects all comment. --
[Tenmei]: We are on the same page [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Treaty&oldid=398121539#Bilateral_and_multilateral_treaties  here]. The unsourced material is now removed; and the three remaining sentences are very short and clear  -- see snippet [http:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=Qs0HAQAAMAAJ&dq=harold+nicolson&q=bilateral#search_anchor  here] in a 1988 reprint of Nicolson's slim book.<p>When I encounter text like this, my normal editing strategy involves adding innocuous prose which is scrupulously cited; and then I wait to see what happens.<p>In this specific instance, my guess is that the awkward parts of this section had to do with the the [[Schengen Agreement]] which was signed in the town of [[Schengen, Luxembourg]], in 1985. The provisions of the Schengen treaty were absorbed into [[European Union]] (EU) [[European Union law|law]] by the [[Amsterdam Treaty]] in 1999.  As you may know, the \""Schengen area\"" officially includes three non-[[Member State of the European Union|EU member states]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], [[Switzerland]], and ''de facto'' includes three European micro-states, [[Monaco]], [[San Marino]], and [[Vatican City]].  Without a specific cited source, this remains no more than an hypothesis. --
[Tenmei]: Thank you for your interest in my recent edits. If there is any part of this response you don't understand, please let me know.  I will try to explain again in different words. --
[Tenmei]: Thank you for sharing this link; however, there is a significant difference between articles which are unavoidably related and those which are the same.  This accounts for the edits I have made, but again, I can only ask for more specificity.  If you identify a specific sentence, I will be glad to work with you. --
[Tenmei]: There is nothing objectively improper or problematic in any of my edits.  You seem to have a subjective problem.  Discuss this on the talk page as my revert suggested. Whatever your problem might be, this is not the venue for addressing it. --
[Tenmei]: [[User:660gd4qo|660gd4qo]] -- Thank you for this list.  I will take a second look at each; and as I re-read the sentences, and I will think of ways to edit them.  However, the overlap of topic is not a problem I recognize; rather, these are necessary enhancements of missing aspects of these related articles.<p>IMO, this should be continued on the talk page of each of the articles you have listed above.  This will take some time.  No one can be expected to address these kinds of issues quickly.  I cannot accept the unstated premises which are not explicit, but only implied. --
[Tenmei]: There is nothing objectively improper or problematic in any of my edits.  Without more specific explanation, I can only guess that you have a subjective problem.  Discuss this on the talk page as my revert suggested. Whatever your problem might be, this is not the venue for addressing it. --
[Tenmei]: [[User:660gd4qo|660gd4qo]] -- I see from your contributions that you have been contributing to Wikipedia since 2009; and therefore, it is reasonable to ask you to indent your comments so that the sequence of diffs is less confusing.<p>I will not respond to these complaints here because the article talk page is the appropriate place for it.  However, I will say that it will take me longer to respond than it took for you to type this bullet list.  You will need to allow a more reasonable time frame for responding.<p>As a gesture of good will, I have responded already to one very simple problem.  The word \""unilateral\"" is in the text of the ''Time'' article which supports the sentence in which you discovered cause for offense.  You can read this article for yourself by clicking on the embedded [[hyperlink]] which was always part of the inline citation.<p>The mere fact that you use the short hand letters \""POV\"" proves that you are familiar with the way things work in our Wikipedia venue.  Good.  We are in agreement in the pursuit of neutrally-written prose in all articles, and especially in ones which are topical and controversial. --
[Tenmei]: D. Whatever your problem might be, this is not the venue for addressing it. The talk pages of the articles you are following have talk pages for just this sort of thing. --
[Tenmei]: [[User:660gd4qo|660gd4qo]] -- Your rapid cascade of diffs come too swiftly.<p>The speed of one new diff after another allows no opportunity to respond.<p>You block meaningful response by posting additional complaints; and this stifles any chance for responding to anything.<p>As I explained again and again, your complaints can be posted on the appropriate talk page, but your gambit is no longer tolerable here.<p>Stop. Your aggressive actions undercut any arguable point you might otherwise seek to make. --[[User:Tenmei|Tenmei]]  09:12, 27 November 2010
[Tenmei]: To sum up: [[User:660gd4qo|660gd4qo]]'s overwhelming diffs allowed no possibility for \""clear and consise\"" analysis nor for crisp prose. --
[Tenmei]: [[User:Bobthefish2|Bobthefish2]] -- No, this illustrates a common English idiom &mdash; [[barking up the wrong tree]].<p>If you review the RfC thread, you will notice that each of the ones I contacted were contributors in one narrow section of [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Talk:Senkaku_Islands&oldid=399778816#What_should_the_title_of_this_article_be.3F  Talk:Senkaku Islands]. If you re-visit the edit history of [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Talk:Senkaku_Islands&oldid=399778816#What_should_the_title_of_this_article_be.3F  Talk:Senkaku Islands#What should the title of this article be?], you may notice that the blandly written messages were serially posted in the same chronological order as each of the participants' initial edits. No, there was nothing wrong. This was a good thing to do.<p> Yes, I am aware of [[WP:Canvass]], but this was not canvassing in any sense.<p>What is more relevant is this: You have rightly complained that the RfC comments thus far were too limited, too superficial.  You arguably anticipated more engagement and greater dialog; and I had hoped for more, too. In response to your express concerns, I invited added involvement from those who might have been inclined to think that, having already posted one [[diff]], there was no need to re-visit any issues which might have been overlooked.  <p>Please re-read the carefully drafted message which invited explicitly <u>constructive<\/u> responses to <u>a question you have identified as an alternate way of expressing a core issue<\/u>.  I invite no specific action other than expanding the scope and quality of discussion.  My overview comment is neutrally presented, identifying only the history which underscores this as one crux of disagreement.<p>On further reflection, perhaps you will come to see that this is precisely the kind of timely invitation which enhances our prospects for developing a broader consensus.<p>As an acknowledgement of this misunderstanding, I can do no more than to copy this to the RfC thread.  This creates an opportunity for others to help me make better guesses about how this perceived problem might have been avoided.  Perhaps there will be suggestions about how I could have written differently --
[Tenmei]: I take your point.  Would it be perceived as a welcome gesture if I were to try to reach out to these formerly-active contributors at [[Senkaku Islands]] and [[Senkaku Islands dispute]]?  If so, I will gladly invest the requisite time. --
[Tenmei]: However, I note that none have otherwise expressed an interest in the narrowly focused issues of our RfC. --
[Tenmei]: It is pointless when an administrator fails to explain -- especially when there is evidence of explicit, reasonable, and repeated requests for help in understanding.  There is an implicit administrator obligation to participate in a [[teachable moment]] when it is coupled with the edit history here.  If not, why not? --

[Tenmei]: Your recent edit corrected my omission [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Julius_Klaproth&diff=286292124&oldid=286277514  here].  Yes, your edit was necessary.  Thank you. --

[Tenmei]: Recalling your experience at [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment\/Teeninvestor  WP:Requests for comment\/Teeninvestor] ..., please examine a short thread at [[Talk:List of tributaries of Imperial China#Japan]]. Can you suggest alternate ways I might have been more effective in this very limited dispute?  In this small thread, can you suggest [[lessons learned the hard way]] which I could have drawn from this editing experience? --
[Tenmei]: Thank you. Follow-up questions like this have no easy answers. <p>This dispute is very low-key, undramatic.  It remains an open-ended question -- even when the focus is narrowed to [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Talk:List_of_tributaries_of_Imperial_China&oldid=403454946#Cite_does_not_verify_asserted_.22facts.22 Cite does not verify asserted \""facts\""].  The content involves only two cardinal numbers and a single descriptive term; but [[User:Historiographer|Historiographer]]'s editing is characteristic, tactical and familiar. Optimistically, this thread might be [[framing (social science)|re-framed]] as a fulcrum for better understanding.<p>IMO, the core issue which justified the investment of time and thought at [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment\/Teeninvestor  WP:Requests for comment\/Teeninvestor] was the prospect of metastasis.  Although [[User:Teeninvestor|Teeninvestor]] has withdrawn from our project, the patterns of strategic editing are emblematic. IMO, it is constructive to search actively for options which may only become apparent after some time has passed. --
[Tenmei]: No. --

[Tenmei]: My intention was simply to suggest plausibly helpful links.<p>If this modest effort was ineffective, please give it no further thought. --
[Tenmei]: IMO, even though there is disagreement about four words, I construe this as a context in which both [[User:Kintetsubuffalo|Kintetsubuffalo]] and [[User:Urashimataro|Urashimataro]] and I are all [http:\/\/en.wiktionary.org\/wiki\/on_the_same_page  \""on the same page\""].

[Tenmei]: I will try to figure out how to add an appropriate English translation to the [http:\/\/en.wikisource.org\/wiki\/Main_page English Wikisource].  Perhaps it can be easily accomplished.  We'll see. --
[Tenmei]: The first step in a constructive direction. --
[Tenmei]: IMO, this disputed sentence is legitimate, on-target and justified -- especially in relation to the parts of the ''New York Times'' news story which explain a point of view expressed by some epidemiologists that the investment in eradicating polio is not worth pursuing. However, if you still feel that the metaphor has the wrong tone, I will want to correct my misjudgement in other articles besides the one you edited. --
[Tenmei]: I appreciated your welcome and helpful comments at [[User talk:Nev1]].  Thank you. --
[Tenmei]: The collapsed excerpt from the MOFA Q&A webpage illustrates the [[WP:NOR|\""original research\""]]-problem at \""B\""-above. In response to Q4, four bullets identify selected illustrative examples: a letter, a newspaper article and two atlas maps published 30 years apart.

For you to imply otherwise is unseemly.  It is undeserved.  --
[Tenmei]: [[User:Qwyrxian|Qwyrxian]] -- YOU are going to complain about this table as proof of NPOV?  Really? Think again.  This is not a good step in a constructive direction.  The fact of the matter is that you have allowed yourself to become a [[shill]]; and for what?  You have lost the objectivity with which you started, and that is a problem which remained unaddressed.

[Tenmei]: Thank you for your follow-up.<p>In general, I have no direct interest in the array of articles about the British peerage; however, my close attention to the development of the Cholmondeley articles seems justified by the kind of nuanced perspective your edit has highlighted.<p>Please consider a hypothesis that articles about the [[Marquess of Cholmondeley|Marquesses of Cholmondeley]] and [[Baron Delamere|Barons Delamere]] may offer perspective for evaluating ways to improve articles about Japanese counterparts, e.g., the [[Meiji period]] ''[[kazoku]]'' peerage system, the pre-Maiji ''[[daimyo]]'' system, etc.<p>At first blush, I wonder if a non-succeeding Viscount Malpas would be better presented as an inline note attached to his father?  IMO, the emphasis in transition can be perhaps better handled by a note attached to his father's successor?  For example, please give some thought to the \""Notes\"" columns in  the tables of the four ''sesh\u016b [[shinn\u014dke]]'' &mdash; [[Fushimi-no-miya]], [[Katsura-no-miya]], [[Arisugawa-no-miya]], [[Kan'in-no-miya]]?<p>I wonder if adding Viscount Malpas in the list might contrive a kind of misplaced emphasis within the narrowly-focused context of this specific article?  In other words, the overall objectives of the article is better served by attention to serial successors rather than non-succeeding presumptive heirs? --
[Tenmei]: Thank you for your comment.  I was uncertain about what to do.  Perhaps you might take a quick look at [[Dwight H. Perkins]] (disambiguation), [[Dwight H. Perkins (architect)]] and [[Dwight H. Perkins (economist)]]?  --

[Tenmei]: If you have made similar edits to other articles, perhaps you will want to revert them as well? -
[Tenmei]: As an initial response, please notice that I have edited the article by adding (a) a Korean drafted-text excerpt which verifies the first sentence; (b) one blandly-worded sentence in the \""background\"" section; and (c) all the source citations you provide above.  A more extended comment will have to wait til later.  I have another commitment which cannot be delayed. Please bear with me. --

Your first e-mail reply rejected my words wholesale without addressing any specifics.  You will recall that I then invited you to read my words again, to consider the content of my paragraphs and the elements of my reasoning.  Instead, your focus was turned toward something other than the substance of my words and the process of reasoning together.  --
[Tenmei]: This comment is a re-start, a first step in a process of engagement. At a minimum, it is fair to describe my comments as neither \""[[non-responsive]]\"" nor \""[[off-topic]].\"" --

[Tenmei]: This is a problem-which-did-not-need-to-be-a-problem.  Simply trying to overlook [[WP:Poking|poking]] by Bobthefish2 and others has proven unworkable.  Is there an alternative or more constructive way to mitigate or avert this kind of impasse? What? --

[Tenmei]: This was not an invitation to \""wade in\"" -- no.<p>My purpose was more subtle, more indirect. In posting this note on your talk page (and on the pages of your mediator colleagues), it was a good guess that your \""[[back channel]]\"" comments might bolster Feezo's resolve, patience and flexibility.<p>Also, I thought it very likely that Bobthefish2 would closely follow my edits.  If so, he would notice the sequence of diffs posted on mediator talk pages; and the cumulative effect of my carefully mild words might cause him pause.<p>My guess is that this gesture achieved no discernible goal. At best, these were a small things.  These small \""nudges\"" represented the extent of my ability to affect the momentum of things spinning out of control.<p>I adopt Feezo's argument that [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_mediation\/Senkaku_Islands&diff=431892703&oldid=431890175  \""mediation requires honesty, but also a willingness to engage.\""]  This small strategy demonstrates both honesty and willingness <u>and<\/u> an investment in speculating about the probable consequences of a few words. --
[Tenmei]: Without adequate explanation, this is impossible. -
[Tenmei]: Mediation needs to be a self-fulfilling exercise rather than a self-destructive one. --

[[User:GaryD144]]'s investments of time and care are noteworthy, but his contributions remain those of an intermittent, [[single-purpose account]].

[Tenmei]: I will probably tweak these a bit more in the coming week. --
[Tenmei]: I see that [[List of National Treasures of Japan (writings: Chinese books)]] is now confirmed as a featured article. Congratulations -- not only for the end result, but also for the way in which your work brings attention to the process which produces it. --
[Tenmei]: In principle, I like the idea of incorporating this \""first impression\"" within our internet wiki-project. At first, the seeming incongruity struck me as odd, and maybe a little bit funny; but across the span of the past few years, I discovered that the 17th century text marries quite well with our 21st century purposes -- especially in contexts like the bullets of a tentative timeline in your sandbox. --
[Tenmei]: Some questions are unanswerable.  My best response is to defer to your good judgment. --
[Tenmei]: Let's agree that not all questions are answerable in July 2011?  Your words inspire a great many thoughts; but for now, the most important point I want to get across is that my interest in specific dates is limited.  As a general rule, I defer to your judgment on such  matters; but if I have anything constructive to offer, I will try to do what I can. --
[Tenmei]: In other words, my interpretation of this text leads me to believe that Maro filled the role of ''Sangi'' for three months only. Umaki was Sangi for one month only.  In the absence of other data, this much is consistent with [[WP:V]]. In principle, even though it is adduced as verifiable, we still leave open the possibility that this may not be the \""truth\"".<p>Your guess may be correct.  There may have been an overlap or there may have been more than one Sangi when Fusasaki died. This is arguably plausible. <p>Stepping back a bit: what we do know is that the hierarchy anticipated that three of the {{nihongo|[[Dainagon|Major counselor]]|\u5927\u7d0d\u8a00|Dainagon}} would serve at one time.

Because of what we know about signficant ''Daij\u014d-kan'' offices like the ''Daingaon'', it is a good guess that there might have been more than one ''Sangi'' at one time -- perhaps including the difficult year of ''Tenpy\u014d'' 9.<p>Also, we also know that rank and function were not always consistent.<ref group=\""hirotsugu\"">[http:\/\/www.unterstein.net\/ Unterstein (in German)], [http:\/\/www.unterstein.net\/or\/docs\/JapanPeers.pdf Ranks in Ancient and Meiji Japan, p. 4.

De cualquier forma no tiene mayor complicaci\xf3n un bot as\xed, dime que campos te interesan: t\xedtulo, tama\xf1o, n\xfamero de interwikis, de im\xe1genes, \xbfalgo m\xe1s? Lo pongo en mi lista de tareas por hacer. --
[Emijrp]: Thanks. --
[Emijrp]: Because italian wikipedia use a lot of templates which have got parameters for images that hide the file extension (jpg, png...), so the bot thinks that it is an article without image, but it's wrong. And this show a mount of false positives. --

[Emijrp]: \xbfD\xf3nde quieres poner los videos? En las Wikipedias no se pueden poner videos de YouTube porque no hay ninguna extensi\xf3n instalada para ello. En Inciclopedia s\xed, porque habr\xe1n incorporado alguna. En Wikipedia lo que puede hacerse es poner videos mediante la etiqueta <code><nowiki>[[Media:Ejemplo.ogg]]<\/nowiki><\/code>, y estos videos deben alojarse en [[Wikimedia Commons]]. Advertirte que no se pueden subir videos con derechos de autor restrictivos, osea, no libres. Un art\xedculo que tiene video es [[:es:Despegue|Despegue]] por ejemplo.
[Emijrp]: Instalar extensiones que permitan usar videos de YouTube en Wikipedia es cosa de la comunidad y en \xfaltima instancia deben instalarla los desarrolladores. No creo que se vaya a hacer porque plantear\xeda muchos problemas de derechos de autor, aunque los videos estuvieran alojados en YouTube.

[Emijrp]: \""My counter\"" uses the user_editcount register in the table user of the [[:mw:Manual:Database layout]] (that counts deleted edits too, but sometimes contains errors). Other counters can use other methods, for example count only the visible edits today.
[Emijrp]: And...?
[Emijrp]: Thanks, : ) your original photo was cool too.
[Emijrp]: I have stopped, but I have a question. Is it Wikipedia in German language or Wikipedia of Germany? I don't understand why Wikipedia must be complaint with the German license laws for images.
[Emijrp]: Those lists are created to see what articles are missing. So, if you say that other articles were created in the past, it is not needed to added them to the list. Right?
[Emijrp]: Sorry, but you german wikipedians must learn that \""Wikipedia in German language\"" =\/= \""Wikipedia of Germany\"". Servers are in USA, and people can read de.wikipedia.org from all over the world, not only inhabitants from Germany. Also, you must learn that \""a policy of Wikipedia\"" =\/= \""law\"". If you have reached a consensus about do not using those images, ok, but that is not law. I have no problem in disabling my tool for de.wikipedia.org.

Alberuni,False,"[Alberuni]: What are the procedures for abitrating NPOV disputes? A Wikipedia administrator, [[User:Jayjg|Jayjg]] insists on inserting his virulently Zionist POV into many Middle East-related pages and he ignores Talk page discussions questioning his actions. For instance, he deletes references to Occupied Territories, insisting that they are \""disputed territories\"" a typical ruse of Zionist propaganda. He insists that Hamas is a terrorist organization and refuses to recognize that the label terrorist reflects his POV and is not universally shared. He constantly reverts edits by users he disagrees with (not just me) and insists that his view is the only acceptable view. He does not seek consensus, he does not discuss issues honestly, he just insists that he is right and everyone else must conform to his view. His behavior borders on vandalism and it discourages objective Wikipedians who are working sincerely to build pages with a NPOV. Any suggestions on dealing with this problem? Thanks!
[Alberuni]: You can see that Jayjg is stalking my edits on multiple pages, even to your Talk page. He redirected [[Occupied Palestinian Territories]] without even bothering to discuss it on the Talk page. He has systematically tried to revert many of my edits and new page creations of the past 24 hours for purely political purposes. Is this the way Wikipedia administrators are suppose to behave?

[Thebladesofchaos]: I've tweaked some wording and added some links where needed, but it now reads accurately. I hope that helps! Regards [[User:Thebladesofchaos|Thebladesofchaos]]
[Thebladesofchaos]: The mention of the series is in brackets as it is just that - a mention of the game and not an in-universe story point, such as being a saga. There is also a mention of this being the third chapter in the saga, which reflects story order, and a nav box that reflects release order. So, all bases are covered.
[Thebladesofchaos]: Re-evaluate what you wrote. You start with ''You put way too much emphases on the navbox'', then we move to ''It is not supposed to be the supreme navigational tool of Wikipedia like you keep insisting it to be'', and '''don't say you aren't because you are''''. And so on. See here for a useful guide: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia:Civility]. It is time to move on from GOW.

Also, speaking as someone in the know, hold off on purchasing the [[Xperia Play]] until it is at least second generation. As with other gadgets (e.g. the [[Ipad]]), it will have its fair shair of kinks that need to be worked out. Regards

D C McJonathan,False,"[D C McJonathan]: This is the English Wikipedia, and Oscar uses the English spelling as the name space article was before your move to \xd3scar de la Renta, so I question this. Even his logo and signature do not use the form you have moved the article to. The redirect, it seems to me, should be the other way around. Comments?
[D C McJonathan]: I understand that you would be correct for Castillian usage, but the guideline for article titles on Wikipedia is the 'common' usage most prevalent and\/or what the person uses. I have never seen him use this form personally or in business. As such, at most it should be an alternative in the article as the name origin, and a redirect from \xd3scar de la Renta to Oscar de la Renta for the rare person that might search for it that way. Consistent MoS here on the English Wikipedia would still, I believe, dictate that Oscar de la Renta should be the article title.
[D C McJonathan]: As I have said before, I do not question the 'correct' if here were living in a country using Castillian, or perhaps even in the Spanish v. of Wikipedia. I am only stating was is correct by standard usage on the English Wikipedia. If he used the foreign form here that would make a significant difference, but he does not, as I have stated before. Thanks for your understanding.
[D C McJonathan]: For instance the title of Bill Clinton's article is not William Jefferson Clinton, it is Bill Clinton, which is the common usage. The opening line of the article has his full name and his name at birth. Does this make sense? Hope so, and good to dialogue with you.
[D C McJonathan]: Not sure that I understand quite what you mean to be something different. I try to check my spelling for clarity. If you would like to dialogue further, how about clicking the link to email me from my user page and we could discuss further. I'm also very interested as you contribute in Spanish and French, both of which I can read and understand some, but am not adequate to write clearly. There are several articles that I would like to see included in those languages. Thanks,
[D C McJonathan]: When I click your 'Email this user' it says \""This user has not specified a valid e-mail address, or has chosen not to receive e-mail from other users.\"" That link on my user page should work, others have used it and when I tried it right now it links to the email form for me.
[D C McJonathan]: The new edits on the supermodel page are great. It was getting to such a deadlock with no headway. Thanks for being bold. My only concern at present, is the fair use on the Vogue cover. A bit more may be needed in discussing the specific cover for it to hold water as fair use if you feel that it contributes to the page. That's a big concern with many editors just now. The copy I had added helped to be specific with that issue and it's purpose on the page.
[D C McJonathan]: Absolutely, well done. I too didn't have the time and the whole controversy with Lil Flip has worn me out. I spend an hour or two just covering his tracks on edits. He almost always adds new names to the bottom of an alphabetical list, seldom uses edit summaries unless he is SHOUTING trying to make a point and he repeats himself without understanding of the issue at hand. He has repeatedly claimed himself to be the expert here without giving us any background. He has energy that could be useful if it were just possible to direct that energy in a helpful direction. Whew...that about covers it!
[D C McJonathan]: Would you believe that he removed the AfD notice from this page again?
[D C McJonathan]: I truly believe that Lil Flip is becoming more of a troll all of the time. I'm going to try and wait 24 hrs before I look at any of his edits. He never gives a direct answer to any question he is asked and repeats the same thing at least six times. Yes, I am upset.
[D C McJonathan]: I would not want to miss your future nomination! Please be sure that I know of it so that I may support your nomination when you do accept.
[D C McJonathan]: It still continues. Tonight Lil Flip removed a template requesting a citation without adding one. No doubt he \""knows\"" and believes that he can deem it to be true. I reverted it, of course, but he just doesn't seem to get the message. The worst part is he does so many edits without seemingly thinking or reflecting on what he has been guided on before, he, by the way, used no edit summary on the above edit. This was on the Supermodel article, by the way. He also continues on any article of someone that at any time modelled to add the line \""former fashion model\"" in the first summary paragraph where often it is inappropriate. I have put this in edit summaries time and again and posted to his talk page. Any suggestions?
[D C McJonathan]: Yes, exactly. No, I agree that drastic measures are not called for. I too saw the discussion with [[User:Hotwiki|Hotwiki]], in fact he left a message on my talk page asking for help and then retracted the request before I got it. What I find so frustrating is that he never does anything once, but a dozen times, then I post a message to him trying to be low key and helpful, I get not response and a day or two later he does the same thing to another dozen pages. i.e. puting \""former fashion model\"" in the opening paragraph of multiple actors or broadcasters. I feel at times that I'm hitting my head on a brick wall. I wish he had an active email so that I could try to be more direct without seeming to wash his laundry in public. If he stayed to his other area of interest, the Simpson's etc. I would just ignore it, but the volume of his edits concern me when he doesn't seem to get the message or follow usual MOS. Sorry to lay this on you, but I just don't know how to get through to him and much of his editing is on namespace articles I care about. He has stared to put models names in alphabetical order within model agencies, although still pays no attention to column lengths...that's an easy one to fix, but it's upsetting to need half and hour or more to clean up his edits each day instead of working on what I might wish to.
[D C McJonathan]: Thanks, well, your efforts with the supermodel article are greatly appreciated. Yes, I think that the mentor program sounds great. Looked at the page, but not sure how to propose, so if you'd be willing to that would be great. If he didn't do such \""mass\"" edits at one time, it wouldn't be as much of a problem, but once he is off and running he'll make an edit to as many as twenty pages, with almost everyone of them being slightly off base. I do believe that he is well intentioned, but if one follows the thread of his logic it can get frightening at times. Thanks again.
[D C McJonathan]: Sorry that I left you out of the loop before, but the only name that I found on the Prod was Kungfuadam who deleted it in less that four days and I had not even seen the proposal. I posted to his talk page and after several days when he did not reply, I posted it where I did not realizing that it was the incorrect place. I have responded on the AfD and consider the list very important. I am sensitive to the POV issues and I wouldn't care too much about the exact article title, it had just been changed once, and I don't care so much if it were category or list, but I do believe that there needs to be a grouping of historic photographers that photographed the male in a way that was not openly acceptable at the time. Many of these photographers were not known during their lifetime to have done this photography except to close friends. Much of it has been destroyed and many were socially known and were not free to disclose this work in their generation. This group of persons is important to keep together separate from any photographers who did similar work with female models which is much more prevalent. Your input on how best to archive this would be appreciated.
[D C McJonathan]: Thanks for your replies and feel free to email me as well if you like.
[D C McJonathan]: He's at it again and I can only assume that he didn't take you up on your offer. He has almost [[Wikipedia:Categories for discussion#Recently created eponymous fashion model categories|30 categories up for deletion]] again. I've left a message on his talk page as well. Thanks."

I'll be more than happy to be proven wrong so I can become a part of the Wikipedia community, as I am positive of my abilities to constructively contribute to this project.
[Drone2Gather]: Generally, in the future I sincerely hope if I'm mistaken again, you and other veteran editors will try to help me by politely quoting the respective policies (I believe here it's called \""inline citations\"") instead of assuming bad faith just because I haven't been here for as long as you have, but have the tendency to edit \""tenaciously\"" because I have certain beliefs.

Cynical,False,"[Cynical]: Abstaining for those two reasons, but erring on the negative side of neutrality--
[Cynical]: I was not 'abusing' the speedy delete tag. At the time I added the tag, it was a plaintext (not standard WP font, don't know how it managed that) dictionary definition, was therefore not encyclopedic and therefore qualified for speedy delete.
[Cynical]: Not being encyclopedic is
[Cynical]: [[Wikipedia:Criteria_for_speedy_deletion#Articles|Articles]] #1: '# Very short articles providing little or no context (e.g., \""He is a funny man that has created Factory and the Hacienda. And, by the way, his wife is great.\"").'. At the time I added the tag, the plaintext formatting (no line breaks) meant that the article was a single, incomplete sentence [the rest of it wasn't displayed]. This means that it qualified for CSD under the criterion I have linked to.
[Cynical]: Blatant ripping of someone else's webpage is not fair use
[Cynical]: Wasn't aware that the photo was released by Robertson himself - since you didn't put that in any of your previous explanations. That clears things up :)
[Cynical]: Perhaps you could give a valid reason why external sources are needed for a collection of uncontroversial, well-known facts instead of just using meaningless boilerplate templates
[Cynical]: Done!
[Cynical]: '''Note: Parts of this discussion in italics were originally posted on Chanlord's talk page, but I have copied them to here for clarity - you can read the entire discussion here.
[Cynical]: The reason I did a copy-paste vote on the various articles up for deletion was the fact that the nominator had done much the same - mass nominated a list of articles related to one university on the basis that the university was non-notable
[Cynical]: Er... at the time you left this message I had made two edits within a 24 hour period. I don't see how doing it again soon would place me in violation of [[WP:3RR|3RR]], since it forbids making MORE than three reverts within a 24 hour period. Doing it again soon would give me three reverts within a 24 hour period, which is clearly not more than three reverts within a 24 hour period. If you're going to quote policy to silence disagreement, at least quote policy properly!
[Cynical]: That's why I signed the manifesto - #2 'An understanding that once these policies and guidelines are agreed upon by the community, that they must be followed until changed by the community'
[Cynical]: In short, I did not sign the manifesto because I have any great ideological attachment to userboxes, but because of the worrying disregard for Wikipedia process. I would be willing to reconsider if the broad sentiment behind the manifesto (preventing arbitrary insertion of policy without discussion, and abuse of power by admins) could be achieved in the current structure
[Cynical]: ''It certainly looks like that will be necessary - under the constraints of [[WP:AGF]] I don't think taking either of the other two to ArbCom would be of any value (especially since DocGlasgow has made a genuine attempt to create a consensus-based policy that will solve the whole userboxes thing, and 'dispute resolution' is the point of this process after all), but I would welcome an RFAr on MarkSweep, especially since [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3ARequests_for_comment%2FFebruary_userbox_deletion&diff=41931095&oldid=41450182 he's still doing it]''
[Cynical]: Because this is being done by many people (it's a process know as subst'ing, if you don't know) in preparation for the [[Wikipedia:Proposed policy on userboxes|removal of userboxes from <nowiki>Template:<\/nowiki> space]]
[Cynical]: Yes, POV-related user categories are frowned upon for the same reason as templates - they allow 'vote stuffing' in discussions (e.g. if a Freemasonry-related article comes up for deletion, a user could look up a list of all the users in <nowiki><\/nowiki> and email them all asking them to vote in the deletion discussion (resulting in a flood of people simply voting 'Keep' without actually considering the merits of the article or offering any reasons for keeping it
[Cynical]: Displaying POVs via userboxes will still be allowed - for the valid 'identification of bias' reasons you indentified - they just won't be allowed as TEMPLATES (ie using the underlying formatting would be allowed, but calling a template [the 'what links here' can be used for the same vote-stuffing as a category)
[Cynical]: That's why user categories will also go, or at least the POV-related ones will (stuff like Wikipedians by Location or Wikipedians by birth year will stay)
[Cynical]: The 'edit summary percentage' on e.g. Requests for Adminship is tolerable (even if editsummaryitis doesn't seem a particularly important quality for an admin). Posting automated harassing messages (judgmental tone is unacceptable, see [[WP:CIVIL#Examples]]) on users' talk pages is not. It would perhaps be appropriate to prevent your bot from doing this in future - and given that other users have complained about this it's probably only a matter of time before this ends up as a complaint on [[Wikipedia_talk:Bots]], which would be a shame as Mathbot was anything but disruptive before this capability was added
[Cynical]: True, but this is unlikely to succeed [or be as effective as the current mechanism] - at the moment people can simply find a userbox template or category that matches their POV, and there you have it, a ready-made vote-stuffing army. The chances of everyone with a particular POV choosing the same page\/image, and being able to justify its inclusion (there are some rules about the use of images on userspace, such as that 'fair use' images are not allowed). It certainly won't make vote-stuffing impossible, but it will make it a lot more difficult to execute, which will reduce the amount of it going on.
[Cynical]: I agree that the 'edit summary usage' on e.g. Requests for Adminship is useful (to people interested in that sort of thing), but I hardly think people are likely to use edit summaries more often just because an automated message on a talk page asks them to. More likely it will just cause upset
[Cynical]: [[WP:VAND]] quote: 'Attention-seeking vandalism [line break] Adding insults'. It may be a matter of interpretation (like so much of policy), but I consider questioning the motives of my vote to be an insult. However I accept that threatning to revert any messages you left me was unconstructive and excessive, and I apologise for that.
[Cynical]: Wasn't aware of that - thanks for letting me know.
[Cynical]: I think what happened was that the vandal had made a total of 4 edits to the article, but not all of them showed in a single 'recent changes' entry (as sometimes happens - it will say e.g. 2 edits by ipnumber and let you compare the most recent edit to the last version by someone ELSE) - so when I used popups to revert it simply reverted from the vandal's most recent edit to one of the three previous ones - had recent changes displayed (4 edits by...) as the diff option then the revert clash would not have been a problem (both I, and the other person who reverted, would have reverted to the same version)
[Cynical]: I understand that my reasoning may not have been clear, but it is hard to write a convincing explanation of argument in a one-line edit summary. The point I was trying to make is that lots of different TYPES of events can be considered terrorist, and the categorisation generally varies depending on the writer's point of view. For example, supporters of the Palestinian cause will generally not refer to Hamas suicide bombings as 'terrorism', whereas opponents will almost always refer to them as such. The same label, and the same dispute, could apply to the French Resistance in World War 2, the American\/British action in Iraq, and so on. So the problem is not that the category is broad, but that it is hard to find a completely [[WP:NPOV|neutral]] way of defining it.
[Cynical]: Done. Looks like it's a pileon support anyway, but always happy to correct any vote based on misunderstanding.
[Cynical]: I wasn't aware that the article was written by the author, but that 'vanity' prohibition has been violated by Jimbo (and others, but most notably by Jimbo) so many times that it is more or less deprecated.
[Cynical]: Thanks again for pointing out the redirects thing
[Cynical]: In addition, just because they are Firefox extensions does not mean they should be listed on that page - 'This is not a complete list. For a more complete list, see http:\/\/addons.mozilla.org.' Since there has to be a limit somewhere, and these extensions aren't particularly popular (according to figures from addons.mozilla.org) it's probably best to leave them out.
[Cynical]: I have no plans to release the modified version, since it would enable anonymous users (against whom a block\/ban is minimally effective since the vast majority of internet users have dynamic IPs) to use AWB which ''could'' (in theory, presuming that a vandal couldn't come up with an automated vandal bot rather than the semi-auto AWB) result in significant vandalism.
[Cynical]: I wasn't aware that 1-Click Answers was on the recommended list, so I've re-added it with a more neutral description. However I think it's best to leave 1-Click Weather out for now, because it's not even listed on addons.mozilla.org ''at all'', never mind on the recommended list.
[Cynical]: Yeah, I had downloaded a new version today (because I screwed something up in my modifications) and it certainly seems better. Thanks for the tip though.
[Cynical]: Yeah it's all true, but the bit about Au Naturale being 'forever doomed' and Valentinis selling 'home made, creamy ice cream' isn't [[WP:NPOV|neutral]] and the pubs aren't [[Wikipedia:Notability|notable]] enough to deserve an article (so they shouldn't be links).
[Cynical]: Thanks a lot, and have a great birthday tomorrow!
[Cynical]: The reason I reverted is that the information you added, while valid and useful, was already included in the rest of the section - so it was basically repeating what was already there. Welcome to Wikipedia by the way.
[Cynical]: I'm not entirely sure that I understand your question, but if you are wanting to get more information on the Subway then you could either ask me (if you have a specific question then feel free to ask, I'll try my best to answer) or try [[Wikipedia:Reference desk]]. You could also try posting on [[Talk:Glasgow Subway]]
[Cynical]: Ah, hold on. Just read your [[Talk:Glasgow Subway]] post. I understand now - I'll see if I can expand the articles you created.
[Cynical]: I've moved the page back to its original place. Although 'Buchanan Street bus station' may be its common name, that is of no consequence. If there is an official name then the Wikipedia article should use that - for example [[Glasgow Subway]] is almost always referred to as 'the Underground' but the page is still called 'Subway' because that is the actual name.
[Cynical]: As I pointed out on [[User_talk:193.113.57.163|your talk page]], the edit was non-neutral and did not cite any sources. Being 'true' in the eyes of one contributor isn't sufficient for inclusion on Wikipedia - find a newspaper, academic book or a well-known website saying the same, and ''then'' you can put it in. Wikipedia isn't a hosting service for political opinions, it is an encyclopedia of facts.
[Cynical]: Sorry, when I said 'academic book' I just meant not something which is primarily an expression of political opinion from someone unknown, I could have been more clear I guess. If the book is from someone well-known then it would certainly be good enough, provided that you write the paragraph in a neutral tone, and cite the book as a source. To find out how to cite the book as a source in a WP page, read [[WP:FOOT]].
[Cynical]: OK, thanks, that clears things up.
[Cynical]: In your candidate statement you point out that there have been many disputes over policy and process recently, and that these represent a challenge to Wikipedia. What solutions do you propose to solve these problems? I'm not looking for a list of new edicts, just a general sense of the direction in which you would take us. Thanks.
[Cynical]: You can use a rather helpful javascript called [[WP:POPUPS]]. Once installed (it's not difficult, and the page gives you instructions), you can use it to automatically revert just by moving your mouse over the 'diff' in that idiot's (or any other vandal's) contributions list and clicking a button. Welcome to RC patrol by the way :)
[Cynical]: <small>NB: This is in response to a message the user left on my talkpage<\/small>. OK, the reason I treated your edit as vandalism was that you didn't give any examples of the 'many websites' in your edit to the article. I now realise (given the links you provided me with) that it was not vandalism, however the information is not suitable for Wikipedia - a rumour which appeared on a sum total of 5 blogs is not really notable enough for inclusion in Wikipedia.
[Cynical]: I was not seeking to hold you to Tawkerbot2 promises in relation to TawkerbotTorA. My point is that (from my impression of Essjay's much-linked comment) you had previously made promises about the capabilities of a previous bot, and then failed to keep those promises. Since you failed to keep promises about the capabilities of a previous bot, there is no reason for me to believe that you will keep your promises about the capabilities of this bot.
[Cynical]: The short answer to your question is yes (sorry to be brief, I've got a lot to do at the moment).
[Cynical]: The reference conversion script I used got confused because you had used <nowiki>{{ref|fn_1}}<\/nowiki> to reference the note, but hadn't used <nowiki>{{note|fn_1}}<\/nowiki> in the 'notes' section where you actually defined the source. In any event, that format is out of date anyway. Marking it as 'citation needed' was an oversight on my part, and I've done the reference conversion properly this time. Sorry about that!
[Cynical]: Just to let you know that I've reverted your edits to [[Battlefield High School]] - the old version also contained the infobox, logo etc. so it looks just as professional. The version you had put in (aside from being a blatant violation of [[WP:COI]] as it was written by a school employee) isn't consistent with [[WP:NPOV]], which is one of the three core content policies and is therefore non-negotiable.
[Cynical]: Don't worry too much about policies - if you make a mistake, people will generally point it out nicely. I've been two years and I still haven't read all of the damn stuff, hasn't done me any harm :P
[Cynical]: One other thing - you shouldn't sign article pages (as in the second quote). Having said that, I would like to take this opportunity to repeat my earlier welcome - and if you have any questions feel free to drop me a line. Kind regards.
[Cynical]: I don't  think the article should be deleted, but because there is not a lot of information available about the school it might be better if it was on a [[Schools in Bromley]] page (or another page with a similar name), rather than having its own separate page with only three sentences in it.
[Cynical]: Done.
[Cynical]: I haven't actually been allocated a coach yet, but since the chances of being allocated one 6 months later are presumably small, I've withdrawn my name anyway.
[Cynical]: You might have porno pictures that 'prove' your allegation, but porn is not a [[WP:RS|reliable source]] as required by Wikipedia policy. For reasons of accuracy (and for the not-insignificant legal reasons) Wikipedia has to be [[WP:BLP|very strict]] about potentially-defamatory statements about living people. If you can find a ''reliable'' source (a newspaper, for example) which backs it up then add it back in, but a porno picture that in your opinion looks like the person isn't good enough, sorry.
[Cynical]: Thanks also for letting me know about that error message, it was an Akismet plugin I had installed for Textpattern, which was evidently not working.
[Cynical]: I am not questioning your integrity. I'll take your word for it that you have porno pics which 'prove' what you are saying. But even if they do, '''porno pics are not a good enough source'''. You still need to find a newspaper, or other reliable source, to back up your claims.
[Cynical]: Well there are a number of situations in which use of the download source could be legal - for example countries which allow purchasers of software to keep a backup copy (provided they don't break any DRM). It is better to simply be descriptive (it ''is'' unauthorised - fact, but whether or not it is illegal depends on the individual downloader and his\/her local laws). In the same way we use 'suicide bomber' or 'kidnapper' instead of 'terrorist' because it is better to simply describe the subject to the reader, rather than attempting to make judgements of our own. <small>PS: Apologies for the delayed reply, I am not very active on Wikipedia at the moment<\/small>
[Cynical]: I would still be interested in administrative tools, however it might be better to wait a month or so as due to exams I'm not very active on Wikipedia at the moment (my exams are this month, so after that I should be back). Thanks.
[Cynical]: Actually, 'United Kingdom' is the OFFICIAL short name of the nation. Unlike 'Great Britain', 'United Kingdom' is an officially acceptable name for the country.
[Cynical]: It's got nothing to do with me being pro-independence (could you please explain why using 'United Kingdom' rather than 'Great Britain' is somehow a pro-independence bias?) - it is simply the fact that Gordon Brown was Chancellor of the whole UK, including Northern Ireland. 'Great Britain', by definition, excludes Northern Ireland and is therefore inaccurate in this case. 'Britain' is acceptably interchangeable with 'United Kingdom', but 'Great Britain' is not (because 'Great Britain' is the landmass).
[Cynical]: The confidentiality question I was referring to was the one on the candidates summary page, which that page said you hadn't answered yet.
[Cynical]: It's possible that I might have misunderstood your views on confidentiality as the summary page I read seems to have got quite a few details badly wrong. I realise now that you don't approve of people not being told of the ''accusations'' against them, however I'm not sure what you think about ''evidence''. My own view is that if evidence cannot be disclosed to the person it is being used against, then the evidence must not be used at all. Would you agree with this?
[Cynical]: I fail to see how I have changed my viewpoint at all - I oppose any use of secret evidence that the accused person is not allowed to see.
[Cynical]: Thanks. I guess with having made more edits in the last ten minutes than the whole of June I can sort of consider myself in wikimood again :P
[Cynical]: 
[Cynical]: I'm afraid I don't know much about moving articles to Wikibooks. Your best bet would be to read [[meta:Help:Transwiki]] or ask at [[Help:Contents]]. Sorry I can't be of more help but I honestly don't know much about this and any advice I gave you would probably be hopelessly wrong :)
[Cynical]: Will do! The article's actually on my watchlist so I'll keep an eye on it and report any vandals who show up.

Mr Bungle,False,"[Mr Bungle]: I generally think the attack information should be in the article, I've tried to neutralize it a bit, may still need work, hopefully it will end up suiting all involved. cheers -
[Mr Bungle]: Hi there,  I added a comment to the Presa page re edit wars and would appreciate your comments about the situation so maybe we can work something out. Cheers -
[Mr Bungle]: Thanks from me as well, cheers for the message.
[Mr Bungle]: Cluttering up the article with a link farm at the end is not really the way to go. If you want to improve the article then using websites as sources is a great way to go. Have a look at some of the better dog articles on wikipedia ([[Beagle]], [[German Shepherd Dog]]) and their external links. Anyway hope you have a read of [[Wikipedia:External links]]. I'm going to change it back, I'm kinda hoping to avoid an [[edit war]] though. let me know if you have any questions, Cheers -
[Mr Bungle]: You are right, I did not want any external links, they are not needed. I initially trimmed them down and actually edited the article to cite the others. After all of them kept getting reinserted I left a couple in as they were not in the references and it seemed they were to reasonable sites. You could have discussed that they were \""not equally valid links\"" on the talk page but did not, which is surprising as most of your edits to the encyclopedia are to talk pages. The most important thing is we are here to [[WP:NOT|build an encyclopedia]]. Some of your comments, i.e.\u201cIf it's good enough for the references, must be good enough for the links\u201d, \u201cThere is no reason to delete these contents, who want to read them should be free to do that\u201d, made me think you had not been told about some of the rules. I did not mean to sound as though I was lecturing you, just trying to point you in the direction of the relevant policies. Wikipedia is not a big deal, it is not that important that you need to get angry about it, just relax, and good luck with editing in the future. Hopefully this is the last of this issue. Cheers -
[Mr Bungle]: Hi there, thanks for doing the GA review for Paracetamol toxicity. The changes you made were also really helpful, I appreciate it, Thanks again.
[Mr Bungle]: Thanks from me also. Merry Christmas, hope you have a great holiday season.
[Mr Bungle]: I tracked down some information on fluoride doses and added some information to fluoride toxicity. Quick question, does Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry really state 1 g of sodium fluoride is lethal? i.e. that would be 6.4 mg\/kg of elemental fluoride (in a 70 kg adult), Seems quite low when children typically tolerate up to 8.4 mg\/kg of elemental fluoride, i.e. that dose in children only produced mild self limited GI effects.[http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=1945630]. Could you check that for me? If correct I guess you can add it back but I think it may be wrong. Also the fluorine page does not make any sense (i.e it states 28 milligrams per kilogram of body mass (5\u201310 g for a 70 kg human)) this doesn\u2019t add up, perhaps we could use the information from fluoride toxicity in fluorine as well. Cheers
[Mr Bungle]: I don\u2019t care enough about fluoride\/fluorine (or Wikipedia really) to continue discussing it on a talk page, I saw a glaring error in a fluorine, a document about to become \u201cfeatured\u201d, and fixed it, I was then reverted and should have just left it at that. Probably against my better judgement I investigated it some more and have fixed it up again. Discussing it further on the talk page will probably just attract anti-fluoride nutters and their discussion of some useless study in the journal Fluoride. Similarly Sax and RTECS animal LD50 data is largely irrelevant to human clinical toxicology. As long as Ullmann's doesn\u2019t say 1 g is lethal then that will probably do it me for contributing to fluoride doses.  Feel free to follow it up more if you think it needs it."
Johncoz,False,"[Johncoz]: While I hear what your saying, I fail to see the point of having banners that are patently out of date in terms of the article they are supposed to be assessing. In the the case of Mexico, we just have question marks running through the middle, which reflects poorly on that team. I will leave them for a week, and if nobody has bothered to read and act on this extensively reworked article, I will again delete them. I can think of no other way of getting some action --
[Johncoz]: thanks for that explanation. One could argue of course that the correct solution is to rework the banners so that they don't require ongoing input from the project team, at least in cases where the teams are under-resourced. Just a thought."
Moeface,False,"[Moeface]: 
[Moeface]: Nothing specific, I just fixed up articles that needed fixing, adding what little knowledge I possessed.
[Moeface]: I apologize if you were offended.
[Moeface]: I do see your point, and I thank you for alerting me. Cheers.
[Moeface]: 
[Moeface]: To be honest, I didn't even know that the list existed! Haha.. to make things a bit easier, do you use MSN Messenger?
[Moeface]: Doesn't matter about Messenger :P Perhaps.. we should select a few articles at a time, and create a miniture 'to-do' list. For example, (it might be already done, I just haven't checked), The Graygem of Gargath, we could set up a table which stated which parts needed to be completed in relation to it.. Origin, History, Current Location, etc, etc.. It should (hopefully), get articles completed up to the point where they contain most relevent information about them."
C mon,False,"[C mon]: Hi! I saw you reverted the edits on the Green League article to \""my\"" version. I'm no specialist on Finnish politics, so I did not want to start an edit war, but I felt, like you, that the original article indeed reflected the position of the Finnish Greens (near the political centre) better. Could you perhaps add a reference to the article to a mainstream Finnish paper that indeed states that the Greens are generally perceived as centre-left? So the next time this [[user:80.164.106.54]] reverts (y)our edits we have a reference to back up our argument. Thanks in advance!
[C mon]: Thanks!
[C mon]: I wouldn't worry too much about the scale since most political party articles are stubs without the year of foundation included. My estimate is that there are around 750 parties currently categorized per year. Even manually that could be do-able, but I hope you can find an automated solution.
[C mon]: Thanks for keeping me posted. It looks promissing!
[C mon]: You're right, I'm sorry for the reversion. I did not realize that the faithless elector made a typo. Since the issue has already been solved I see no need to explain it anywhere. But please next time you see this show some [[WP:CIVIL|civility!]] Do not command people around! Tell me what I've done wrong on my talk page.
[C mon]: Let me start by saying that I know nothing about this party. But I know that such as contenious assertions, which could be seen as slander, if they are not based on fact, need ''good'' references. Preferably the party site or the party leader saying \""this is not a serious party\"" or a third source about joke parties incorporating this party in a list. Otherwise it borders [[WP:SLANDER]].
[C mon]: You are right, the others need sources as well. I will put an unreferenced tag in the article.
[C mon]: Perhaps it is best not to \""overload\"" the Nazism template by adding too many specific German organizations to it. It may be best to create a separate {{tl|Nazi Organisations}} for these articles. I can help you in making that if you need any help.
[C mon]: I'd do only German organizations (may be a separate template for foreign ones) and I'd see how many organizations would be on the template. If it is less than 10 there is no need for categorization. If it is more, you might want to categorize. I'd prefer a substantial categorization (para-military\/political\/social\/economic) over a major\/minor based one, but that really depends on how many there are and how they would be distributed over the categories."
GTBacchus,True,"[GTBacchus]: 
[GTBacchus]: Like, on my user page?  Ok.
[GTBacchus]: Welcome to Wikipedia - I'm happy to answer any questions you have about the site.
[GTBacchus]: You may be right about that.  I just lifted the categories that I saw at [[Supermarket]] (where they're also a bit redundant) and at [[Whole Foods Market]] that seemed to match.  I wouldn't object to pruning.  And yes, it does seem odd that there was nothing on [[Health food store]] yet.  Food retailing isn't really a well-developed area in Wikipedia yet, it seems.  Compared with, say, [[Nintendo characters]]...
[GTBacchus]: It's amazing how much falls under \""Culture\"".  I predict subcategories there, eventually.
[GTBacchus]: Oh, pardon me!  I guess I'm not the only one who stubsorts when I should be sleeping... See ya.
[GTBacchus]: Ok, \""alleged specific\"" is no good; true.  What about \""specific allegations\"", seeing as that's what they are, and some of them (i.e., Plano schools) are manifestly NOT instances of secularization, seeing as they never happened, although the allegation did? -
[GTBacchus]: [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment\/Enforcement]] already exists... -
[GTBacchus]: Hi.  Yeah, I  remember making that edit.  It actually wasn't because I knew that the top speed is Mach 4, or indeed anything about the darn missle.  I sort of hoped that if the top speed really was Mach 2 instead of Mach 4, and somebody knew that, they'd come back and say something, and maybe provide a source that we could cite in what is currently an unreferenced article.  Do you know of a reference that says anything about the AGM-88's top speed?  It sounds like you might have more access to information about missles than I do.  I guess we could change it back on your professor's word, but even better would be citing or linking to a reference where that, and other facts in the article, can be verified. -
[GTBacchus]: Pro-Lick.  I haven't once suggested basing article content on any kind of vote.  I agree with Alienus' statement above about the purpose of polling - to gauge the amount of agreement that exists, as well as to generate clear statements of reasons.  As for asking me not to \""judge\"" or \""argue for or against\"" sources, no, that's silly.  ''Synthesizing'' sources involves critical analysis.  You would do better to use your mind more, instead of asking others to use theirs less. -
[GTBacchus]: Today, I've got a lot of non-wiki work to do.  I'll try to summarize the state of the death argument when I'm done with my grading, in a day or two, if it still seems worth it. -
[GTBacchus]: Hmmm....  -
[GTBacchus]: I only know about this from the note on [[WP:AN\/I]] and some minimal looking at [[User:Billcica]]'s edits.  I see no [[Wikipedia:vandalism|vandalism]], just a wanton disregard for [[WP:CITE]] (and an ignorance of how we use talk pages here).  Uncited, POV edits are bad, and should be removed, but they're not vandalism - let's not [[WP:BITE]] the newbie.  Just demand citations for the \""facts\"" in question.  Then nobody has room for accusations of POV, etc. -
[GTBacchus]: I don't know.  Would you like me to say that?  Would that help? -
[GTBacchus]: There was an edit with someone's personal info, and I was getting rid of it at a different location so it's less likely to be accidentally undeleted, or even seen, later.  Maybe I should have mentioned it on the talk page, but I was trying to call less attention to the personal info, not more.  It should be clear from [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=&user=GTBacchus&page=John+Kerry my admin logs] what I was doing, anyway. -
[GTBacchus]: Oh, I get it now.  There's [[John Kerry]], and there's [[Talk:John Kerry]].  I think I've cleared everything up now, and buried all the personal info in unmarked graves.  Sorry for any inconvenience. -
[GTBacchus]: Um... no, not remotely, nor did I remove your comment.  The edit summary was \""remove troll\"", and I was removing a trolling comment from a banned user. -
[GTBacchus]: Perhaps that's a longer answer than you were hoping for? -
[GTBacchus]: Again with the teacher example, yeah I could see a good teacher being open about their politics - I've had those teachers, too.  I still think campaign buttons or t-shirts would be inappropriate attire in the classroom.  Thus, I'm super okay with people revearing their biases here, but I think user boxes are a cruddy way to do it. -
[GTBacchus]: I'm making this request - that you restore those templates and take them to MfD - out of deep concern for the well-being of this project.  We have a chance to ''not'' start Userbox War III.  Please, let's take that opportunity, to do what Jimbo actually suggested (educate), instead of what he's continued to recommend against (alienate).  I warmly encourage you to trust me on this, and to put your good faith behind a different approach to dealing with the userbox problem.  I look forward to your reply. -
[GTBacchus]: A risky strategy?  I guess that depends what you mean by risky.  Some people think it's pretty safe [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:German_userbox_solution&diff=58507413&oldid=58507118].  I'm not on the verge of going rouge yet, though; there are still good conversations happening, and some of us have to keep up the dialogue side of the equation, if only for the sake of damage control. -
[GTBacchus]: One can't continue to not talk about the [[Elephant in the room|elephant]] forever.  I recently was in a conversation at [[Wikipedia talk:Spam]], where some questions came up, like what's really up with the vote-stacking (sic) situation?  I posted at [[Wikipedia talk:Articles for deletion#Request for examples]] asking for good examples of when \""vote-stacking\"" has managed to derail the proper functioning of AfDs, as I feel certain I've seen, but didn't want to rummage for examples.  Nothing was forthcoming within 24 hours, so I went ahead and did some serious rummaging with the help of a spreadsheet.  ([[Wikipedia talk:Spam#Evidence, of a sort|\""Evidence, of a sort\""]])  Of the 149 AfDs I've participated in, only one has actually been closed against the numbers, and that one was silly - an admin (I think it was an admin) userfied the page after 10 people in a row had said \""delete\"".  Perhaps we should be more willing to close against the numbers if we have to - but that way lies [[Gay Nigger Association of America|GNAA]] and Brian Peppers and [[The Game (game)]], right?  Right now, enough noise gets an article (or a template) kept, and that's an example of Wikipedia ''not'' working properly. -
[GTBacchus]: I guess I can add one to the list of [[micronation]]s that have it in for me... -
[GTBacchus]: Summer vacation? :) -
[GTBacchus]: Is this as good a place as any to link to my latest meditation [[Wikipedia:on assuming good faith|on assuming good faith]]?  Yeah, I think so.  You might both (Alienus and Lar) enjoy it. -
[GTBacchus]: That's actually a bit that I ''didn't'' write, but I think it makes sense. -
[GTBacchus]: Rangeley, are you ok with the word \""(disputed)\"" being there, without the link? -
[GTBacchus]: I'm very encouraged that you're willing to take a long view of the situation in preference to edit warring.  I'm working on a reply to your post at [[Wikipedia:WOT]], and you probably won't be surprised to find that I don't think it's a matter of yes-or-no fact whether the earth is round.  It depends entirely on what you mean by round.  Perhaps controversy should not interfere, but it does.  I've been working on the [[Abortion]] article for a few months, and the very meanings of words get so damn prickly that you can't touch them without taking on a whole raft of political baggage.  I'm confident we'll work something out. -
[GTBacchus]: I really wasn't kidding about the discussion not being a vote, and I think it's a rather important point.  Do you really think the numerical outcome of that particular poll will have a binding effect? -
[GTBacchus]: I don't think these categories should be deleted \""because of an individual's action\"".  I think they should be deleted because they're a bad idea, and never should have been created.  You didn't address my question, though, and I'm troubled by your dismissal of the idea that deletion discussions are not votes. -
[GTBacchus]: I think most of those categories are bad ideas, yeah.  We probably won't stop at politics, but there's nothing wrong with incremental progress, as long as it isn't biased in some way, like deleting the Conservative category before the Liberal one.  Again, it's not so much because they \""can be used to vote-stack\"", although that's true, except for \""vote-stack\"" being a misnomer.  The reasons they should go are much more general than that. -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks, Tony.  I'm glad when I'm able to help out. -
[GTBacchus]: Mmmm... [[gruel]]. -
[GTBacchus]: I've just replied at the discussion.  Thanks for the heads-up. -
[GTBacchus]: See, we've got room for hobgoblins at Wikipedia, it turns out.  Some hobgoblins, anyway, despite the superficial resemblance to trolls, are quite good to have on board. -
[GTBacchus]: I don't think of it as humoring.  Anyway, for Nescio, there's a very specific argument that he's choosing to not respond to: the proper noun misnomer argument, by analogy to the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and others.  I've been online much less than usual over the last couple of weeks, being between homes, so I haven't yet had the honor of interacting with Esaborio.  It sounds like he's holding a position similar to Nescio's: that the name is misleading as it implies that the WOT, particularly the Iraq component of it, is actually a war being waged against terrorism.  I have a lot of sympathy for that viewpoint (as well as for others), and feel it should be fully addressed.  Meanwhile, the lack of that particular bit of information at the top of the infobox for a litle while, when it's fully addressed in the article itself, isn't going to hurt anyone.  You gain more in Wikikarma by not reverting than you lose by leaving the article in The Wrong Version for a few days.  I'm going to drop by Nescio's talk page with a direct question. -
[GTBacchus]: I appreciate your invocation for freedom and against censorship, and I applaud your dedicaion to these ideals.  I would point out, though, that freedom doesn't mean an encyclopedia is a web directory,  and applying a guideline that's entirely consistent with our mission to ''be an encyclopedia'', doesn't amount to censorship, just to editorial standards. -
[GTBacchus]: I've unprotected your talk page.  Let's talk there? -
[GTBacchus]: What is there to talk about?  I dunno, how about whether or not you agree to refrain from doing what got you blocked before? -
[GTBacchus]: So, you're saying you hadn't caught any yet?  I mean, the comment you linked to could quite easily (try to see this...) ...could quite easily be taken as a last ditch attempt to get a confirmation that it's his address.  How is that not fishing?  How is talking about which IP addresses might or might not go with which contributors not fishing?  I honestly don't understand how you're thinking of this. -
[GTBacchus]: No worries.  I hope I haven't conveyed animosity, either.  Wikipedia can be very frustrating, sometimes. -
[GTBacchus]: So, I hope I've managed to get that idea across with something resembling clarity.  Please let me know whether I succeeded in making any sense. -
[GTBacchus]: I went ahead and did the move, because I saw it there, and checking Amazon, it's easy to see that we're just correcting an erroneous title here, and that nobody seems to be opposing it.  Feedback is welcome; it seemed to me like a good corner to cut. -
[GTBacchus]: Hi.  I just want to check with you - is your history merge from [[List of Czech, Bohemian, Moravian and Slovak Jews]] completely sorted out?  I'm just working on the [[WP:RM]] backlog, but I don't want to delete that request (in the September 2 section) if there's anything still pending about it. -
[GTBacchus]: Sure, I'll have a look.  Are we talking about a particular article or articles? -
[GTBacchus]: There's always more than an opening statement might suggest.  I'm not the type to jump to conclusions.  I see we're talking about Scientology, so I'm putting on my asbestos suit.  Now, what's the current dispute? -
[GTBacchus]: Terryeo, thanks for the outline and links.  I'm looking into it, and I'll post an opinion presently. -
[GTBacchus]: I would say that IF you \""violated [[WP:CIVIL]]\"", THEN Antaeus Feldspar did as well, BUT I see no reason to pursue that train of thought.  It's the kind of mistake we've all made, repeatedly.  When someone accuses me of incivility, my strategy is to say something like, \""I'm sorry, I wasn't trying to be uncivil.  Can you tell me what I said that offended you, so we can understand each other better?\""  I would suggest a similar approach, especially if you've picked up a... \""fan club\"", shall we say?  If you feel you're being attacked without justification, I suggest trying to be disarming rather than defensive.  You asked for advice, and that's what I think.  I've also given Antaeus Feldspar a link to this discussion. -
[GTBacchus]: Antaeus, hi.  I'm expecting company in a minute, so I can't give you the thorough reply you deserve right now.  I'll reply in this space as soon as I get a chance. -
[GTBacchus]: Again, I'm not certain what point you were driving at in your above post, so if I missed it, please let me know. -
[GTBacchus]: Antaeus, I don't see anything in Terryeo's comment above that says you aren't allowed to comment here.  I see him asking you why you don't talk directly with him?  I think it's a good question.  Maybe you could read something more negative into his post, but I don't see how that would benefit the situation - do you?  Terryeo asked me whether he had really been uncivil, and for advice, which I gave.  He's been very polite about it.  Maybe you guys have a bad history, but I suspect the first step in getting past that is to stop lashing out at one another. -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks - please read [[WP:NFT]]. -
[GTBacchus]: Hi.  I noticed you created the article [[Sigma Tauri]], and I wondered what source you got all that information from.  Just googling isn't turning up a reliable source very quickly, so I thought I'd go straight to the author.  Thanks in advance for your help. -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks for pointing me to the source.  I wasn't able to make heads or tails of that site, but I believe that someone with more knowledge than I could use it to find information, and I added a link to the article. -
[GTBacchus]: I do try to freak out as little as possible, thought I'm not always successful at that.  Thanks for your kind words, Massamage. -
[GTBacchus]: Hmmm.... I like the idea.  I suspect the article has a lot of content that would be difficult to cite, but it's definitely worth a try!  I'm away from home just now, checking in from a friend's computer, but when I get some more time, I'll have a closer look. -
[GTBacchus]: I disagree that it's superfluous to link specific pages back to the disambiguation page.  What if I'm reading about the 1997 film and I want to know what other Titanic films have been made?  That's the easiest way to find out.  Now there's no link back to the dab page. -
[GTBacchus]: I won't revert you.  I think the otheruses tags are just fine, but it's not worth arguing over. -
[GTBacchus]: You seem to be applying a criterion that makes sense to you, so yeah, I'm happy.  I confess to not understanding why an otheruses link is helpful on [[S.O.S. Titanic]] but not on [[Titanic (1997 film)]], but I'm happy to take your word for it.  I've never learned any particular rules for dab links, and just go by instinct in each case and try not to worry about it. -
[GTBacchus]: You're welcome; thanks for the comment!  Actually, I find page moves kind of meditative and pleasant.  Sometimes low profile is a good thing.  In fact, I think I'll do a few now... -
[GTBacchus]: If there was a problem, yo, I solved it.  It seems &lt;nowiki&gt; tags work wonders. -
[GTBacchus]: I hope I did that correctly: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review\/Log\/2006_October_11&diff=prev&oldid=83298171], [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review\/Recently_concluded_%282006_October%29&diff=prev&oldid=83298434], [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review\/Recently_concluded_%282006_October%29&diff=prev&oldid=83298538]; I've never closed a DRV before, I don't think. -
[GTBacchus]: Not much, pops.  How's it going? -
[GTBacchus]: I'm down with ten devils, up on the downstroke, and pretty much over the rest of it.  But that's all nonsense.  There's not much to reivew at this point.  See if you can add some sourced material to some articles - that's the best. -
[GTBacchus]: \""Nothing reflects badly on me in any way\"".  That's a neat trick. Does it involve a special cloaking device, that makes people's impressions bend instead of reflecting? =) -
[GTBacchus]: I'll probably take another Wikibreak when it's time to whip the final draft in shape, which had better be sometime this month.  For now, I'm safe to spend a few hours on the wiki. -
[GTBacchus]: As for the tug-of-war, I suspect I'm on your side.  Despite my personal feelings about POV userboxes, I voted to overturn that deletion, and would do it again, for the sake of ending the pointless drama. -
[GTBacchus]: I think they're all gone now... :) -
[GTBacchus]: Kappa, do you think you could make a point of leaving a brief explanation in the edit summary when you remove a Prod tag, to help other editors keep track of what's going on?  I get the impression that several people would appreciate it. -
[GTBacchus]: In reply to Seraphimblade, it's not clear to me that Kappa is trying to sabotage anything, but I can see how frustrating it would be for someone who has added a bunch of Prods in good faith to see them removed without explanation.  Kappa, I'm curious, do you find that a majority, or very large portion, of the prods you remove are for some particular common reason?  In other words, is there a particular way in which you see Prod being misapplied more than others? -
[GTBacchus]: (edit conflict)I'm petty sure ArmadilloFromHell made an honest misake, and it would be frustrating to see 100 prods removed for seemingly no reason.  The excerpt you quoted, Unfocused, is correct and well-stated; focused, even. -
[GTBacchus]: Replying at [[Talk:Magnetogyric ratio]]. -
[GTBacchus]: Why did you restore a subjective definition of notability without participating in the ongoing discussion at [[Wikipedia talk:Notability]], where I notice you haven't commented since November 10?  Please talk with us about what you think the definition should be and why, please. -
[GTBacchus]: I see that you have commented on the talk page.  I apologize for jumping the gun.  I'll reply there. -
[GTBacchus]: :I'm sorry; you edited the guideline before you posted to Talk, and I jumped before waiting a couple of minutes.  The fact that the subjective definition has been there for two years might be why so many people complain that notability is subjective, which is the problem we're currently working to remedy. Please consult the ongoing discussion regarding definitions of notability. -
[GTBacchus]: Thank you! -
[GTBacchus]: How is it you're blocked if you can post to my talk page?  Your [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Special:Log&type=block&page=User:Blackdragon6 block log] is empty.  Huh... Oh well, I'll have a look at the BTNH article. -
[GTBacchus]: Ok.... I was just gonna say that if there's any way to mention a particular meme in the 4chan article (need a [[WP:RS|dubya-pee-are-ess]] for that), then it would be legit to redirect...  Anyway, I'll see ya around. -
[GTBacchus]: No problem. :) -
[GTBacchus]: I cleaned up the article a bit and removed the \""speedy deletion\"" tag, after which someone immediately added a \""proposed deletion\"" tag, which is the correct next move in the deletion process.  Proposed deletion takes 5 days, during which time the article could be cleaned up significantly.  I suggest reviewing our policies of [[Wikipedia:Neutral Point of View]] and [[Wikipedia:Verifiability]] and making certain that the article is in clear compliance with those.  Bubbly, unreferenced adjectives like \""very popular\"" just aren't gonna cut it.  That's what makes it look to people like an advertisement.  I've got the page on my watchlist; we'll see what happens.  If the \""proposed deletion\"" tag is removed, the next step for deleters is [[Wikipedia:Articles for Deletion]], a five-day process that involves an actual debate over the merits of the article.  It seems to me that AboutUs.org has generated enough press to sustain a verifiable Wikipedia article; we'll see what others think. -
[GTBacchus]: Wikipedia is both emotionally taxing, and addictive - it's true.  Welcome aboard, and please let me know if I can help answer any of your questions. -
[GTBacchus]: I couldn't care less what makes you conclude that MoRsE's move was \""vandalism\"".  I will not entertain that conversation.  ''Even if you're right'', it's not a productive line of argument.  It is very clear to me that MoRsE believes that this page should be located at [[Finland-Swedes]], and I don't see any evidence that his goal is to degrade the quality of the encyclopedia.  The correct next step is hear and consider MoRsE's reponses to your arguments, and not move any more pages unless we have a consensus to do so. -
[GTBacchus]: Please don't take my annoyance on that talk page personally.  I know you're doing good work here, and that you have to deal with some difficult characters.  The wiki is full of them.  The best strategy I've learned is to eschew any kind of accusation of bad intentions, no matter how obvious they may seem.  The trick is to just focus, focus, focus, and resist the urge to call \""foul\"".  When all else fails, get more people involved.  We've got policies and guidelines to fall back on to prevent anyone from getting far without consensus; let those policies stop POV pushers and vandals without ever having to call them \""POV-pushers\"" or \""vandals\"".  It's remarkable effective, and you avoid a ''lot'' of distracting and inefficient offense-taking, escalation, name-calling, etc.  [[YMMV]]. -
[GTBacchus]: It was one of the more involved history merges I've dealt with; there may have even been a more efficient way to do it.  Anyway, I look forward to see what kind of reply we get from Mr. MoRsE. -
[GTBacchus]: Yeah, I got hit with an autoblock.  Now at least I know what kind of screen comes up when you try to edit through a block.  My record is no longer spotless! :(  I've gotta be careful clicking on block links in page histories. -
[GTBacchus]: I'm extending an offer to share with you my constructive observations.  I think I can help push the situation towards a better, more just, conclusion.  If you're interested in having this conversation, please let me know, either here, or at my talk page, or via email.  I am prepared to offer evidence of my good faith, if that would help. -
[GTBacchus]: I don't understand - are you arguing that we should keep unverified material?  Are there no publications in which non-American wrestling is discussed? -
[GTBacchus]: I sincerely hope you get your wish.  If you ever want to know what I think about how not to feed trolls, you know where to find me.  Peace. -
[GTBacchus]: Are you saying that non-American wrestling should be an exception to [[WP:V]] because sources are hard to find or don't exist? -
[GTBacchus]: I can't imagine what you think my motivations are, if you don't believe that I'm trying to end the drama.  I appreciate your advice on how to be a better human being.  This is Wikipedia, and you should know that I work hard for this site.  I failed to notice and delete a link, and I'm sorry that I missed the chance to do so.  I've helped you in the past (do you remember?), and I will continue to help you if I see the chance to do so, whether or not you believe me.  That's why I posted here today.  If I see you feeding trolls, I guess I'll try not to mention it, since you seem to love doing it so much. -
[GTBacchus]: Would you really, or are you being sarcastic? -
[GTBacchus]: By the way - you clearly don't know how I spend my time, but thanks again for the advice. -
[GTBacchus]: All that said, you're probably right that my comments won't make MONGO feel better about what's going on.  Making him feel better in the short-run isn't my intention with those comments, nor is rubbing his face in what he did \""wrong\"".  What I want is for him to stop feeding the drama, and then he'll feel a ''lot'' better when it actually goes away because he'll be no fun for them to troll anymore.  If he takes some constructive suggestions on board, then we all win. -
[GTBacchus]: So how do you think we should handle the verifiability requirement for non-US wrestling articles?  Do they need to be sourced, or not, in your opinion? -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks for the clarification.  I suspect my willingness to associate with ED people makes me a mystery to more than one Wikipedian, but I'm comfortable with that.  I'll see you around. -
[GTBacchus]: I didn't say the PCW article isn't a good source.  I was just trying to figure out what you meant by \""more flexibility\"". -
[GTBacchus]: g...  Sort of.  I mean, does \""flexible\"" mean we allow a bunch of unsourced information to sit in an article for... a week?  A month?  Indefinitely?  What does it mean?  Better than writing an article and then talking about being \""flexible\"" about waiting for sources, would be to write articles only ''after'' you've found sources, because you're writing them ''from'' sources, and not from personal knowledge.  If the content in these articles didn't come from reliable sources, then where did it come from? -
[GTBacchus]: I'm looking into this, GRBerry.  The backlog is long, so please be patient. -
[GTBacchus]: You mention \""information that would otherwise be rightfully placed in an online encyclopedia such as WP.\""  Why would it \""rightfully\"" be placed in WP without sources?  WP's mission is to provide ''sourced'' information.  Why is it \""rightful\"" to violate our basic policies? -
[GTBacchus]: PS - If you're truly concerned about the ban evasion, you should bring it up with... maybe the [[User:Deskana|person who banned him in the first place]]?  I'm not convinced that I need to care whether this editor was previously banned.  Unless he's hurting the project, I'm ok with him, and I don't consider enforcing our core policies to be \""hurting the project\"", as long as he's civil about it.  Something has to be done about all the unreferenced material around here. -
[GTBacchus]: I'm about to be in-between cities for a few days.  My quick take on this is that we ought to ask [[User:HangFire]] for some input, since that editor obviously has an opinion about it.  Perhaps we can all get on the same page about how these articles should be named.  I'd be happy to drop him a note, but it won't be until the middle of the week. -
[GTBacchus]: I'm about to sleep, then wake up and catch a flight, and then I'll be a guest in various homes for a few days before I'm planted at another 'net connection... so if I don't get a chance to address this concern for a few days, please understand that it's just life, distracting me from the wiki. -
[GTBacchus]: IAR does not obviate the need for verifiability.  Verifiability is non-negotiable.  If by \""preserve the database\"", you mean you want to keep original research on the Wiki, I'm afraid we're not going to agree that you're doing the right thing.  I think everything here needs to be verified or deleted.  Thanks for the update anyway. -
[GTBacchus]: Got it. -
[GTBacchus]: Mmmmm... shoe... -
[GTBacchus]: We try to cover controversial issues in the neutral manner you describe. (\""Here's the issue, here are two or three main sides, etc.\"")  If you can see where our coverage can be improved, we certainly would welcome such contributions.  I'm not aware of another website that attempts to provide even-handed discussions of all sides of controversial topics, but then again, I'm here working on Wiki, and not out there looking for alternatives. -
[GTBacchus]: That's done, cheers. -
[GTBacchus]: Is it fixed now?  If not, try holding down \""shift\"" while clicking refresh - it might be a page caching issue.  Happy New Year to you, too. :) -
[GTBacchus]: \""Focus on improvement\"" is good... it also has the advantage that it's natural shortcut, [[WP:FOI]], is not yet taken.  The best way is to start it in userspace, then when it's getting mostly positive feedback, suggest moving it to project-space and see what people think.  I'd also suggest starting over with a blank page.  Shall we discuss details at [[User talk:Fresheneesz\/Focus on improvement]]? -
[GTBacchus]: That's fine, but that sentence isn't clear.  \""Rare were the reviews of her Love Don't Live Anymore cover\"" doesn't convey any information about the quality of her performance on that song, it just says there weren't many reviews.  Why not just cite an actual review or two? -
[GTBacchus]: Ok, I see where you're coming from now.  It's not clear from the way those lyrics are presented that they're supposed to be examples of ''good'' writing, instead of being further examples of ''bad'' writing.  I understand that you can't say they're good in your opinion, but as it is, it's just unclear what's being said.  Finding a review will be the best solution. -
[GTBacchus]: Thank you for your kind recognition.  I find page moves quite enjoyable, and it's great to know that others also appreciate the work I'm doing.  Cheers! -
[GTBacchus]: I believe I've merged the old history into the new article.  If I made any errors that need fixing, please let me know.  Cheers. -
[GTBacchus]: Seems fair.  Let it be 'B'. :) -
[GTBacchus]: [[I've Got a Feeling]] [[It Won't Be Long]] 'til you [[Get Back]]. :) -
[GTBacchus]: Please be patient; I'm reading your and DesireCampbell's explanations now. -
[GTBacchus]: No problem; I'm in no hurry.  Thanks for the note, and I'll reply presently. -
[GTBacchus]: Patience, grasshopper.  We're close.  Try not to get wikistressed over it.  I think we'll work something out, and it's complicated now because we want it to be something that will stick, and not just be another headache on another article in a month's time.  That's why it's worth it to sit back and carefully think about our reasons for doing things.  Everyone will be better off when we deal with the naming question once and for all - I've seen [[Bardock]] bounce around, and [[Mister Satan]], and now this one.  I'm rather keen to see the issue settled at a higher level this time around. -
[GTBacchus]: You're certainly welcome to seek broader input on the question of this particular move.  The [[WP:VPP|Village Pump policy section]] is one good place to seek outside opinions on such matters. -
[GTBacchus]: Follow-up: I've posted a request [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard\/Incidents&oldid=101311225#Request_review_of_pagemove here] for review of my closing in this Requested Move. -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks for the note.  Normally, I would just complete the move you suggest as uncontroversial, but noting that [[User:Dirrtychristian]] already requested that it be moved to its current title, I think it would be best (and certainly not do any harm) to go through the usual procedure outlined at [[Wikipedia:Requested moves]].  In the previous move, the request was only partly formed, as no discussion was ever set up on the article's talk page.  It would be best to go ahead and have that discussion, posting the same evidence you've shown me here, and then if the question arises again, it'll be easy to check the talk page and see that the conversation has already happened. -
[GTBacchus]: I still think a drink is in order. -
[GTBacchus]: Ok, I moved [[Angrier]] back to [[Wrath]], but there's basically no content there, even if you look through the history.  The actual encyclopedia article is at [[Anger]], or so it seems to me. -
[GTBacchus]: I'm not very knowledgable about image file formats.  I would probably go to [[Wikipedia:Reference desk\/Computing]] with such a question.  Lots of knowledgable people will race to answer your question there. -
[GTBacchus]: If there's nothing at another title but a redirect pointing to the current title, then anyone who can move pages can just move it over the redirect.  If the move target has more than one version in its history, or if it's anything other than a redirect to the current title, then you have to be an admin to move it. -
[GTBacchus]: No problem. -
[GTBacchus]: No problem, cheers. -
[GTBacchus]: I guess that's my summary.  Sorry if it's longer than you hoped for.  Thanks again for the opportunity to collect my thoughts in one place. -
[GTBacchus]: It's already on my watchlist; I may comment there soon.  I'm just now writing a comment at [[Talk:Iraq War]]. :) -
[GTBacchus]: I don't know how I missed that one.  It's done now; cheers. -
[GTBacchus]: No problem. :) -
[GTBacchus]: It's also perfectly fine to simply comment without moving the request, as you've done and seen others do.  We just don't want a full-blown discussion to happen right there at WP:RM; that's what the article's talk page is for. -
[GTBacchus]: That's taken care of.  The new content at [[Option]] was basically repeating what's in three other articles, so nothing's really lost by moving the dab page (with links to all three) over it.  Happy editing. -
[GTBacchus]: Yeah, sure.  I saw it, thought it was a nasty comment, and remarked accordingly.  It was certainly visible to the next person who would edit the article, and to anybody with the article on their watchlist, or watching \""recent changes\"".  If you weren't addressing those who would actually ''see'' your comment, who were you addressing?  Wikipedia is not for hidden editorializing, it turns out. -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks for the heads-up.  I actually reverted the Truman move myself when it happened, so I guess I've run into this editor before.  ([[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] himself used the dot after the 'S', it turns out; there's a section in the article about it.)  Regarding the [[Prezza]] move, I'm not sure whether that title should belong to the town in Italy, or redirect to Mr. Prescott.  It's possible that the word, when used in English, refers overwhelmingly to the politician.  Rather than undoing the move when it could possibly be correct, I've added a move request (and appropriate dablinks) and we can let the matter be decided by a discussion.  I'll also leave a note on kafka's talk page.  Thanks again. -
[GTBacchus]: No it doesn't.  A discussion is a discussion is a discussion.  I don't know why you would want to invalidate a discussion to which you're currently the only contributor offering an opinion.  You think this is some kind of partisan grab for the guy's nickname or something?  I've seen no evidence that anybody cares about the Italian town, just that someone cares about doing page-moves properly without leaving over 100 broken links. -
[GTBacchus]: So, your excuse is, \""he started it\""?  Who's gonna finish it? -
[GTBacchus]: Cool. -
[GTBacchus]: It's all about the tabbed browsing.  Thanks for the shout-out. :D -
[GTBacchus]: I don't know how I managed to forget the talk page!  Thanks for the reminder; it's done now. -
[GTBacchus]: According to our naming conventions, we generally use standard English rules for capitalization, even when trademark holders and the like encourage special typography.  For example, the article about the band KISS is at [[Kiss (band)]], the article about P!nk is at [[Pink (singer)]], etc.  That's why I moved BMTH to the standard formatting, with \""the\"" decapitalized. -
[GTBacchus]: In the future, I'd encourage you in similar cases to take the lead, and state the justification for your reverting on the article talk page.  This will encourage the other editor to reply there, which is generally a step in the right direction, away from edit-warring and towards discussion. -
[GTBacchus]: It wasn't clear to me why [[Remo (company)]] was the primary topic at [[Remo (disambiguation)]].  I agree that either the dab page or the page about the primary topic should be at the main title, rather than having [[Remo]] redirect to either [[Remo (company)]] or [[Remo (disambiguation)]].  If you say that the company is clearly more important than the language or anything else there, I'll take your word for it, and won't revert. -
[GTBacchus]: Huh.  According to the second paragraph of [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants]], so-called \""hallucinogenic\"" drugs do not produce hallucinations, but merely distort ordinary sense input. -
[GTBacchus]: No problem; thank you for helping out with the move.  There's not really an \""official\"" procedure; anyone completinging a move request is welcome to remove the template from the talk page and delist the request at [[WP:RM]].  Otherwise, one of us RM regulars will show up and close it out eventually. -
[GTBacchus]: I've moved it to that title now; thanks for the heads-up. -
[GTBacchus]: No problem; thank you for helping out with the article! -
[GTBacchus]: I think they'll certainly be closed together; but I don't feel I should close them, as I've definitely taken a side in the discussion.  I'll leave notes in both discussions alerting the closing admin to treat the two requests\/discussions as one. -
[GTBacchus]: As for changing the spelling within the article, I would have done well to change it when moving the article, and you're right to point that out to me.  I'll fix it now. -
[GTBacchus]: Excuse me, but I'm not trying to \""argue for an anglicized spelling\""; I'm just trying to get the page titled according to common usage.  I have no stake in what this page is called, and don't care which name turns out to be more common.  We got different Google results because you included quotation marks and I didn't, not realizing that they would affect the results for a single-word search.  I was using the best information I had available - look at my search results.  You don't need to tell me that I \""have no reason\"" as if I was somehow acting in bad faith.  I'm giving my time to help maintain this resource, and I don't appreciate being talked down to, alright? -
[GTBacchus]: I've started a new section at [[Talk:Reggaeton]] for addressing this question. -
[GTBacchus]: I've merged the histories at [[Matchbox Twenty]], which is correct according to our house style, regardless of how the band chooses to capitalize their name.  Thanks for the heads-up. -
[GTBacchus]: You're welcome to let me know about similar situations.  I've been doing a lot of page moves for the last few months, so I'm fairly practiced when it comes to history merges and the like.  Posting requests at [[WP:RM#Uncontroversial proposals]] will also get my attention pretty quickly, as I process requests there just about every day. -
[GTBacchus]: Oops, sorry about that.  I've fixed it now, and on the plus side, there are now redirects from [[PdfEdit]] ''and'' [[PDFEdit]]!  Thanks for catching my mistake. -
[GTBacchus]: Yeah, the \""unless it is unique\"" phrasing isn't even clear.  I noticed there are already a couple of talk page topics about that sentence, but I need to do a little more reading before I dive in. -
[GTBacchus]: I definitely don't think of it as a binding vote, and no decision will be made based purely on numbers.  I also wouldn't worry about the five-day limit.  We're pretty flexible with that sort of thing at [[WP:RM]], as you can tell by looking at the backlog!  Maybe that's why I was so casual about opening a \""formal\"" survey.  It's just a way to get the discussion ball rolling; there's no reason to think it'll be closed before everybody's had their chance to process the discussion.  At least, that's been my experience with RM discussions. -
[GTBacchus]: No, I don't think completing the move despite the \""no consensus\"" close is the appropriate way to handle the situation.  I think an RfC on the pages would be more appropriate, and it's probably worth doing, because I'll be interested to know if the general consensus about avoiding eccentric typography is actually changing, or if, as I suspect, this case is a fluke. -
[GTBacchus]: Yeah, you seem to be taking a stand for bowing to consensus over guidelines.  I try, in handling move requests, to pay attention to a broader consensus sometimes than is represented on the talk page in question.  In this case, as I told TJ Spyke above, I think it would be appropriate to set up an article RFC to get a wider opinion on the matter, because I'm pretty sure the general consensus is against such renderings of titles. -
[GTBacchus]: I can't really say it isn't, but whether I would actually say it is, in order to exploit a loophole in some ArbCom decision... no I wouldn't say that.  I would just RFC the page and tap into the community, which is either broadly against eccentric typography, or else we ought to know that the climate has changed, which would be a shame, IMO. -
[GTBacchus]: I think it's best to run category renames through [[WP:CFD|CFD]].  They've got a whole procedure there, and I've lost time in the past by ''not'' following it, because sometimes someone objects, and then you go through the whole process anyway. -
[GTBacchus]: I don't think it would be very... um, cool of me not to keep an eye on it... ;) -
[GTBacchus]: I won't be spending ''very'' many hours online for the next few days, but I've watchlisted the talk page in question, and I'll definitely check in occasionally.  Good luck with your paper. -
[GTBacchus]: Hi, Mackan.  I'm in a situation where my Internet access has been very limited for the past few days.  Please don't think I'm ignoring you; when I get my regular connection restored, this is at the top of my priority list. -
[GTBacchus]: I see a couple of problems with this paragraph.  First of all, that link to \""Western world\"" makes no sense - what is being claimed here?  Second, that external link is in Japanese, and I can't read it.  What information am I supposed to be using that link to verify, anyway?  The URL looks commercial - is that a website selling something, or what?  Linking to the Japanese wikipedia is also problematic, but my first question about it is, what article is that?  Can someone provide some hints for the linguistically limited like myself?  I'd like to figure out what all there reversions are about. -
[GTBacchus]: Hi. Thanks for the note. I guess I'm not seeing what the argument is for using the diacritic in this person's name. According to what people were saying in the move discussion, the media as well as the subject himself use the rendering \""Delic\"". Thus, according to [[WP:COMMONNAME]], that's what we should call him as well. I didn't close the discussion based on a vote count, but rather based on the arguments presented. I didn't see anybody arguing that the rendering \""Deli\u0107\"" is commonly used, or even preferred by the subject, but I'd be open to looking at evidence. -
[GTBacchus]: You're not the first to disagree with this aspect of our naming conventions, and if you look at the talk page of the guideline on diacritics, you'll see thousands of words of debate on the subject.  I don't think it would be appropriate for me to move this article back against our usual practice, unless it's either demonstrated that the form with the diacritic is the common English usage, or else that the community deems the case worthy of making an exception.  To that end, you're welcome to file a content [[WP:RFC|RFC]], and I can even un-close the move discussion while it runs, if that would help. -
[GTBacchus]: Hi, Severa.  I've added both of those pages to my watchlist, and I'll have a look at the situation.  I should have some time either before or after the weekend. -
[GTBacchus]: Have you got any arguments or evidence that Akko is actually more commonly used in English language sources?  That's the best, most neutral criterion we've come up with for naming geographic places, and there's a strong consensus for it.  You might disagree with favoring the most common name over the most \""correct\"", but as long as that's our rule, I don't see why this case should be an exception. -
[GTBacchus]: I closed the move request in the prescribed time, and based my decision on every word that was typed in the designated section.  If you want to become an admin, close move requests every day, and seek out and read all of the context of each one, even when people don't bother to register an opinion in the survey... then please be my guest.  I'm a volunteer, and I'm batting about .950, so I'll sleep just fine knowing you think I made a bad call.  Have a nice day. -
[GTBacchus]: I'm sorry but I can't tell which article you're talking about.  I move hundreds of pages; can you provide me with a link? -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks for the note, Dmcdevit. :) I would have to take the train down to Portland after work and then hurry back the same night, so I doubt I'll make it, making this the second time I've missed Jimbo in Portland since moving from there to Seattle last summer.  D'oh! -
[GTBacchus]: Never mind; I found it at [[Talk:Human-computer interaction]]. -
[GTBacchus]: I think there's at least one good way to word it with the first word being \""Discordianism\"".  At the very least, \""Discordianism\"" should be capitalized. -
[GTBacchus]: On what makes a source reliable, see [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources]].  Basically, we look for information that's appeared in publications with reputations for academic rigor, or at least fact-checking.  In this case, one would consult respected reference books about religion (many exist), and find out how they define Christianity.  Then we can just state their definition and tell where it comes from.  If sources disagree, we can report that.  Then everything's [[WP:V|verifiable]], and nothing's [[WP:NOR|original research]]. -
[GTBacchus]: Nobody can keep up with all the stub types.  I generally pick a nice general one, like {{tl|org-stub}} in this case, and then look in the category, [[:Category:Organization stubs]], for an appropriate sub-category.  If a good sub-category doesn't jump out at you, then the general org-stub is fine.  I hope that helps. -
[GTBacchus]: It wouldn't matter much if you slandered Radiant to me; I wouldn't believe you.  I already know he's one of the Good Guys, as are you, Netscott.  On point, I will be checking out [[WP:STRAW]] much more thoroughly later this afternoon.  I can imagine arguments for and against merging PNSD and STRAW.  We'll hash those out, and come to some sort of consensus, I'm confident.  For now, I must get back to work. -
[GTBacchus]: That's about as much sense as it all makes to me.  My suggestion is just to copy his user page wholesale and then make small changes until it becomes your user page, being sure not to break any of the mysterious code.  If you need someone to look over your code, I could maybe proofread it, but like I said, I'm no expert.  I hope that helps. -
[GTBacchus]: How do you feel about the idea of making a single page, [[Wikipedia:Polling]], with sections covering what's now covered in PNSD and STRAW?  I'm not sure I see anybody opposing such a merge. -
[GTBacchus]: See, nobody seems to actually oppose this idea, is it just a matter of somebody taking the initiative and refactoring the two pages into one? -
[GTBacchus]: And that's determined how? -
[GTBacchus]: It appears the opposition is coming from Grace Note and Guy, actually.  I think a poll would be rather unhelpful at this point. -
[GTBacchus]: I've left notes at [[User talk:OrbitComplete]] and [[Talk:TNA (disambiguation)]].  This way takes a little longer than just using the mop, but it's worth it in the long run. -
[GTBacchus]: I've left him a note regarding the personal attacks.  Regarding the article, I suggest you stop reverting him.  If you have to revert the same edit more than once, it's a very good idea to get more people involved.  I would suggest visiting [[WP:3O]] and getting an uninvolved voice to weigh in over the edits in question.  Simply reverting the user again and again makes it look as if you're both edit warriors. -
[GTBacchus]: MONGO, you're of course welcome to delete this, but I don't appreciate having my good faith attempts to improve Wikipedia characterized as \""trolling\"". I also have no idea what you mean by calling me an \""ED partisan\"" (considering that everything I've ever done at this website has been motivated by improving Wikipedia). I'm genuinely curious what you imagine my motives are. I doubt you'll reply or do anything other than delete this message as \""trolling\"", but you are so wrong about me. I have done, and will continue to do, everything in my power to support and protect this website, and you, MONGO, an excellent Wikipedian. Whether you believe it or not, I'm on your side. -
[GTBacchus]: Sometimes, people you think are your enemies are really your friends. -
[GTBacchus]: I'm headed out, too. I hope it's as beautiful a day where you are as it is here in Seattle. I'll see you around. -
[GTBacchus]: Jc37, hi.  I'm replying here to what you posted at [[WP:AN\/I#Are users appearing in user categories disruptive and does it warrant a block?|AN\/I]].  I just wanted to clarify that it was certainly a misconception, and not misdirection that I was mistaken about the genesis of UCFD.  I appreciate the clarification you provided; thank you. -
[GTBacchus]: Welcome to Wikipedia, by the way, and congratulations, on uh... your username. -
[GTBacchus]: I think that purpose is served, to some extent, by IAR's talk page.  I look forward to seeing you there. -
[GTBacchus]: De nada. :) -
[GTBacchus]: Actually, that's inaccurate.  I've never responded that way in an AfD, and I never would.  I've responded that way at UCFD, which [[WP:HARMLESS]] does not address.  That guideline refers quite explicitly to ''articles'', and there's a big difference. -
[GTBacchus]: The best response is to get quickly to a forum where admins are certainly available around the clock.  The first thing to come to mind was AN\/I, but as you pointed out, that's fatally flawed.  I think a batch of emails or a visit to irc would be a good next step.  Revert warring without the power to win quickly and decisively is actively harmful, because of RC.  Revert wars attract attention. -
[GTBacchus]: The only reason I can see for ''not'' allowing people to do what they want with user categories is if they're hurting the project in some way.  If we're going to disallow some, then we ought to disallow them all.  There's no excuse for standing anywhere in the middle, choosing to approve some people's unencyclopedic categories and not others'. -
[GTBacchus]: What I see is people telling others what to do with no project-based reason.  Wikipedia is not an exercise in governance, and UCFD's attempts at governance are upsetting contributors.  So what's it's excuse?  Where's the benefit that outweighs that disadvantage? -
[GTBacchus]: It just seems really weird to me now, that we're deleting the ha-ha-funny categories, but keeping the potentially destructive ideological categories, which are no more encyclopedic.  What kind of goal have we got in mind for user categories, and how are we supposed to get there?  I'm willing to help, but at this point, I don't get it. -
[GTBacchus]: You're welcome. :) Thanks for your note. -
[GTBacchus]: It's a totally arbitrary exercise is telling others what to do.  Deleting frivilous user categories doesn't help the project, and it bugs people who work on the project, therefore it seems harmful to me. -
[GTBacchus]: Already done. :) -
[GTBacchus]: The image with the penis is deleted.  I wouldn't worry about the 3RR; reverting vandalism is certainly an exception, and that image was definitely vandalism.  If the image reappears, or if you need any more assistance, please let me know.  Thanks for helping out! -
[GTBacchus]: Would you care to point out where I attacked you?  Is it a personal attack to point out that you have failed to respond to a particular argument?  I certainly don't wish to make any claims about you as a person, and I don't believe I have.  I hope you'll point out to me what was uncivil about my message; otherwise, I'm puzzled. -
[GTBacchus]: For the umpteenth time, neither can I.  I'm against linking to attack sites.  I do find it frustrating that you seem incredibly eager to do something that will ''reduce'' security, without even responding to the suggestion that it will do so.  I don't think you've addressed the argument that I've made, and I do think you're pursuing a goal that will turn around and bite you in the ass.  It's because I don't want that to happen that I oppose the policy in question.  I'm trying to protect Wikipedians and not to set out pots of beans.  Why, why, why won't you even address this point?  Why do you shoot yourself in the foot?  Why?  I don't imagine it's intentional, but will you even consider that I might be making a point worth thinking about? <p> Again: I am fully against linking to what you call \""attack websites\"".  I note that your calling them that is hurting your position.  You don't have to care, but I'd think you would.  You don't have to put effective protection in place, but I'd think you would.  You can undermine our security, but I'd think you wouldn't want to. -
[GTBacchus]: All that said, if you want to propose a move to [[Donostia-San Sebasti\xe1n]], I wouldn't oppose you. -
[GTBacchus]: No problem - I'm always especially happy to help out with Beatles articles! -
[GTBacchus]: I've deleted that; thanks for the heads-up. -
[GTBacchus]: It's ok; I can see deleted pages, too.  If I need 'em, I know where to find 'em. -
[GTBacchus]: That's taken care of; thanks for the heads-up.  I've blocked the account as apparently used only for vandalism, and deleted all the spurious image uploads.  Now it looks as if the user made ''no'' contributions, which I guess is just as well. -
[GTBacchus]: When it comes to IP addresses, it's hard to tag them as socks, because they don't necessarily stick to the same computer, and then we get collateral damage.  I notice that the IP in question is currently [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Special:Log&type=block&page=User:165.228.150.233 blocked] for 48 hours; maybe that will suffice.  I've watchlisted the talk page, too.  Let's see what happens. -
[GTBacchus]: I'm pretty familiar with the warning templates; thanks.  A cursory glance at my history would reveal that I've used several this evening.  I don't always use them.  When an IP with no prior history blanks a page, I'm pretty likely to skip it.  Anyway, thanks for being alert. -
[GTBacchus]: I've taken a couple of pictures of a pine tree near where I work in [[Mercer Island, Washington]].  I'm having trouble identifying the species.  If someone can help me figure out which type of pine it is, I'd be happy to add the images to that species' article.  Any tips on photographing trees would also be appreciated.  Thanks. -
[GTBacchus]: Maybe next year.  I think I'm not particularly trusted in some circles here, and I'd be surprised to make it, but running would be... educational. -
[GTBacchus]: This seems to be an error.  I clearly am not the one who uploaded that image.  I've left a note at the bot's talk page. -
[GTBacchus]: Please see my note at [[Talk:Rock Pigeon#National varieties of English]]. -
[GTBacchus]: Just as above, I have nothing to do with this image.  I reverted a piece of vandalism on the page months ago, and I know nor care nothing about its fair use rationale, or lack thereof. -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks again for being alert and helping look after our Columbiformes! -
[GTBacchus]: I don't know why I received this message, but I've deleted the redirect in question now. -
[GTBacchus]: I'm sorry, I don't know of any material about the Queen Mother of the West.  My only contribution to the page was to complete a move request, changing its title from Pinyin to English, and I did that because I was helping out with [[Wikipedia:requested moves|requested moves]], and not because of any expertise. <p> I wish you luck. -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks for the heads-up.  I've commented at the Tfd. -
[GTBacchus]: I didn't \""run and make a complaint\""; I still don't know what you're talking about. -
[GTBacchus]: My impression of you is only that you were inexperienced with policy editing, tried to make a few edits, and were surprised at the hornet's nest that WP policy editing is.  I'm really not fussed about details like where you set up a straw poll, and with what particular intention.  Much more important is whether people are learning from this experience. -
[GTBacchus]: Thank you for that explanation.  I hope the controversy dies down quickly. -
[GTBacchus]: In my conversations with Anarcho-capitalism, I've already suggested some more appropriate strategies for handling content disputes.  I agree that sock farms and sleeper accounts are a bad way to go about editing Wikipedia, and I'm not trying to unblock anybody who's going to use them.  My suggestion of unblocking Anarcho-capitalism is based on his agreeing to take a different approach. <p> Assuming we decide that Regulations is a separate person, I think it would be fair to leave that account blocked until we get some kind of agreement to edit according to good Wikipedia practices. -
[GTBacchus]: MastCell, I don't want you to think I'm assuming good faith to the point of foolishness.  I'm looking carefully at the evidence (there's a bit, and I haven't seen it all yet), and I'm not going to unblock the account if things don't add up right.  I actually had some dealings with RJII in the past, and I'm certainly not trying to unblock ''that'' user.  The communication I've had with Anarcho-capitalism indicates that he has some willingness to change his approach, but that has to be weighed against the evidence you're bringing up.  Stay tuned; we'll figure something out. <p> I thank you for the effort you've put into gathering and presenting evidence; it's very helpful. -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks for dropping by to say that.  There's no hard feelings from my end. -
[GTBacchus]: Duke's comments on that talk page will probably never be seen by the anonymous editor in question.  That IP has only made two edits to Wikipedia, both 10 days ago, and Duke left a note today.  That anon is long gone, and probably connected to a different IP address by now.  I'd let it lie. -
[GTBacchus]: No problem. -
[GTBacchus]: I appreciate your effort, but I think you don't understand my objection.  I use quite a bit of free software.  I'm aware that Windows is a terrible OS, and that there are better free ones out there.  I've used some of them.  We're not talking about my thinking that something is \""difficult\"", or \""fear of the unknown\"" here.  We're talking about a separate sociological problem, which is traditionally invisible to free software supporters, and which is why so many people think that you guys sound like you've been drinking the kool-aid.  It's good to know about, so read on. <p> The problem is that we're dealing with technophobic people, and with their comfort zones.  You don't get those people to listen to you by telling them that it's silly for them to be technophobic and suspicious of changes that they don't understand.  Now, we've got computers that were changed, from a familiar but suboptimal status quo, to something that is better in some ways (faster), but worse in others (some hacker's backgrounds, general stability questions, no possibility of customer support).  That change dragged some people out of their comfort zones. <p> If you want to sell an idea to someone who's been dragged out of their comfort zone, you don't lecture to them in a language they don't understand.  You don't move the goalposts still further, to something more removed from their comfort zone, and explain to them that it's better there.  You ''let them go back to their comfort zone'', and you talk to them when they're calm. <p> I'm perfectly happy to try out various free OS's on ''one'' of the work computers, and when I find one that will be easy to transition to, I start introducing it to people, and eventually they'll ''ask for it'' to be installed on the other machines.  Meanwhile, we've got three out of three machines screwed up, and we'd like to be able to revert to status quo before introducing more fundamental changes. <p> In the most crassly pragmatic sense, I'm unlikely to get approval to switch to a new OS right now, but if I can \""fix\"" the computers, and then introduce something new when we can see it in a better light, it's likely to be easy.  Salesman, know thy customer. -
[GTBacchus]: Interesting.  I said (a) that it isn't difficult, and (b) that I'm going to try out some free OS's.  Both of your questions are based on either not reading, not understanding, or not believing what I said. -
[GTBacchus]: Sorry, you're right; those weren't questions.  I was referring to your statements, \""you won't even give it a shot,\"" and, \""disprove that by trying it and telling me what is so difficult about it\"".  The first claim is simply false.  The second statement presupposes that I said installing a free OS was difficult; I did not.  Additionally, I never claimed that linux had no customer support, which you seem to think I said.  I was talking about the weird version of Windows that somebody installed on the computers at work. -
[GTBacchus]: Yeah, this thread continues from [[Wikipedia:Reference desk\/Computing#Removing images from hacked Windows installation|a thread]] at the reference desk, which provides context.  Sorry if I jumped on you unfairly for not knowing what was going on. -
[GTBacchus]: Ah, by \""hacker's backgrounds\"", I was referring to the background ''images'' put there by whoever put the Windows installation together.  Those are a liability of the new \""improved\"" Windows installation. -
[GTBacchus]: I've replied on your user page.  Please let me know if I can be of further assistance. -
[GTBacchus]: Oh dear.  I guess I supplied a third opinion without removing the request from the queue.  I didn't mean to cause any disruption, or get you yelled at.  Garnering increased involvement is a funny thing to be \""accused\"" of, because I generally think of that as a Good Thing.  If somebody doesn't like the 3O listing, then I guess a content RfC might be a better venue, as well as a few relevant talk pages (not user talk pages, per [[WP:CANVASS]]). -
[GTBacchus]: I'll have a look at the articles and let you know what I think.  It's likely to be a day or two before I have time. -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks for dropping me a note.  I've been very busy, and not logged on much lately, but I've made some comments at [[WT:IAR]]. -
[GTBacchus]: A sadist considers enjoying the pain of others to be a good; otherwise they wouldn't pursue it.  Everyone pursues their understanding of the good.  Plato made this clear, I believe it was in the [[Phaedrus (Plato)|Phaedrus]]. -
[GTBacchus]: I think it's absurd.  I've been in IRC with both of them at once.  They're different people with different personalities, different priorities, etc.  I'd like to see what evidence there is for them being one and the same. -
[GTBacchus]: Like I said at ArbCom, if Miltopia is Blu Aardvark, then so am I.  (Maybe [[I'm Spartacus]], too, while we're at it.)  I do recall interacting with Samsara at ED in the past.  He seemed to be an interesting chap, but I don't think we saw eye to eye.  Maybe he's Spartacus, too. -
[GTBacchus]: Thank you very much! -
[GTBacchus]: Moving the other articles and templates doesn't sound like so much trouble.  Of course they'll need to move to follow the main article.  I'll start working on that now. -
[GTBacchus]: It's no problem.  Thank ''you'' for engaging in a [[WP:CALM|calm]] manner; that always helps. -
[GTBacchus]: You're welcome - I remember being quite puzzled when I first came across similar situations. -
[GTBacchus]: I think they're all moved; please let me know if there are any we missed that need admin buttons to move. -
[GTBacchus]: That's fixed now.  Thanks for pointing it out. -
[GTBacchus]: You seem to already have it at [[User:IDNexpert\/Social Parking]]. -
[GTBacchus]: I deleted it per the discussion at [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\/Fight Fire with Fire]].  Please let me know if you have any further questions. -
[GTBacchus]: Yeah, I'm a big fan of the old-school comics; web comics just aren't the same.  As far as Wikipedia rules, I find that I'm happier when I don't expect them to be consistent.  They're more like adages: \""Haste makes waste,\"" but, \""He who hesitates is lost\"".  They contradict each other, but people don't really worry about it.  It's not like mathematics or logic, where consistency is a big priority.  Anyway, happy editing! -
[GTBacchus]: Hi, Akhilleus.  I was just working on the backlog at [[Wikipedia:Requested moves]], and I moved [[Paula Campbell (singer)]] to [[Paula Campbell]].  After moving the page, I noticed that the article had gone through an AfD in June, [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\/Paula Campbell (singer)|here]].  You closed the AfD as a delete, but it doesn't seem the page was ever deleted (unless I'm missing something).  Do you know what happened there? -
[GTBacchus]: No problem; happy editing! -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks for explaining that.  I see now that I missed it because there aren't any deleted edits there, so I assumed it had not been deleted.  I also have no opinion on the page's existence; I'll look into the subject's notability, and if it seems appropriate, I'll send it back to AfD, or just re-delete it.  Thanks again. -
[GTBacchus]: I gotta say, I'm not sure what you're saying, nor why you're saying it to me.  I don't seem to have edited [[Johnny Kidd]], or any of the pages linked from there. -
[GTBacchus]: Ok.  I've added a comment to [[Talk:Positional good]] suggesting that anybody supporting the other title give some reasons.  Thanks for the heads-up. -
[GTBacchus]: Got a link? -
[GTBacchus]: Sure, I could undelete a version to my [[User:GTBacchus\/sandbox|sandbox]] for a while.  Please let me know when you've seen what you need to see, or if you'd like to see more of its history.  It has 20 versions in the history, going back to April 2006. -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks for dropping by. <p> I replied to that one post at NPA, in the interest of not breaking up the train of thought.  If my reply seems inappropriate there, or if it seems desirable to develop that angle any further, you're certainly welcome to be refactor it to this page. <p> I'm quite happy for the conversation to move to [[WT:BADLINKS]], insofar as it involves proposals for new policy, and to our user talk pages, insofar as it involves more personal subjects, such as our various avatars and intentions.  [[WT:NPA]] has seen enough turmoil for a few months, I reckon. -
[GTBacchus]: No, due to other additions to my talk page, I actually didn't notice this section until now.  Please give me a few hours to sleep and deal with this issue tomorrow.  I'm sorry for the delay, and I thank you for your patience. -
[GTBacchus]: How many wrongs does it take to make a right, do you figure? -
[GTBacchus]: What kind of hair is this to split?  Is it really the point whether your incivility was a 4 or a 7 on a scale of 1 to Dick?  I consider blatantly disrespectful statements to be an act of violence against the dignity and decorum that we try to maintain.  \""Going off\"" on someone like that is aggressive and, in a way, violent.  Slander (referring to an \""anti-MONGO agenda\""... what?) is also a form of violence against someone's good name. However, this is so far from being the point I feel silly talking about it. <p> The point is whether or not you're treating others excellently.  If you wish to quibble, then I will cheerfully retract the word \""violent\"", even though I don't really think that throwing accusations and insults around is less unacceptable than throwing fists around.  But let's take it away; perhaps my view is off-kilter or just wrong. <p> There remains the fact that your reaction to being called out for incivility is to argue with the criticism rather than trying to set anything right.  Am I supposed to be impressed by that?  If you have an issue with what those two were saying, why not present it as a rational, constructive criticism, rather than as accusations with vulgarities attached?  Even better, why not address the actual points being made, and show by example what it's like to have a mature discussion?  I'm not saying their... banter was helpful or productive, but your reaction to it seems particularly inappropriate.  The best reaction to immature behavior is to ''rise above it''. -
[GTBacchus]: No problem. :) -
[GTBacchus]: So... how many wrongs is that?  How many rude remarks equal one civil, respectful one?  What's bad about stating criticism in a civil, mature, rational way, setting an example for the rest of us?  Why not aim for excellence?   Or are your remarks above your idea of treating others excellently? -
[GTBacchus]: Joshua, thanks for your advice.  However, I gave up my anonymity long ago.  I posted my name in our facebook quite a while back (see below), and for quite some time, my user page linked back to my old userpage at [[h2g2]], where my real name has been posted for years.  I'm really not worried about it.  The point you make about encouraging others to do the same is more of a concern, but I don't really see how my name being posted is a suggestion that anybody else do the same.  Maybe I'll add footnote to that effect. -
[GTBacchus]: ThuranX, I'm not worried about those attack sites listing me. What if they post my name and [[Wikipedia:Facebook#G|photograph]]? Actually, looking at that page with my photo, my real name has been there for months, and it hasn't caused me any trouble yet. They could have listed me long ago, but despite watching \""like hawks\"", they haven't. (Maybe I don't look to them like hawk-food?) I'm not listed on hivemind; and I'm not sure why. <p> More to the point, '''I'm not arguing for outing sites in any way, shape or form'''. Your reading comprehension skills seem a bit off. Your arrogant insistence that you know my mind better than I know it myself is silly. I'm arguing for more effective protection than you're arguing for. As far as I can tell, you're more pro-outing sites than I am. To be very clear, I'm not aware of ''any situation'' where it would be appropriate to link to any outing site from Wikipedia, and I'm prepared to put my money where my mouth is.  Have you ever blocked a troll or harasser for posting personal information, and deleted that information?  I have. <p> Thanks for your concern all the same. -
[GTBacchus]: ThuranX, keep digging.  You clearly know a ''whole'' lot about JoshuaZ.  Yeah.  The more you talk, the less you annoy me and the more you amuse me. -
[GTBacchus]: I dunno, that's kind of a personal question....  ;) <p> I teach at a little private school; we work with different ages.  My youngest student is a seventh grader doing prealgebra, and I've got a handful on Seniors learning calculus.  I used to teach at university; [http:\/\/www.mth.pdx.edu\/people\/faculty_page.asp?id=224 check it out]. -
[GTBacchus]: Hi.  My talk page has been busy this evening, and I missed this for a while.  I'm sorry for going off on you like that; I try not to jump to conclusions about people.  When I do jump, I tend to be wrong; go figure. <p> I don't want to dismiss your concerns, and we do seem to be coming from very different places, so let's take it slowly.  Let's talk about vandalism.  We haven't got an acid test for it.  Vandalism is \""any edit made in a deliberate attempt to compromise the quality of the encyclopedia,\"" or something to that effect.  Naturally, we can't tell what somebody's thinking, but we revert vandalism all the time, and we rely on each editor and admin to use their judgment to do so.  In that sense, the rules are \""all in the administrators' minds\"".  This is even more true with blocking, which is an arena where admins are given wide latitude to apply a fairly simply blocking policy to a variety of situations.  Despite these going on for all of Wikipedia's history, neither the way we deal with vandalism, nor the way we deal with blocking, has led to any kind of dystopian nightmare.  Both pop up regularly on [[WP:ANI|ANI]], sometimes due to bad judgment by admins, and we deal with it, every time, as a group. <p> Now, what you say about people trying to control Wikipedia's content is true.  Anyone with an agenda to push would be a fool not to push it here.  However, there are people here representing every agenda on the planet.  They're all here, so no particular one is dominant.  There are certainly cliques that control particular articles, but they're small, and Wikipedia is vast.  They also don't last forever, and in the long run, that's a sure bet. <p> You mention Wikipedia's power structure... we ''kind of'' have one.  We're kind of a combination of dictatorship, anarchy, democracy, oligarchy, meritocracy and commune.  Nobody's in charge of this asylum but the inmates.  Jimbo's smart enough (or maybe just busy enough) to stay the hell away most of the time. <p> Now what we're really talking about is how to handle links to possible harassment, and I think you're putting a lot of weight on something I said about emailing particularly sensitive links to ArbCom or someone for private review.  I guess the idea is that we could get potentially damaging material off-wiki while reviewing it.  It was certainly a one-off comment, that I had put very little weight on, so please don't think that it's somehow representative of my views. <p> As I think about it now, it occurs to me that a good way to review a link would be to delete, but not oversight it, so the admins can see it, and then let them discuss what they see on [[WP:AN|AN]] or [[WP:ANI|ANI]].  That makes the process of making a decision transparent, without revealing all of the (presumably dangerous) information under the link.  That's actually not too far from the status quo, come to think of it. <p> A nice thing about that is that admins bring a wide variety of perspectives, attitudes, beliefs, etc.  They won't all agree that something is a deletable link except in cases where it clearly is.  The gray area cases will be few and far between, and we would have to deal with those on a case-by-case basis no matter what rule we write down - there will always be a gray area. <p> Now, a plan like this does ''not'' obviate the possibility of some admin or small group of admins getting it into their head that they're right about something, that no one else understands, and that they're going to wheel war over it.  However, that sort of thing, like shit, happens.  No amount of planning will stop those from sometimes happening.  When there's some kind of high-drama situation like that (whether brought about by an \""outing\"" site incident or otherwise), people are breaking \""rules\"" left and right.  In that shitstorm, having a directly applicable sentence on the right policy page isn't going to change anything, except possibly which names the participants call each other. <p> Those are situations that involve personalities, and part of what we're blessed with here at Wikipedia is a menagerie of personalities.  I assume we're all mostly insane (except, of course, anybody who would take offense if I said that about them).  Some personalities and combinations of personalities tend to create and\/or facilitate some ridiculous situations, and this is one of them.  This too will pass. <p> You know, I was here during the userbox wars.  Do you know about those?  It was the first half of '06, and a lot of it took place on and around [[Wikipedia:deletion review|deletion review]].  It was a controversial wiki-drama, involving some very strong personalities, lots of venom, and mostly situations for which we already had applicable rules.  People just ignored them, because we have [[WP:IAR|a rule saying you can do that]], or for what ever reason they thought of at the time. <p> The only power our rules derive is that of being backed by consensus, because what's written on the policy page isn't a magic formula that forces our hands, preventing us from doing things we might later regret.  We do stupid things anyway. We're simply going to have to handle gray areas and intransigent users from time to time, no matter what we write anywhere. When those situations arise, we'll deal with them, and it won't be just a few people pulling strings, it will be all of us interacting in good faith, but with limited information, limited empathy, and limited communication skills. <p> Whatever administrator pissed in your cornflakes the other day has limited power, and if they really do abuse their power, they may very well be de-sysoped.  It's not so rare.  During the userbox wars I had conversations with people in which they were insisting about the need for clear rules to control such-and-such admin who had power and was clearly entrenched and popular and untouchable.  At the time, I argued against this myth of the all-powerful admin, and my arguments were poo-poohed as a naively optimistic failure to realize that the haves are in charge, and determined to hold the have-nots down, and that some kind of rule had to be written to rein them it.  The wars were finally resolved elegantly, with no need for new policy (although some pages ''did'' get written, including some good ones!).  The most reckless admins involved are no longer admins, and the reckless ones who are still admins have changed their tune considerably. <p> We'll get past this one, too.  ArbCom's rulings in the current case, [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration\/Attack sites]] should set a tone, and we'll get to see how the melody unfurls from there.  It's inevitable that neither side will get everything they want, and that the sheer [[Brownian motion]] of countless edits will nudge us to some place in the middle. <p> If all else fails - and I'm definitely serious about that part - come get me.  I can sometimes help, and I'll certainly try.  Try not to worry too much about how potentially damaging links will be reviewed.  It won't be entirely private, and it won't be entirely public, because we'll insist on both.  Even better, we'll insist on a whole continuum, and we'll keep our eyes on each other all along it.  That is the way the wiki works. -
[GTBacchus]: Would I mind?  I'm pretty sure I insist!  You can't out me though; I beat you to it.  I've already admitted I'm a furr- oops, I just took care of sexual humiliation, too.  If you ask ArbCom what that means, they could answer you with a link to ED, except they really couldn't... you know, post that link. <p> I too hope that ArbCom's decision will help with the current drama.  It's interesting, what they said and what they didn't say.  I've not yet suggested any solutions of my own, only tried to reassure people that we're all cool, we're all little [[Fonzie]]s.  Tonight, I've surprised myself by maybe thinking of something; I'll try to post it tomorrow when I'm not falling asleep at the keyboard. <p> See ya. -
[GTBacchus]: Ok, keep arguing then.  You're right to reply to immaturity with immaturity.  If two wrongs don't make a right, then maybe seven or eight will. <p> I was happy enough just to say, \""hey, let's not make comments like that,\"" but you want to go seven rounds over it.  Fine.  You win.  Enjoy it. -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks for your input; I'll take that under advisement.  Maybe I'll start throwing my weight around and acting like more of an asshole.  Heavy-handedness is so much better than diplomacy (which I admit I fail at regularly, but keep trying).  I've not observed that more blocking leads to less talk page incivility, but I'm sure you're right.  Thanks! -
[GTBacchus]: Yeah, I'm going to stick with my usual position, of trying to convince everyone to treat each other excellently, to choose peace over retaliation, and to stop assuming that other people are some kind of scum or idiots just because they disagree with someone.  It's a dirty job, but someone's gotta do it. -
[GTBacchus]: I sure as hell haven't assumed that you're any kind of scum, ever.  I don't think there exist people who are anything other than children of God, with all that such a position entails.  Did I accuse you of edit warring?  No.  Did I accuse you of being chronically uncivil?  No.  Do I believe that you are an edit warrior or a chronically uncivil editor?  No.  Don't you dare tell me what kind of assumptions I've made about you - you have no idea what I assume. <p> What I saw was you responding to one isolated situation in a way that was rude and out of proportion, on a page that really needs de-escalation, and not escalation.  I left a very politely worded warning on your talk page, and I said on the page in question, \""can we please not make comments like that?\""  Rather than simply saying, \""yeah, that was out of line,\"" you chose to cavil over it.  That pushed a button on me, it turns out, because I, being human, have got buttons.  Somehow between the two of us, we managed to keep escalating, and I ended up being a dick.  I'm sorry.  I screwed up. <p> As far as I know, that one incident was the only time you've ever been uncivil with anyone.  I don't think you reacted well to my initial comments, and I didn't react well to your reaction.  We're both human.  I will endeavor to learn from this experience, so I thank you for the lesson. -
[GTBacchus]: You guys are welcome to take this elsewhere. -
[GTBacchus]: I have restored the material to [[User:GTBacchus\/sandbox]]; please let me know when you've got whatever you need from it. -
[GTBacchus]: The thread is deleted from JzG's page, so I guess I'll reply here to something you said.  I think that, the more Wikipedians act like cops, the more we inflame situations and provoke more trolling.  The less we act like authority figures, the less drama there is.  The most cop-like admins tend also to be the most controversial, and controversy is bad for the project.  As encyclopedia writers, our job is to avoid things, such as drama and controversy, that distract from the task at hand.  You may think of some editors as \""bad guys\"", but making it clear that you think that they're \""bad guys\"" and you're a \""good guy\"" tends to lead to escalation of conflict. <p> The more effective approach is to be very, very boring, to never talk about anybody's personal motivations, and to simply apply sound editorial judgment and insist that we talk about that, and not about personalities.  As KilerChihuahua used to say, that's one puppy's opinion... -
[GTBacchus]: I really don't know much about uploading pictures, but I can try to find the answer to your question.  I probably won't get to it tonight, though, because I'm about to go out [[bowling]]. -
[GTBacchus]: (Note to self - start referring to competing points of view as \""irrelevant doublespeak\"" - mustn't miss a chance to complete a self-reference loop like that!  It's like drinking a glass of water while peeing - one of those moments when things line up and the true nature of reality shines through.) -
[GTBacchus]: I've completed its [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\/Black Merda (2nd nomination)|second AfD nomination]]; let's see what the community decides about this rewritten version. -
[GTBacchus]: MONGO, I hope I can convince you that I'm not \""missing your point\"", and perhaps explain why this thread is here.  I understand what you're saying: people who are here to cause disruption need to go.  My point is about ''how'' this is done.  You basically have two options: You can call a spade a spade, make it clear that you think the person's a troll, and block them accordingly.  Alternatively, you can simply enforce encyclopedic standards, without ever mentioning what you think the person's motivations are.  One option tends to increase drama; the other tends to decrease it. <p> The reason I'm posting here is that I think it's important to understand that the high-drama option, although clearly ''intended'' to serve the encyclopedia, has the unintended consequence of feeding trolls.  \""Calling a spade a spade\"" creates drama, and hurts the project.  \""Showing someone the door\"" in a heavy-handed manner breeds more trolls.  Don't help trolls breed.  Starve them out by being incredibly boring, never calling them trolls, and never talking about motivations.  You can call it \""babysitting\"", but I'm just talking about doing '''exactly what you are talking about''', but effectively, instead of counter-productively.  Think about it. <p> As for \""''I have yet to see any rationale that explains how our ability to be a comprehensive encyclopedia is compromised by not linking to websites that are fail RS and are primarily used to stalk, harass and to coordinate efforts to \""go after\"" our contributors.''\"" - neither have I.  Neither I nor Alec is arguing that we should be linking to those sites.  Go look at [[Talk:Criticism of Wikipedia]], where JzG created heat and drama by removing the link without following sound editing practices, and where I have tried to demonstrate that the way to change content is by ''refusing'' to do anything other than talk about boring policy, which is applied one link at a time, for purely encyclopedic reasons.  '''That''' is how you get links removed. <p> Talking about personalities is gasoline; use water instead. -
[GTBacchus]: You're clearly not a teacher.  You think you know \""the best way to get rid of them\"", but you know the best way to feed them, and I have the diffs to prove it.  Karwynn is an example of a troll that you were dead set on feeding and I made go away by dealing with them effectively instead of the way you do it.  I know more about how not to feed trolls than you do.  I have the diffs to prove it. -
[GTBacchus]: MONGO... man, dude, sir, the best way not to feed them is to show clearly that you consider them children of God, and therefore aspects of God, on every level that could possibly matter, and I'm not \""kidding\"", nor less than emphatic on ''any'' level about that.  I consider you to be an aspect of [[God]].  Think about that. -
[GTBacchus]: You didn't assume good faith; you assumed I was on a mass link deletion spree. -
[GTBacchus]: It doesn't matter whether that section appears or disappears on that policy page; links of no encyclopedic value may be removed, because this is an encyclopedia, and not a soapbox or a soap opera. If somebody persists in adding valueless content, then they're being disruptive, and may be blocked accordingly. The trick is to do it all without once mentioning anyone's motives. Then it's a simple matter of \""sound editorial judgment,\"" and nobody has to get in the mud.  AGF 'em to death. -
[GTBacchus]: I feel that my job in closing moves is to read consensus.  That includes taking into account comments made in that particular discussion, as well as larger-scale consensus for established guidelines such as [[WP:COMMONNAME]].  When I closed the discussion, I could not claim that a clear consensus was displayed in the conversation, so I felt is was appropriate to cite the consensus-supported precedents that are relevant. <p> I'm sorry you thought my comments were inappropriate.  Although it may have come across as my personal opinion, I was actually just trying to restate the arguments in favor of the move.  I don't personally have any feelings on the matter; I didn't mean to come across that way. -
[GTBacchus]: ...about admins assuming good faith of each other. Could I request a bit of that from you, please? I have not said a single word EXCEPT in support of you and of Wikipedia. When will you stop accusing me of doing otherwise? -
[GTBacchus]: I'm not saying it ''was'' directed at anyone in particular. I'm just saying that I'd appreciate if you refrain from suggesting that I'm supporting people whom I'm not supporting. That seems to me to be counter to the idea of [[WP:AGF|AGF]]. If I mistook your reply to me, and you don't actually think I'm supporting trolling behavior, then I apologize for my misunderstanding. -
[GTBacchus]: [[Instant Karma]], buddy. Congratulations on your edits, and on deciding that you found something wrong with one of mine.  Congratulations on creating a holier-than-thou sermon (thanks for the links, by the way!), about why I shouldn't give holier-than-thou sermons. Mostly, thanks for appreciating the work I do here. Happy editing! -
[GTBacchus]: I've replied by email. I disagree with much of what you've said, and agree with a lot for the \""wrong\"" reasons, but I think we're understanding each other better than ever. -
[GTBacchus]: Who said he's anonymous to me? What do you know about what I know? Have a nice day. <p> Good work again on Ph\xe8dre. -
[GTBacchus]: I just replied to you at [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard\/Incidents\/My desysop of Zscout370]], and I've got to say... are you serious? Do you honestly believe that I am trying to abet harassment, or not? If not, why on Earth would you need to ask such questions? If you assume good faith from me, why not act like it? I have never, ever, suggested that you would intentionally abet harassment, or refrain from reporting abuse when you see it; why do you suggest those things of me? I feel hurt by your post over there. I thought we were understanding each other a bit. -
[GTBacchus]: First of all, that is '''not''' the question you asked me. The question you asked me was whether or not I would help with a sock check. I am offended that you find that question to be worth asking. It should be utterly obvious that I would do so, in a heartbeat. If you understood me at all, that would be clear to you. You would also realize that, in such an event, I would be emailing Miltopia, trying to persuade him not to disrupt Wikipedia. <p> In that thread, I was replying to what someone said. If someone thinks IP addresses are hard to come by, they might as well find out sometime that they're wrong. We might as well all know the reality, that IP addresses are easy to change, and we might as well face that reality with our eyes open. <p> If your question was an honest one, it seems to indicate that you don't think I'm acting in good faith. (If I'm wrong, then please forgive me, but please explain.) If you know that I'm working for the good of Wikipedia, why would you doubt for a minute whether I would help prevent someone working around a block? Do you seriously believe (a) that I would help Miltopia evade a block, and (b) that I would do it by posting in public when I could obviously just email him? I'm certain he knows far more about changing IP addresses than I ever will. <p> I mean, are you thinking about where I'm coming from, at all? If so, then why should I believe you, when you said you assume good faith from me? How can you assume that I'm acting in good faith, and that I'd turn around and undermine our project? You can trust that ''I mean every word I say'', such as \""I support the block of Miltopia.\"" This is like a recurring theme with us, MONGO. I'm not working against Wikipedia, no matter how you cut it. I am your loyal supporter, and always will be - you may count on that. <p> I have been playing the very same tune this whole time. It goes \""never, ever, ever, ever, ever make ad hominem comments. They're unhelpful, unnecessary, and unprofessional; they feed trolls.\"" This is pretty much the only thing I've ever said to you, over and over again, for like a year now. In that time, you have accused me of saying a myriad of other absurdities (and never apologized for a single mischaracterization of my actions or words). When will you acknowledge that you hear my message, and not some nonsense that I would never say in a million years? -
[GTBacchus]: Well, at least we're talking in clearer terms now. You think my approach is \""weak\"", and I think your approach is \""heavy handed\"". My approach is based on cause and effect. I see that the heavy-handed approach causes at least as much harm as it prevents. You \""can't understand why I didn't block Karwynn\"".  It's because blocking someone is a bad idea (drama-positive) when you can use words to neutralize their actions (drama-negative) instead. <p> Frankly, I don't care whether you assume good faith of others. You can judge people to your heart's content, as long as you keep your judgment to yourself. As soon as you start talking about another person's motivations, you're hurting the project, period. This is true no matter how much of a shit they are, and no matter how much you think they need to be \""called a spade\"". Calling spades hurts us, every time. <p> As for the history with Karwynn, when I said I have the diffs to prove it, I meant it. Your interpretation is incorrect. I'm talking about a very specific interaction that went like this: Tony Sidaway said something to Karwynn, Karwynn talked back... you said something to Karwynn, Karwynn kept talking back... Tony and you took turns failing to make Karwynn go away. I showed up and said a few words, and Karwynn ''actually went away''. You two were giving Karwynn sandwich after sandwich, and I said, \""restaurant's closed\"". A block is ''not'' the best way to do it when you can do it with words. Trolling can be stopped in its tracks with well-chosen words. <p> You think I'm \""trying to reform\"" \""trolls\"". No. I'm talking to human beings, because we have no choice. The world is too small to think there's \""us\"" and \""them\"". We're all in it together, like it or not. You can either set up an adversarial relationship, or some other kind. One leads to more drama, the other doesn't. Simple cause and effect. -
[GTBacchus]: Take care, MONGO; you have my support. My approach was never tested in the long run, because there were too many people committed to the heavy-handed approach. Until my way is tested, you can't say whether or not it works. I know that some people know that my approach does work, and [[Albert Einstein|I]] [[Leo Tolstoy|trust]] [[Mahatma Gandhi|them]] [[Gautama Buddha|a]] [[Jesus|lot]]. -
[GTBacchus]: Crockspot, maybe we should move this from MONGO's talk page. I don't wish to bother him, but I disagree with you on several points. First off, your interpretation of events is by no means the only possible take on what happened. For example, \""Jimbo had to ban Miltopia himself.\"" That is an extremely dubious assertion. Jimbo did what he did, and he didn't do it in the best possible way, and the drama-fest was caused entirely by people being unable to refrain from ''ad hominem'' remarks. The drama-fest could have been avoided if we adopted some basic standards of professionalism at Wikipedia. All of the drama is caused by people thinking that spades need to be called spades, aloud and in public. <p> I'll note that neither you nor MONGO has made a case that adding insult to injury is somehow necessary. My '''central thesis''' - the '''only point I care about''' - is that ''ad hominem'' comments are '''always''' unnecessary, unhelpful, unprofessional, and tend to raise heat. Nobody has argued that calling someone a \""troll\"" or calling their edits \""bad faith\"" is in any way necessary. We can block and ban without ever name-calling - so why name-call? <p> Next, you're making questionable assumptions about people whom you clearly do not understand. \""They are professionals in the art of trollery.\"" That's nonsense. Do you know these people? I do. Miltopia is the age and disposition of many students that I've worked with. Miltopia is not a professional troll, nor is he necessarily a committed non-troll. He is (was?) wide open to influences. He gave Wikipedia a chance, and if we hadn't called him names at every turn, and read bad-faith into everything he did, he would have left his trolling ways behind. You can't say I'm wrong, because we ''never even tried it''. We had a chance to make Miltopia into a Wikipedian, and we lost it. We amused him with our absurdity more than we impressed him with our professionalism, so now he's laughing at our circus, and who can blame him? <p> Some claim that because he's laughing now, that proves that he had bad faith. What rubbish. If you throw someone out because you suspect they're against you, and then after you throw them out, they're against you... that doesn't prove that they ''were'' against you until you went and threw them out!. <p> You say \""trolls are here to troll\"". That may be, but my point is '''never call somebody a troll'''. Doing so makes things worse. Nobody has argued, nor can argue, that name-calling is ever helpful. -
[GTBacchus]: MONGO, you're still missing (ignoring?) my main point. I'll say it again: \""There is never any excuse for ''ad hominem'' remarks. They are unnecessary, unprofessional and unhelpful.\"" You seem to have dedided to make sense of me in terms of my \""trying to reform problematic editors\"". That indicates that you don't understand where I'm coming from, but I'm comfortable with that, as long as you hear the one, single important point I've been making. I'd like to reply to something else you said, but I can't because then you'll continue to ignore the one point I truly care about. No personal remarks. Ever. Try it. -
[GTBacchus]: You're still making ''ad hominem'' remarks, and nothing will ever make those useful, helpful, productive, or professional. This is the most important point I can make. <p> Utterly independent of that point is Miltopia's behavior over at WR. '''Of course he's talking trash about us there; we just threw him out of here.''' If Miltopia is a professional troll, then it's because we made him into one. He wasn't a professional troll one week ago, and now if he is '''who can blame him'''? <p> More importantly, and please don't miss this point: IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT ANYBODY'S INTENTIONS ARE; WE HAVE NO BUSINESS TALKING ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE'S INTENTIONS, EVER. If that is the only point I make in this life, I'm satisfied. \""Judge not.\"" Take it seriously. -
[GTBacchus]: I think I can be a little clearer than I have been so far... here goes. <p> MONGO, you seem intent that I'm \""trying to reform\"" people. That's way off-target. I'm not here to reform people, I'm here to help build an encyclopedia. If somebody gets reformed as a side-effect, super. If nobody gets reformed, then oh well. The encyclopedia is the ''only'' priority here. Perhaps we agree on that point. <p> Now, this may come as a surprise to you, but I want to see the same people blocked that you want to see blocked. I just want it done for clean reasons, because otherwise we're hurting ourselves. \""Clean\"", in this context, means utterly untainted by any kind of personal aspersions being cast. No name-calling, no \""spades\"", no funny stuff. By the book. They didn't bust Al Capone by wringing their hands about how evil he was; they busted him on tax evasion. What could be more boring than that? That's the right way to build a 'pedia. <p> The ED article is another example. The trick to deleting that was to do it by the book. If we deleted it because we found it abhorrent, then it would keep popping up again, forever, because people looking over the backstory would see invalid reasons for deletion, and question them. Now, people looking at the history actually see very boring policy reasons being quoted: stuff about reliable sources and blah, blah, blah. No drama there. <p> Now hear this: I'm not talking about reforming anybody. I'm saying that if you taint our editorial decisions by making a lot of noise about personal crap, then you are hurting the integrity of the project. We cannot do things for reasons of personal moral outrage, ever. If we do, we get drama for the rest of our lives. If we are boring instead, the drama will evaporate. Try it. -
[GTBacchus]: Thank you; that's very kind. It gets a bit stressful in there, and it's not that pretty at all. I think that we're learning as a community, and I hope that I'm at least pushing in some of the right directions. I guess we hope that, if enough people are pushing with good faith, then we'll all average out to some kind of slow progress in the right direction. Take care, -
[GTBacchus]: Hmm. It appears that it may be the same person. However, as [[User:Saguy1982|Saguy1982]], they don't seem to be editing disruptively. Seeing that the older account is not banned, and the current account not breaking rules, I don't think you can get much traction out of possible sock-puppetry. I'd be willing to help mediate the related ''content'' dispute - I've added [[Visual kei]] and [[Dir en grey]] to my watchlist. If it's a matter of edit-warring or editing against consensus, then we should be able to work it out without having to talk about past accounts. If the new account starts editing disruptively, then we'll be ready to deal with that. <p> Does that sound to you like a reasonable option? -
[GTBacchus]: Hi, I only just now noticed this section - sometimes the talk page gets away from me. Thank you for reading my essay, and for the link to yours. I think what you've written is very true, and that you've articulated the idea well. Have you thought of advertising it at the [[WP:VP\/P|Village Pump]], or [[Wikipedia talk:Civility]]? -
[GTBacchus]: Thank you! -
[GTBacchus]: Yes, he seems to have some peculiar ideas about what project we should be pursuing here. Eventually, he'll either decide to be a part of ''this'' project, or he'll leave, I suppose. I don't think Wikipedia is going to start including original research just because some people would like for it to. At that point, what would distinguish Wikipedia from the rest of the Internet? That's what I'd like to know. -
[GTBacchus]: That sounds good. Please let me know if I can be of assistance. -
[GTBacchus]: Cyrus, I'm a bit busy, and can't watch the page as actively as I might otherwise. Please do let me know if a situation arises while I'm looking elsewhere, and I'll be sure to drop by and comment. Thanks. -
[GTBacchus]: First of all, I don't know anything about [[WP:SPP]]. I don't know why an attempt to verify that the two accounts are the same user would \""backfire\"", but I also don't see much point in it. I tend to think that the most effective strategy is to insist that each dispute be treated as a content dispute alone, unless it becomes absolutely necessary to talk about editors as persons. Otherwise, the personal line of argument tends to distract from the encyclopedic one. That's just my opinion, of course. -
[GTBacchus]: The shortcut [[WP:NOSPADE]] works. Thanks for the heads-up. -
[GTBacchus]: Rude? Hah! I'll have to reply more thoroughly tomorrow, but I'll say for now that you can \""crash my page\"" anytime you like, whatever that ends up meaning. -
[GTBacchus]: I didn't accuse you of breaking any \""rules\"", and I certainly don't understand why it's necessary to call anybody a \""bigot\"", in that context or any other. As to name-changes in other countries, they are irrelevant insofar as we're following [[WP:COMMONNAME]], which is a strongly supported guideline. \""Iran\"" is more common in modern, reliable, English-language sources than \""Persia\"" is. \""Burkina Faso\"" is more common than \""Upper Volta\"". \""C\xf4te d'Ivoire\"" is more common than \""Ivory Coast\"". \""Thailand\"" is more common than \""Siam\"". The question is not whether other countries' name changes have become dominant in usage; the question is whether Burma's name change has. -
[GTBacchus]: I'm actually about to be offline for a few hours, but I can have a look when I get back. -
[GTBacchus]: No worries. I don't suppose you're going around calling people names; I was just reacting to the wording of that one comment. Cheers. -
[GTBacchus]: I'm sorry that you're disappointed. I would point out that I apply very different standards to article space and to user space. I think our goal in article space is neutrality, no matter what people may think of it. I would never base article-space decisions on what is likely to offend people. On other pages, however, we're presenting the human face of Wikipedia, and I would be disappointed if our human face is one with the attitude, \""I don't care whether I offend you or not\"". \""On-wiki\"", for me, is not one homogeneous place. The article pages are the encyclopedia, and the other pages are backstage, and I make very different edits in one space than I would in the other. <p> I've been to London plenty of times - I think I would count it as my favorite city in the world - and it's very, very different from the third world. When I used to flee from Kenya to England and regain my sense of equilibrium, it was very clear to me which place was part of my world and which one was not. -
[GTBacchus]: Hi. I feel that I must have given the wrong impression at [[WP:AN\/I]]. I've replied there to your thoughtful, considered post, and I hope my response clarifies where I'm coming from. I'm sorry that what I've said has rubbed you the wrong way, as I suspect that our beliefs are in fact rather similar. If you don't wish to continue the conversation at ANI, please feel free to reply further either here or at my talk page. -
[GTBacchus]: I would be happy if we had some kind of understanding on this issue... I'm thinking quite seriously about your position, and as I indicated at AN\/I, I think that taboos are extremely harmful, and I oppose them regularly - you could ask my real-life friends about this. It's kind of a hobby-horse of mine. Thus, I would be quite upset if I were working to reinforce the very mindset that I abhor. <p> However... I'm not convinced that you've chosen the right hill on which to fight this battle. The best way to challenge people's superstitious ideas is in the articles. It is vitally important that we have frank, direct, unapologetic articles about such topics as [[female genital cutting]] and other forms of sexual oppression and violence. There can be no compromise on that point. Casual use of vulgar language, however, isn't going to set things right in the world. What it might do is alienate someone whom it would be better to keep as an audience, because they're the ones who really need to learn. \""Give us your fucking money\"" isn't combating superstition or helping any oppressed person. It's not ending sexual violence. Our articles have the potential to do precisely that. <p> My attitude is that we must be absolutely neutral and uncensored in our articles, and absolutely kind, inclusive and respectful when it comes to how we maintain the \""atmosphere\"" at Wikipedia. \""Give us your fucking money\"" is kind of cute, in a fairly sophomoric way. It doesn't set the scene for actually helping teach superstitious people to be more open-minded. We should display the most class we possibly can, and thus reflect as respectably as possible onto the encyclopedia, and thus help convince people of the seriousness and nobility of our mission here. <p> So, you see, my goal is ''not'' to kowtow to a taboo; it's to create an atmosphere in which someone will stick around and learn something that directly and intelligently challenges their taboos. A dignified article about the word \""fuck\"" will do that. Crassness won't. I'm not ''refraining'' from saying \""fuck\""; I just find that I can get the job done better with other words. -
[GTBacchus]: I'm not ignoring this issue, but I'm rather busy off-wiki at the moment. I promise to have a look at this as soon as I can. I'm sorry for the delay. -
[GTBacchus]: ...and yet it's been removed by another for being non-notable, and essentially an ad. -
[GTBacchus]: What do you thihk? The worst I can do is fail to live up to my word, and then we'll be right back where we are now. On the other hand, you might find out how effective we can be when we handle these situations right, and not wrong. Why not give it a try? -
[GTBacchus]: Yes, there is a reason, and I've told it to you dozens of times. I oppose advertising the existence of these sites. I oppose BEANS. I oppose the policy that you're trying to shoehorn into [[WP:NPA]] because I think it's misguided, and every time I've told you this, you've responded with the equivalent of \""LA, LA, LA, I CAN'T HEAR YOU!\"" When will you stop mischaracterizing my arguments? When? I have NEVER, no will I EVER, argue against not being able to link to attack sites. NEVER, get it? <p> Now, is there a reason that you think other policies are not adequate to handling the situation? Is there a reason you didn't respond to my proposal? Is there a reason you ignore most of what I say? -
[GTBacchus]: There's also the BEANS argument, as the current (protected) text of NPA is an advertisement for attack sites. If that provision stays in policy, it will be a small victory for the trolls, and it will set a terrible precedent for other mistakes like it. -
[GTBacchus]: Oh, I'm never quite sure how quickly time moves on the wiki. Fits and starts, you know? <p> One thing does occur to me: you mention [[WP:NC(NT)]]... the [[Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (names and titles)|talk page]] there is probably a good place to seek knowledgeable outside parties. If the edit warring seems about to start up again, why not ask over there for more eyes on the situation? Additionally, if Cladeal382 disagrees with the guidelines on that page, then perhaps you could direct him to make his case there. -
[GTBacchus]: It absolutely is; happy editing. -
[GTBacchus]: JoshuaZ, I'm not sure MONGO's looking to remove any links that we wouldn't already remove. I don't think that's what this is about for him. I think this dispute has come to represent, for some people, whether or not Wikipedia is willing to make a statement of solidarity and support for people who have been harassed by certain individuals on certain websites. For others, I suspect it's a quixotic exercise in trying to lawyer against the inevitable. <p> MONGO, you're right that I assumed you were advocating a site-ban. I apologize for my assumption of bad judgment; I've always been pretty certain of your good faith. -
[GTBacchus]: Yeah, I may be wrong about that, and I'm not suspecting any particular individual. I hope I'm wrong. However, ''if'' anybody in the discussion thinks that the exclusion of the paragraph in question creates a loophole for them to engage in anything shady, then they're mistaken, that's all. -
[GTBacchus]: There are those who would disagree with you, perhaps on both of those points. Doesn't the truth usually lie somewhere in between? -
[GTBacchus]: Um... that discussion was open for a full week, from 11 November through 18 November. We usually close move requests after only 5 days. How long would you have us wait? I see that the question of possibly moving the article to the scientific name was raised, but that's independent of the question of how \""nut\"" is capitalized. -
[GTBacchus]: I would say you're entirely welcome to split off the part of the article about Energon Rodimus. I was just moving the Transformer formerly (and still somewhat commonly) known as \""Hot Rod\"" to the appropriate title. -
[GTBacchus]: Huh, I guess I'm kind of old-school when it comes to such things. Thanks for the update. -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks for removing me as a party. I'll be watching the request with interest, and the case, if it is accepted. Take care. -
[GTBacchus]: I like your essay on persuasion. That's a useful angle to take on the issue. Have you seen [[WP:NOSPADE]]? It's in a somewhat similar vein. <p> I looked at the situation here, and thought about it a bit. The comment for which you were warned was not, in my opinion, ''grossly'' uncivil, but it did lump a certain other editor into the category of \""users deserving of the finger,\"" or something like that. I think it would be an entirely appropriate private comment, but as you note, those don't really happen on the wiki. I don't find it surprising that someone took offense. <p> It's probably a good rule of thumb that, if there's something you aren't comfortable saying in front of the whole world, then don't say it on Wikipedia. Not only the person you're talking to, but the person you're alluding to, are likely to read your comment, more than once. <p> I hope that helps. Like I said, I don't think you were ''far'' out of line, but if you're looking to see what it was about your remark that pushed a button, I think it was the possible implication of disrespect for the previous poster. -
[GTBacchus]: Does your family come from [[Oklahoma]] at all? -
[GTBacchus]: If you know how to add that functionality to the template, and document it, then I'd say go for it. Substing is an inelegant solution, so if there's an easy technical fix, I see no reason not to do it. -
[GTBacchus]: Um... I think you may be looking for [[User:Sbowers3|Sbowers3]]. I don't believe that you and I have interacted here, but I notice [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia:New_contributors%27_help_page#my_job_depends_on_writing_a_Wikipedia_article_re__corporate_client.21_But_I_need_to_vet_it_w.2F_company_before_posting_it this] thread where Sbowers3 answered a question of yours. If I can be of assistance, please don't hesitate to let me know. -
[GTBacchus]: Does it help to look through [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Special:Contributions\/Dee_Axelrod your contribution history]? -
[GTBacchus]: Thank you very much! -
[GTBacchus]: I believe they're all taken care of now. Thanks. -
[GTBacchus]: Ok. -
[GTBacchus]: Wow. I hardly know what to say. Congratulations, I guess. -
[GTBacchus]: Is what? What are you talking about, and what has it got to do with Wikipedia? Do I perceive the psyche in the way that you describe in that forum post? No. <p> Is this an extension of some conversation we were having earlier, perhaps over at [[WT:NOSPADE]]? -
[GTBacchus]: You seem to be referring to [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Drunkenness&diff=172195607&oldid=172051302 this] edit of mine. The paragraph I removed seemed to be mostly original research, and it was written in the style of a moral instruction book rather than an encyclopedia. It was rambling, and addressed the reader in the second person. By the end of the paragraph, it certainly wasn't Aquinas' ideas being presented, so it's unclear where Aquinas stops and the writer's interpretation starts. Overall, I didn't think it improved the article. <p> If you disagree, you're welcome to re-insert it. It would be a good idea, if you do that, to comment on the talk page explaining why you put the sentence back. -
[GTBacchus]: Yeah, you're still basically arguing for the right to engage in name-calling rather than honest debate. The answer is no, that's not okay, no matter how sanctimoniously you justify it. If you find yourself needing to argue about your interlocutor's personality, then you've conceded the main point. If you can't succeed by talking about the content rather than the contributor, then there's a good chance you're wrong. -
[GTBacchus]: I draw meaning from it. The meaning I draw is that you're pretty sure you can see through people and classify them according to your own (amateur, unpublished) theory of the \""human psyche\"". Because of this, you feel that you're justified in labeling people and dealing with them accordingly - you believe that you are an authority on who is or is not an extremist, and who can or cannot therefore work cooperatively. <p> The trouble is that you're not nearly as perceptive as you think you are. You think you have access to the \""true forces of reality\"", while anyone who disagrees with your point of view does not. That's pretty much the definition of an extremist. You'd rather label people as \""extremists\"" than learn how to interact effectively with them. Wikipedia does not sanction such pathological communication behavior, and we're not going to. To work here, you'll have to learn to work with people, and part of that involves taking off those goggles through which you see people as \""extremists\"". <p> Perhaps you're not here to write the encyclopedia in a collaborative manner. Perhaps you're here to show off just how \""right\"" you are about people. If that's the case, then you should leave. -
[GTBacchus]: Nothing further to say? Super! -
[GTBacchus]: That's taken care of now, I believe. Please let me know if you need any further assistance. -
[GTBacchus]: There is no \""not hip enough to be cited\"". The trick to including information is to say where it comes from ''when you add it''. Then it stays. Also, try not to remove information that's backed up by a citation, even if you disagree with it. -
[GTBacchus]: Once and for all? I wasn't aware we did that sort of thing around here. I'll keep an eye on the proceedings, and may provide a statement if I decide I've got anything useful to say. -
[GTBacchus]: There's no formal process for \""invalidating\"" a consensus. You just make a new consensus. There's no need to talk about what was right or wrong previously, just open a new discussion and make your case. We really don't do formal procedural solutions here. There's nothing to \""invalidate\"" about the fact that some people made a decision. We can just change our minds; it doesn't mean the previous one was \""invalid\""; that's a weird, legalistic way of thinking about it. <p> More to the point, the article is currently at your preferred location, so what's the problem? -
[GTBacchus]: I have some experience with the subject... what's your question? -
[GTBacchus]: Fair enough. Sorry if I came across as too critical. -
[GTBacchus]: Short answer: maybe. <p> You're right that different people handle it differently. There hasn't been much study of the long term effects. There are plenty of daily users who are intelligent and productive people, as well as plenty who are unmotivated slackers. Some people mellow out when they smoke pot; some people freak out. Some get energetic; some get sluggish. Some acquire intense focus; some lose the ability to focus on anything. Some wake up; some go to sleep. Most get hungry. Some people seem not to feel normal ''unless'' they smoke pot; some try it a few times and decide it's not for them. Some use for years, only to decide later that it was a destructive force in their life. Others feel that it catalyzes beneficial spiritual experiences. Some of these contradictory things will even happen to the ''same person''. <p> If you're curious, I recommend researching the subject by reading everything you can find. Our article [[Cannabis (drug)]] is a good starting point, but also follow some of the references to external sources in there. You might find answers to a lot of your questions. <p> Above all, if you're using, be careful. Be as safe as you can, think about [[set and setting]], and don't get in legal trouble - that's probably the worst way pot can mess up your life. Don't sell, and try not to buy for others. That's where you can get into staggeringly bad trouble. <p> Naturally, I am neither a doctor, nor a lawyer, and none of this should be construed as medical or legal advice. I don't encourage any kind of illegal activity. If you need medical or legal advice, talk to a medical or legal professional. -
[GTBacchus]: I'm sorry. I probably should have said something to the effect that it would probably be deleted. I didn't want to just delete it again, and tell you to stop; I didn't consider that it would be worse to let it get tagged for deletion by someone else and taken to MfD. I was mostly trying to move it out of article space, but I ended up setting you up for a nasty experience. I apologize. -
[GTBacchus]: I don't know much about those projects. I know RC patrollers are just people who happen to do that task. I guess the welcome committee are the same. They're not some kind of honor system, as anyone can do those tasks. You just put your name down if you're active, and if you feel like being listed. I'm not sure what they're \""getting away with\"". It's just a list of people who happen to work on one kind of job. <p> The only honorifics we really have here are [[Wikipedia:Barnstar]]s, which are given to individual people, by other individuals, for individual reasons. The idea of having some Wikipedians who have earned a rank and others who haven't really goes against the spirit of the project, and nobody thinks that RC patrollers or welcomers have any kind of \""rank\"". Even admins are considered ''janitors'', who have certain types of mops that are necessary for dealing with certain types of messes. <p> Most \""power\"" or prestige on the wiki comes from one's edits, one's arguments, and one's reputation - which is established through making many good edits and helping work out many arguments. The idea that you could just list your name on a page and thus hold some kind of honorific or title is... it just doesn't make sense. -
[GTBacchus]: No problem - cheers! -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks for the heads-up. It's late now, but I'll have a look at it tomorrow. -
[GTBacchus]: :) -
[GTBacchus]: Thank you. That is strange though... I've been putting <nowiki><p><\/nowiki> tags in my comments for a while now (months?), and that's the first time it's caused a rendering problem. -
[GTBacchus]: Hi. I'm working on the backlog at [[Wikipedia:Requested moves]], and it appears this move is legitimate, and only held up by the target being a protected redirect. I'd like to go ahead and unprotect and complete the move, which I'll do unless you indicate that I shouldn't within the next day or so. Thanks. -
[GTBacchus]: Claiming that IAR is the only way to deal with the situation is the recourse of the intellecutally lazy. The way to deal with that situation, as with any content dispute, is to bring more eyes to the situation, and expose your opponents logical fallacies to the light of day. Since you're correct (right?), you will easily convince disinterested parties that you're the reasonable one. <p> Edit warring is a terrible solution; it shows that you don't know how to get things done on the wiki, it makes you look like the POV-pusher when the wider community finally does look, and it fails in its aim, which is to win the content dispute. It's like trying to open a closed door by standing in the center of the room and stabbing yourself repeatedly in the leg - it's a bad idea for multiple reasons. <p> If you seriously believe that IAR is the only way to deal with a content dispute, then you've clearly never tried effective dispute resolution (walking to the door and opening it). I recommend it. Making an edit repeatedly in the face of opposition might ''feel'' very righteous, but it's blinkered, ineffective, and distracting from the good work we're trying to do. Bringing more eyes is ''always'' a better solution. -
[GTBacchus]: No problem. Happy editing! -
[GTBacchus]: I was just reading it. We agree on more than you might think. -
[GTBacchus]: I think I fixed it now. Please let me know if I can be of further assistance. -
[GTBacchus]: I don't actually know anything about the naming dispute, but was just clearing backlog at [[WP:RM]]. As far as the other user's behavior, I might be able to say something if you point me to a page where there's any dirt involved. I would suggest that you can handle it yourself by applying good dispute resolution skills. Just remember not to let it get personal, and if all else fails, go get more people. The more you can treat a content dispute as a content dispute and not let it become a personality dispute the better. Do let me know if I can be of more specific assistance. -
[GTBacchus]: I thought you retired. :p You're still not replying to the substantive issue I've raised. ''How'' - by what mechanism - does the person who's right win? You've got no answer. -
[GTBacchus]: I don't buy it. How is editing his own talk page trolling? Nobody has to read there, and we allow wide latitude in user space. This talk page protection just seems mean. I request that the talk page be unblocked. We're bocking him from editing, not trying to silence him. -
[GTBacchus]: I've added it to my watchlist. Thanks for the heads-up. -
[GTBacchus]: You're quite welcome. Thank you for [[WP:SOW\/REAP]] (the acronym worked out way too easily - pretty awesome). As you get to know Wikipedia, please don't hesitate to contact me if I can help you with any questions or red-tape navigating. (We try to keep the stuff to [[m:Instruction creep|a minimum]], but [[WP:WSS|there]] [[WP:CFD|are]] [[WP:RM|thickets]]. (At least two of those particular thickets exist for good reasons.)) <p> I notice by your userboxes that you're into math. Have you checked out [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Mathematics]]? That page, and also [[Wikipedia:Reference desk\/Mathematics]] can be fun to have on one's watchlist. The latter is also quite useful for getting questions answered, and for practice in helping others. -
[GTBacchus]: Before I \""tout it so\""? I wasn't aware of going over the top. Got any specific feedback? -
[GTBacchus]: I hope that more people do so as well. I've been thinking for a while about the page [[WP:AGF]] and how it can be improved. If you'd like, I'll let you know when\/if I try to do something about that. Way too many people are taking it as something to lawyer and to look for exceptions to. It should be stated more like the law of gravity. People don't try to find exceptions to that, at least not for long. -
[GTBacchus]: Hi, Hatmatbbat10. Thanks for dropping by, and for your vote of confidence in asking me to help you become an administrator. As I guess you can tell from the coaching page, I haven't been signed up there long, and you're the first to ask me for coaching. Being new to this, I'm not sure if there's a regular procedure to follow, but I'm probably more comfortable working without one anyway. <p> If you're ok with that, then I'm happy enough to accept you as my first coachee. I've looked briefly over your contributions, and you seem to be a good editor, so why not see whether you can contribute as an administrator as well? <p> I'd probably like to start by asking you some questions, to get a sense of what you want from the coaching experience, but first I think I should let you ask me any questions you may have about myself, or about my experience as a Wikipedian and as an admin. <p> We could set up a separate page for communication, if you like, or I'd be happy using whichever talk pages seem convenient. -
[GTBacchus]: I've updated the page, and I've left you a couple of questions at [[User talk:Hatmatbbat10\/Coaching]]. -
[GTBacchus]: I'll have a look. I can't guarantee it will be today or tomorrow, but as soon as I have some good wiki time, this is on my list. Thanks for the links and the briefing. -
[GTBacchus]: Yeah, I've tried to couch the matter in terms of \""professionalism\"" before, and that seems to work to an extent. I like the idea about distinguishing assertiveness from aggressiveness. It's certainly possible to be assertive without making personal remarks or displaying aggression. Thanks for the thoughts. -
[GTBacchus]: Thank you for the message, and congratulations on your acceptance to the Harvard Extension School! <p> I think we won't turn into an Orwellian nightmare so quickly. You can trust that there are at least a handful of sane people keeping an eye out for that. It turns out that, even in the current context, nobody is arguing for prohibitions on name-calling, enforced by blocks, while NPOV problems become harder and harder to talk about. I realize that's what some people seemed worried about, but I think that worry is based on misunderstanding the position being advanced. On both sides of the fence, what we want to be able to deal with problem editors effectively and efficiently. We're not going to hamstring or shackle anyone, and we're also going to teach better methods than the \""Bad Doggy WHAP!\"" school of conflict resolution. The result will be ''stronger'' neutrality, verifiablity and non-originality policies, not weaker ones that have somehow been hobbled to make way for civility. We know not to push in that direction. -
[GTBacchus]: What is \""the system\""? Have you been blocked for supposed incivility? What is \""suicide\"" in this context? Why bother warning me? -
[GTBacchus]: You know, there's a happy bit of timing going on here. I've just been approached in the past week by researchers from a University who are studying Wikipedia, from a variety of angles. The person I met with so far is developing accessibility software, and he put me in touch with someone who's been studying conflict on Wikipedia. I should be meeting with him soon... <p> I like your idea, [[WP:COLLEGE]]. Something like that. Or maybe different from that, who knows? I think it boils down to a few essential principles, and most problems can be solved, if not obviated completely, by sticking to a few rules of thumb. Writing down those thumbs could make it much easier to educate admins, and to refine the principles themselves, as we gain experience working with them explicitly. We could also be guided, to whatever extent we find helpful, by parallel academic research, which is apparently already in progress. <p> How does one begin something like an admin college; in a sandbox somewhere? -
[GTBacchus]: Agreed. I also note that [[Wikipedia:Administrators' how-to guide]] and [[Wikipedia:New admin school]] already exist. I don't reckon I'd ever heard of either. Can we use structures that are already in place, rather than starting from scratch? -
[GTBacchus]: Heck yeah. -
[GTBacchus]: Aren't good admin conflict resolution skills also applicable by non-admins? Most conflict resolution doesn't involve much use of the buttons, does it? I like the idea of some kind of DR training program, which could be available for any user, recommended as a prerequisite for adminship, and maybe sometimes required by ArbCom as a part of some remedy. -
[GTBacchus]: I suspect we're in broad agreement. [[WP:NAS]] is already set up, and unless people think that it's elitist (Hans?), we can use it as is. If the name bothers people, then we'll get a new name for it. The point is that it's a place containing good advice on how to deal with difficult situations that admins often handle. Naturally, that advice is available to anyone, whether they be an admin, an admin candidate, a brand new user, or whoever. -
[GTBacchus]: We've got [[Wikipedia:Admin coaching]] already, as well as [[Wikipedia:WikiProject on Adminship\/Training]]. They're tagged to merge. -
[GTBacchus]: Um... can you give me some context? I hardly know what you've just dropped on my talk page. -
[GTBacchus]: I'm dabbling there in direct response to people at [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment\/JzG2]]. The claim has been made repeatedly that those arguing for greater civility aren't sufficiently aware of the conditions that drive other editors to incivility. The word seems to be \""stop complaining and get down in the trenches, so I'm getting in. I hope to make an empirical case for what I believe to be effective dispute resolution techniques, and I'm hoping we can create some kind of structure to discover and write down good rules of thumb for handling such situations. See the above section: [[#Re: Admin training]]. <p> Nevertheless, thanks for the warning, and I would certainly welcome any pointers you can give me for navigating what seems to be quite the minefield. -
[GTBacchus]: No, expect different results this time. It seems to me there are some tricks that haven't yet been tried. -
[GTBacchus]: It's brilliant; thank you very much. -
[GTBacchus]: Works fine from this end. -
[GTBacchus]: Please see [http:\/\/www.cs.washington.edu\/homes\/travis\/ this homepage] of a [[University of Washington]] researcher who is working on studying conflicts on Wikipedia. I've read one of his papers already, and we're scheduling a face-to-face meeting for later this week. I'm encouraged that certain dispute-resolution principles are already receiving empirical support as to their effectiveness, and I'm hoping to see more research in that direction. If we could show empirically that certain behaviors tend to lower or raise the temperature, we'll be in a very good position to design strategies for handling conflicts. -
[GTBacchus]: I'll definitely pass that suggestion along. Oh, he's [[User:Leafman]], too. Now I'm off to leave a note with MEDCAB... -
[GTBacchus]: Filll, I think that's a great start. I think you enunciate a lot of very useful principles there. What, do you think, is different about an area where you're not seeing the same method work? -
[GTBacchus]: Very interesting; thank you! -
[GTBacchus]: Hi, Littleolive, thanks for dropping by. Your remark about not reinventing the wheel seems apt, but I've never studied conflict resolution formally, although I guess our article [[conflict resolution research]] is a start. I'm excited about learning more, and about applying whatever we can to disputes on Wikipedia. I'll be sure to bring this up with [[User:Leafman|Leafman]] when we meet tomorrow; thanks again for the note.  -
[GTBacchus]: There's a lot to think about there. One reply I can give you, is that people using the civility policy is a weapon is nothing to fear. That can be stopped in its tracks every time by applying the right strategy, so we do not have to tolerate any uncivil use of [[WP:CIVIL]]. Note how far that personal attack accusation on your talk page got - nobody believes it, because you didn't attack anybody. You can float right above such mudslinging, as long as you keep your own hands mud-free. <p> I really like your ideas about splitting off daughter articles; let's work on that. -
[GTBacchus]: Kim, would MEDCAB be a good structure under which to host a project on conflict resolution? -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks for the invitation, PM, that sounds like a cool project. It appears I'll have to acquire a microphone and a Skype account, but that doesn't sound prohibitively difficult. I'll work on it. -
[GTBacchus]: Huh? Um, Jim, what's keeping you from posting at [[Talk:Homeopathy]]? And Filll, could I get some feedback from you about those studies? Preferably at [[Talk:Homeopathy]]. -
[GTBacchus]: I see. Jim, can you get an account, or are you perhaps a banned user? You don't have to tell me if you are. I'm currently waiting to get feedback from more editors before I assume that those studies represent the consensus of mainstream science. Let's talk about the sources, and then we'll figure out what needs to be summarized and how. How does that sound? -
[GTBacchus]: Absolutely. Why talk about the same studies over and over again? Let's make a page where that analysis lives permanently. Can you find places where the discussion has already happened, and copy them to somewhere central? -
[GTBacchus]: I just clicked that link, and downloaded that picture... whoo! :D Thank you, Hans. There's an expression in English about trying to be \""[http:\/\/idioms.thefreedictionary.com\/all+things+to+all+people all things to all people],\"" (comes from the Bible) but that doesn't quite match what you're getting at. I think there is something, but it's not coming to me now. -
[GTBacchus]: Filll, it sounds as if you're talking about a kind of... wiki auditing project? A project that reviews various processes on Wikipedia and checks for effectiveness and efficiency? Is this what Kim's also talking about below, that could be hosted on [[meta:]], and study all the sister projects? -
[GTBacchus]: We're working on it... -
[GTBacchus]: Hi. This is a slightly weird time for me to be giving opinions on civility, as I suspect I didn't handle my recent conversation with the \""expert withdrawal\"" people too well, but I'll give you my take on the situation, since you asked. <p> For starters, I can see why you would object to the reliability of a source that runs a front page disclaimer that its management doesn't vouch for the accuracy of its contents (at that point, I think it's hardly rocket science). It's also pretty clear what's going on when suddenly they're bandying legal threats about, and talking about censorship, and there's the unmistakable smell of socks... (again, no advanced degrees required to see the lay of the land) <p> I noticed in particular your comment [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&diff=prev&oldid=200141607 here] at [[WP:AN|AN]]: \""''The thing is, you have to have some word to describe a behavior which is inappropriate, and you have to use those words when calling attention to someone who may be engaging in that behavior.''\"" That's absolutely true. I find it helpful to make a distinction between describing the behavior, and applying any kind of label to the ''person''. A user may be repeatedly adding links to non-reliable sources in violation of policy, but that can be said without using the word \""spammer\"". The least respectful label I feel comfortable applying to someone here is \""user\""... even \""editor\"" implies some level of productive contribution. If I can't call them an \""editor\"" without feeling dishonest, I'll go with \""user\"". <p> It seems unlikely that such precautions would have somehow made the user in question into a productive editor, but it's not really any less efficient to just describe the behavior, which makes the reason for blocking pretty clear and uncontroversial. What we can still avoid, in such cases, is dealing with anyone's objection over possible incivility. We don't actually have to determine bad faith in order to block, we just have to identify disruption that's likely to continue if we don't block. <p> This might be helpful: imagine your boss from work were drunk after a party or something, and you had to get them home. If not your boss, imagine a grandparent or parent or something. You might have to manage them, and even be forceful about certain things (\""no, you may not drive\""), but you would probably maintain a respectful and professional tone while doing it. You might be quite frustrated and upset, but not yet likely to call them a \""drunk\"" or a \""real pain in the ass\"", however accurate those labels might feel at the moment. It's a little bit like that. <p> I dunno... does any of that make sense? -
[GTBacchus]: I would note that the material in the above collapsing box has been copied to [[Talk:Homeopathy\/Selection of studies]], which I believe is ''not'' protected. -
[GTBacchus]: Don't warn me. Block me, if you think it's a necessary preventative measure. Don't ever throw Wikipedia rules at me as if they're laws. -
[GTBacchus]: Any questions? -
[GTBacchus]: Do you think I'm hurting Wikipedia, Raymond? I've noticed that you're rather critical of my words and actions lately. Are you unhappy with my involvement in the articles you edit? Do you think I'm doing something wrong, by trying to help work that situation towards resolution, or do you just disagree with ''how'' I'm doing that, or what? What's up? -
[GTBacchus]: By the way, if that content is hurting Wikipedia, why haven't you deleted it? -
[GTBacchus]: Well, I don't think I'm proxy editing for a banned user. I'm not making edits for him to encyclopedia articles, and I explicitly told him above that I wouldn't make edits to the article on his say-so. Either way, I'm not really concerned with what a rule somewhere might or might not say, I'm concerned with whether or not the encyclopedia is improved (call it [[WP:IAR]], if you like). Do you think my actions are hurting the encyclopedia? Are you willing to discuss putting an article together about research into homeopathy, or perhaps pointing out for the benefit of readers which studies refute those studies posted by the banned user? -
[GTBacchus]: How do we start? Shall we begin by making a list of studies, and then start annotating it? What do you think? -
[GTBacchus]: Text is good. I'm just not in a position to write any until I'm a bit more familiar with the terrain. I am at work now, so I can't jump in with both feet until later today. When I start a page, I'll post a link here, or if you beat me to it, please do the same. -
[GTBacchus]: That sounds smart. -
[GTBacchus]: I understand that it must be very frustrating to be blocked. We're discussing making a whole separate article for research related to homeopathy, so that might be a way to let people know about the research that's out there, without the need to summarize so much and give an unfair impression. -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks for expressing your concern. I'll ask for review. -
[GTBacchus]: See [[WP:AN#Request review of pagemove]]. -
[GTBacchus]: I can provide dozens of examples of page moves where we have consistently applied the rule of following the consensus of reliable sources. Please check back in a few hours when I've had the chance to find them, or you can look back through the history at [[WP:RM]]. Following the preponderance of sources is probably the ''most'' applied naming convention we deal with at requested moves. -
[GTBacchus]: The lack of consensus is somewhat illusory, as we're only looking at a discussion involving a few people. There is actually a broad and long-standing consensus that, for our naming choices, we follow our sources' lead. Not everyone agrees with that, but it seems to be the most neutral solution to our naming questions. I'm still working on compiling statistics about past RMs where diacritics have been at issue. -
[GTBacchus]: I'm already there. -
[GTBacchus]: Actually, I have to teach a class now. Back in an hour. -
[GTBacchus]: No worries; thanks. -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks. :) The sentiment is not original, but I'll accept authorship for that particular version of it. -
[GTBacchus]: If I see it, I'll do that. Happy editing. -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks for the reminder. I've been very busy with work (soon to end as Spring break begins tomorrow, and then I'll be travelling until Tuesday). I've begun, though, by making a list of all the AfDs that I've personally closed: [[User:GTBacchus\/RM closings]]. You're welcome to peruse that, but I still intend to compile some statistics regarding which naming convention was applied, how I closed, and whether it stuck. I'll work on that next week. -
[GTBacchus]: It's a not-getting-off-the-ground ''attempt'' to abuse CIVIL. If there's no effect, then there's no abuse. I see nobody buying that accusation, do you? I'm typing a comment there now. -
[GTBacchus]: It seems that the last three moves I closed relating to diacritics in names were [[Talk:Eoin MacNeill|here]], [[Talk:Malin Akerman|here]] and [[Talk:Vicente Fernandez (golfer)|here]]. I'm working through the list slowly, which is actually very interesting. I'll probably put it all in a table and see what I can learn. I'm also checking with some other regular closers, to see whether community sentiment has been drifting away from the consensus I've learned about. If so, I'd like to know. -
[GTBacchus]: How so? -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks. :) I hope I'm casting the idea in a language that makes more sense to the target audience. I'm not always good at that, and I've been fumbling for new tricks. -
[GTBacchus]: Yes, I'm interested; thanks for the note. I'm also back in town, and on spring break, so I have time to do things. (Before this past weekend, I had taught for 19 consecutive days - ouch.) <p> I'll pick up a headset today, and post here when I've done it. -
[GTBacchus]: Hi, thanks for dropping by. I've used it a few times, and there's no particular feedback that leaps to mind, but I'll certainly think about it and get in touch with you should anything come up... actually, one thing: it seems that when you look at an article, you see the history of contributions there, and when you look at a user's page, you see ''their'' contribution history, but I have been curious about the history of contributors to a user talk page. I don't know if it's possible now to see that. <p> I'll let you know if I think of anything else. -
[GTBacchus]: That's good to know; thanks. I'll be headed out in an hour or so. -
[GTBacchus]: ...and I'm now the proud owner of a brand new Logitech USB headset! -
[GTBacchus]: Indeed. I still have to install Skype; I guess that's my project for today. I'd be happy enough to talk before next Monday, while I'm still on spring break, but anytime is fine. Aiming for Seattle evening time is a good idea, if we're doing it next week. -
[GTBacchus]: Yeah, 22:30 UTC is too early for me; I'm still at work then most days. -
[GTBacchus]: That's a very interesting page. I'm not sure you've established that there are many more articles not following [[WP:UE]] than following it. You've listed a few pages where diacritics are used in titles, and even fewer where they've been removed. There seem to be certain languages over which use of special letters has been especially contentious. <p> One point to consider is that [[WP:UE]] does not say \""don't use diacritics or non-English letters\"". It says use what most English sources use, and what most English speakers will most easily recognize. In some cases, that means to retain commonly used diacritics (e.g., [[Charlotte Bront\xeb]], [[C\xf4te d'Ivoire]]), so casting the issue as pro-diacritics versus anti-diacritics isn't entirely accurate. I'm in favor of optimizing Wikipedia for general readers who speak English; that's very different from being against diacritics. <p> I think your list shows that there are many instances where people have decided to ignore our naming conventions to keep a preferred version of a name. I don't see that the discussions you've linked to contain any reason for doing that other than preferring accuracy over other considerations. What I don't see is any critical discussion of why accuracy should be preferred over recognizability in these cases, when our naming convention policy explicitly says to prefer recognizability over accuracy, for explicit reasons. If that's not really our naming convention, then we should change what it says, and stop claiming to follow a rule we don't follow. <p> I absolutely agree that we should bring the issue to a larger audience. Why don't we get a page of evidence in good shape, and then file a [[Request for comment]]? The discussion could be advertised at the [[Wikipedia:Village pump|Village pump]] and other appropriate places, and it could be hosted at [[Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (use English)]] Does that sound like a good idea? -
[GTBacchus]: Sure, that seems fine. -
[GTBacchus]: Let's see... 02:30 UTC is 7:30 here... we're still talking about Monday? I actually have a tutoring appointment just ending then, and it takes me another half hour to get home. That time would be great on a Tuesday, Thursday or Friday. Sorry to have a difficult schedule! :( -
[GTBacchus]: No, it's not that, I've just been using my spring break time strategically, and have been keeping fairly busy with a couple of projects. I've installed skype, and just need to fire it up and add you as a contact. I'm not posting from home just now, but I'll give it a try later this evening. Are you in a time zone near mine (US Pacific Daylight Time)? -
[GTBacchus]: \""Magical\""? There's nothing magical about the fact that people respond well to being dignified. I'll have a look. -
[GTBacchus]: I find it funny that you're replying here. You say that the RfC has achieved all the constructive purpose it can achieve, but the reason I asked ''there'', is because I thought it would be constructive ''there'' to balance out some of the negative comments with positive ones, as it's likely that we would find ''there'' many people who are unaware of Guy's good contributions. With me, you're largely preaching to the choir, although I didn't know much in the way of specifics. I would hope that it wouldn't be inappropriate at a user RfC to detail some of the Good Work they've done, but that's your call. -
[GTBacchus]: That doesn't sound bad. There's certainly no need for frustration or accusations over a simple matter of checking whether a source is reliable or not. The only question to ask is, is the source reliable for the article in question? In this case it's pretty clear that it has consensus support as a reliable source. <p> That could have easily been established without any remarks such as \""''I invite you to continue down this path if you want to find out what biting is'',\"" but then we might start coming across as adults, at least on one side of such conflicts. That would be terrible, huh? -
[GTBacchus]: Filll, are you suggesting that the approach of replying to his arguments rather than simply yelling at him is something different from what I've been suggesting all along? What the hell do you think I mean by \""dignify\""? Do you think I want to you to roll over for his arguments? I don't. I want you to be effective, while leaving out the juvenile shit. This is what I've been saying all along, consistently. You're an adult and I believe you can do it. You're big enough and man enough to eschew playground point-scoring behavior. Rise to it; I know you can. <p> This situation was actually handled pretty well. Instead of simply continuing to argue with him, and letting it get personal, you had the good sense to go to the RS noticeboard and get wider input. Then he agreed to go along with consensus. What's wrong there? <p> Your implication that I think anyone should \""leave the entire thing\"" to some kind of content-free approach is quite frankly beneath you. You're easily smart enough to know I've never advocated anything that resembles that, and that your implication is therefore intellectually dishonest. Can you explain to me why you feel the need to make these contemptuous remarks to me so regularly? Please. -
[GTBacchus]: I'm sorry you thought there was an environment on Earth, or in the universe, where being something other than consistently excellent was a good idea. You're certainly not to be blamed for some mistaken notion you used to hold. -
[GTBacchus]: Have I ever taken a position like that? Yes or no. -
[GTBacchus]: I don't have a low opinion of you. I criticize people whom I respect; otherwise, what's the point? If I don't respect you, I won't say anything. I consider you a valuable Wikipedian, and a fellow member of my species, therefore my brother (or sister). I assume you're here trying to make the world a little better, just like the rest of us. What higher opinion can there be than that? <p> The concept of being \""reported for incivility\""; why do you think of it as a law? That ''so'' misses the point. If you ''must'' think of WP:CIVIL as a rule, apply it only to yourself, never to others, and never assert that you've been civil. I haven't \""got anyone down\"" as being \""trollish\""; haven't I said enough that that should be obvious? <p> Whether revealing what you believe to be the underlying zeitgeist of a situation might of might produce negativity, depending how you say it. There are a million ways to be honest. -
[GTBacchus]: Clearly stating the question sounds like a great idea, and I have to admit that it's not a trivial matter in this case. What occurs to me is that we wish to clarify our naming conventions regarding certain articles where a certain kind of dispute commonly arises. Simply stating the dispute involves talking a little bit about the [[Latin alphabet]]. <p> English uses a certain version of the Latin alphabet, with 26 letters and very rare use of diacritics (the [[diaeresis]] being a notable exception, as in [[Charlotte Bront\xeb]]). Many languages use versions of the Latin alphabet containing letters not found in the English alphabet, and many languages use diacritic marks that are not used in English. These two issues (non-English lettters and diacritics) are largely independent, but I think it's fair to say that we wish to address both. <p> Our question is how we decide naming and usage when a subject's name is in a language that uses a Latin alphabet different from the one used in English. In particular, we're asking how to decide naming and usage when a subject's name contains non-English letters or diacritics, in a Latin alphabet. We specify that this issue arises with Latin alphabets, because in other cases, we have to use a [[Romanization]] anyway, so we just pick the one most commonly used in sources. It's the smaller differences among languages using slightly different Latin alphabets that gives rise to the controversies we see. <p> We ask this question with our naming conventions in mind, considering whichever sections seem relevant. Naturally, we keep in mind that the conventions that exist are not set in stone, and that each decision is open to re-evaluation in the light of new examples or arguments. <p> I think the relevant guidelines here are likely to be the ones most often cited. Certainly [[WP:UE]] and [[WP:COMMONNAME]] would make the list, and we ought to look at [[WP:NAME]] for general guidance. That last one is where we see the summary: \""''Generally, article naming should prefer what the greatest number of English speakers would most easily recognize, with a reasonable minimum of ambiguity, while at the same time making linking to those articles easy and second nature.''\"" Every one of our naming conventions is either an elucidation of that principle in some context, or it's an exception to that principle made for a good reason. <p> Another principle often cited is the [[Principle of least astonishment]]. I suspect that what we're seeing in this case is that different people are astonished by different things. Someone unfamiliar with Novak \u0110okovi\u0107's Serbian name might find unfamiliar letters and marks more astonishing if redirected to that page, while those familiar with his Serbian name might certainly find \""Novak Djokovic\"" rather astonishing if redirected there. <p> Anyway, does the above seem to contain a fair statement of the issue we're talking about? -
[GTBacchus]: Oh, goody: a numbered list. (1) Either name them, or let's not talk about them. I can't speak for anyone other than myself, and I don't believe that any Wikipedian holds the caricatured position you've described. I think that's your own invention. (2) You may be correct about what would happen if the Civility policy were extrapolated and standards lowered, but since ''nobody I know is arguing to extrapolate [[WP:CIVIL]] or to lower standards'', this is irrelevant. Let's talk about my actual position, not some fictitious one, eh? (3) One can not have too much good sense. One can not be too good of a communicator. One can not have too much skill in handling conflict. If you think that WP:CIVIL represents anything other than those, then you're mistaken. (4) You're not the only person who ''believes'' in some kind of \""WP:CIVIL gone mad\"" theory. There are people here who believe all sorts of things; that doesn't make them true. There are far more people who believe that the Earth is round, that men landed on the moon, that Elvis really died, and that treating others with honest decency (not with caricatured kid gloves) is smart. (5) You state without evidence that \""''these are exactly the kind of extreme positions that their comments lead to''.\"" I don't believe you. I've never seen it, and until I see it, I'll continue to believe that there is a world of difference between saying \""let's not be dicks to each other\"" and saying \""let's ban the use of all four-letter words, and turn every good idea about interaction into an imperative, enforced w\/ blocks and bans\"". You seem to want to equate those two, but they are very different. It seems that every time I state the former, you reply to the latter. Think about that. (6) Are you offended by my use of profanity? Yes or no? If  you're not, then why do you mention it? Are you \""scoring points\"" or engaging in honest dialogue? The two are mutually exclusive. Now, I'm not \""offended\"" by your misuse of the apagogical argument, I'm just not convinced by it, because it's transparently spurious. If you say that one sheep is black, and I say, \""He says all sheep are black, which is clearly false! Get him off the agriculture committee,\"" then I'm not using the apagogical argument, I'm being absurd. If you want to argue that some particular policy is a slippery slope, you have to offer some kind of evidence that the slope is slippery. Not all slopes are automatically slippery, especially when it's trivially easy to monitor it. Your \""apagogical argument\"" is that requesting basic decency will lead to a draconian enforcement of political correctness. This is unfounded, and you're not successfully making a case for it. <p> To the point (if there is one to this thread) I'm not here to talk about some caricatured position, I'm here to talk about ''mine''. Why are you here, on my talk page, arguing with me? What is your point right now? Didn't you come to tell me about some situation, and then when it basically worked out, to vaunt that I'm somehow wrong about something? What are you talking about, and who are you talking to? If you want to talk to me, about my approach to dispute resolution, then let's talk about ''that'', and not about some nonsense you made up. Do you even have any idea what I've been suggesting, or have you been too busy extrapolating it to absurdity? -
[GTBacchus]: Filll, I don't think that rationalist, pro-science editors necessarily treat others like dicks. I think it can happen that any editor might act like a dick when they're not using their best judgment. My above statement didn't imply that pro-science editors treat others like dicks typically. ''I didn't say a word about pro-science editors'', because I see dickishness on both sides of pretty much every fence on the wiki. What I have said, consistently, is that we will do well to treat each other with respect, and not with contempt. You're right that it's not very helpful for me to characterize contemptuous treatment as \""being a dick\"". I apologize for that unhelpful use of inflammatory language. I absolutely don't think that pro-science editors are typically dicks. I think that being pro or anti science, and behaving constructively or not in a dispute, are entirely unrelated. -
[GTBacchus]: An assumed position of moral superiority? An assumed position of hypocrisy? I certainly don't assume any of that. I don't believe that moral valuations have meaning, so how can I assume moral superiority? I'm claiming that treating others respectfully is more ''effective'' than treating them disrespectfully. That's not a moral claim; it's a pragmatic one. I'm sorry if my tone upsets you. I'll try to adjust it, if I can understand what you're offended by. I assure you that I see you as morally flawless; infallible in fact. That has no bearing on specific practical skills that you may or may not have. If you were trying to solve an integral using substitution, and I were to suggest integration by parts as more effective, I would not be holding myself morally above you, and it would seem odd for you to take it that way. Again though, I'm sorry that you're offended, and I'll be very careful to eschew all language that would imply moral judgment. -
[GTBacchus]: Yeah, thinking about this further, I really don't know where you would get the idea that I think rationalists have got the market cornered on dickishness. That's just bizarre. I've taken people on both \""sides\"" of this dispute to task for being unconstructive; if you cherry-pick for instances where I was talking to someone with a pro-science POV, then I guess you're happily inventing reality, and maybe I shouldn't bother you. However, out here in the world people actually live in, I've been very consistent saying that ''everyone'' would be smart to put down the ''ad hominem'' remarks, put down the personal labels, and talk about content rather than about each other. Maybe you'd like to twist that utterly reasonable position into some indefensible straw man, but you're not convincing anyone. <p> My position is actually just that we can be professional, as opposed to hot-headed, unprofessional, and contemptuous. Do you honestly disagree with that? I doubt that you do. -
[GTBacchus]: Hi, Raymond. I am a bit busy at work this week, with quarter grades due, and I'm also helping my employer deal with a legal issue. Whenever I find some good wiki-time, I'll have a look, and see if I can speak with him. Thanks for the heads up, and I hope I have a chance to chime in before it's all blown over. -
[GTBacchus]: I've got half a day of work left before the weekend. If he can last that long, or not, I'll talk with him. -
[GTBacchus]: I have begun my reply at [[User:GTBacchus\/AGF Challenge Exercise Answers]]. I still don't know why it's called the \""AGF challenge\"". -
[GTBacchus]: I wasn't sure exactly what you meant at the time, but I think we're pretty much on the same page. Thanks for stopping by to clarify, and also for the vote of confidence. I look forward to seeing you around the wiki. :) -
[GTBacchus]: I've replied there; thanks for the heads-up. -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks for your input. It seems that someone else agreed with us, and has moved the article back. -
[GTBacchus]: I've yet to see it. I don't have time to read Wikipedia Review. I just read one Register article that didn't remotely approach the position you're claiming. I'd love to see (someday, when someone has time) ''one'' (1) link to somewhere that someone says that if we would just AGF more, then everything would be ok. I've ''never, ever'' seen that claim made. I would be very happy to see it, once. -
[GTBacchus]: If live examples do exist, why not link to one or more, when you say it's a charge that's \""frequently leveled\""? I have a hard time believing that. -
[GTBacchus]: Hello! Wow, I am a space cadet, it seems. I got your email, but somehow didn't connect that today was today and what that meant. I feel very silly right now; please feel free to call or email and I'll apologize a couple of times and we can set something up. Sorry! -
[GTBacchus]: I've just re-read all of the views posted on the recent RfC, and none of them approximates \""too many established editors on Wikipedia are unfair, and are un[[WP:CIVIL|CIVIL]], and do too much [[WP:BITE|BITE]]ing and if they would just [[WP:AGF|AGF]] more, everything would be ok.\"" I mean, none of them even comes close to that. Am I just missing it? I see people saying, \""You cannot just wikilove trolls to death,\"" but I see '''nobody''' saying that you can. What am I missing? This charge is supposed to be \""frequently leveled,\"" but I've never seen anything close to it said. Can you show me one instance of one soul taking this position? I'm growing concerned that it is entirely fictional. -
[GTBacchus]: I don't get it. You're asserting that if we would just AGF more, everything would be ok? Are ''you'' the \""wikilove\"" guy Filll's been talking about? -
[GTBacchus]: Many thanks, and I certainly understand not wanting to dig. -
[GTBacchus]: I wonder, have you read any replies to your AGF challenge that take the Pollyanna perspective? -
[GTBacchus]: Sorry for being dense. I never can keep track of who's on which \""side\"" in these things. I think that maybe the best thing that could happen in this general dispute would be for people to find out what their opponents actually believe, rather than making that part up. I'm seeing it pile up at the Arb case, too. \""So-and-so says that I think such-and-such, but I've never said that and I don't think it.\"" That's all avoidable. -
[GTBacchus]: I'd rather you didn't leave it at that. I'm trying to learn here. -
[GTBacchus]: Have I argued for more leniency and less restrictions on editors? Either way, I'm interested, but I'm not sure I know what you're referring to there. Which restrictions? -
[GTBacchus]: Sorry, I was asking that of Filll, more than of you. I'm trying to figure out who, or where, are these \""wikilove people\"" with whom I've sometimes been associated. I'm still interested in hearing more of your thoughts too, on this issue, if you'll share them. -
[GTBacchus]: Don't worry, Filll, I don't think anybody's suggesting that you're in favor of biting people, or against AGF. I certainly don't think that about you; never have. As for your point about \""''those arguing for more leniency and tolerance for letting any editor include whatever they want'',\"" I'm pretty sure nobody has argued for that, or anything closely approximating it. I've certainly never heard it said. Thirdly, nobody here has suggested that you have a problem with representing pseudoscience on Wikipedia, and I think we're all on the same page that the question is \""how?\"". It sounds as if we're more or less in agreement, no? -
[GTBacchus]: By the way, an observation. Your last post begins, \""let me disabuse you of some of those notions,\"" and then you don't disagree with anything he said. That's interesting. Of what notion were you disabusing Martin? <p> One other question - what does \""unCIVIL\"" mean, and how is it different from \""uncivil\""? -
[GTBacchus]: Right. Martin didn't say that Filll or anyone else was unfair, uncivil, biting, etc. He said that RAWE editors ''perceive'' others as accusing them of unfairness, incivility, biting, etc. I'm pretty sure Filll didn't disagree with that, and that's all that Martin asserted. Thus, of what notion was Filll \""disabusing\"" Martin? <p> As for \""uncivil\"" versus \""unCIVIL\"", I guess I do know the difference, but I was attempting to remind Filll of something I said earlier - don't grant your opponents the power to define the language. That is a defeatist strategy. Reclaim the word \""civility\"" to mean what it really means, and join me in saying \""there is not such thing as a 'CIVIL violation'. Our civility policy is not a law, and it's not susceptible of 'violation'\"". If we grant that there is such a thing as a \""civility violation\"", which we do by using their language, then we grant too much. Let's reclaim the terms of the discussion, and stop using fiction words such as 'unCIVIL'. Don't even use the all-caps CIVIL. It means nothing, and if you allow it to mean something, you're giving your opponents power, hand over fist. Careful! -
[GTBacchus]: It hurts my eyes, too. What's worse than that is that, everytime Filll says it, he's ''acknowledging defeat'', and I'm not ok with that, because I still think he can, and should, win. It's the pessimist's fallacy: granting your opponents the right to define the terms of discourse, and I'm not happy to see people who are essentially ''right'' committing that fallacy. -
[GTBacchus]: Yes, indeed. A lot has gone on at that essay this last weekend, and I have comments about a lot of it. I very much appreciate your posts in that thread, and I agree that you're articulating the intended message of NOSPADE very well. I agree that Shoemaker seemed to get the wrong idea about that essay, but that means someone else could come to the same misunderstanding, so we might as well improve the page to make such errors less likely. <p> The duck business... I don't know. After some discussion over at SPADE, I came to the idea that the \""if it walks like a duck...\"" adage just doesn't hybridize too well with the ugly duckling story. If you put it back, I certainly won't fight over it. <p> I need to drive from this computer to another one across town, but then I'll add some comments on the talk page there. Thanks for the note. -
[GTBacchus]: Looking at [[Talk:Terminator (franchise)#T4]], there doesn't appear to be consensus that a split is a good idea at this point. Do you think that should be addressed first? -
[GTBacchus]: Ok, it appears someone's already unprotected it. -
[GTBacchus]: I've watchlisted them; thanks. -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks for the links to the example, and for bumping this thread to the top of my attention. I'll have a look, and keep this article in mind as we develop tools for working on this type of problem. I'm not sure the intent of your question, whether I agree with consensus or NPOV. My answer is \""yes, without question\"". -
[GTBacchus]: Consensus is not supermajority. Consensus is defined as \""all major concerns have been addressed\"". You clearly have major concerns which are not addressed, therefore there is no consensus. There is no conflict between ''actual'' consensus and NPOV. -
[GTBacchus]: What I'm saying is ''that's not consensus'', and if people are passing it off as consensus, it's because there's not a large enough participation to reveal that it isn't really consensus. If you're not content with the way your concerns were addressed, then we have not yet found consensus. As for your not seeing why you should continue at Chiropractic, I won't presume to tell you where to direct your energy. Doing the same thing over and over is generally not recommended, so maybe another approach? In general, I think time spent arguing with one or two people would be better spent finding four or five more, uninvolved ones, but that's a very non-specific adage, and possibly not very helpful when you've already been on the case for so long. <p> I'm quite hopeful about some discussion that's occurring about how to improve the way we handle articles on topics such as alternative medicine - I'll admit that, as a wiki and a community, we're not very good at it yet. I would also maintain that it's important for us to get good at it, and that it's with articles such as Chiropractic that we'll learn the most. <p> I'm curious, you mentioned above some changes that you'd like to see made. What have you got in mind? -
[GTBacchus]: I would tend to support an article-based approach rather than an editor-based approach. Thus, I'm leery of a plan that talks about \""identifying and dealing with problem editors\"". I tend to think that the best approach isn't based on identifying \""bad guys\"", but I'm open to being shown wrong. -
[GTBacchus]: I can't tell whether or not you're responding to what I just said. I think an editor-based strategy is a mistake, but I'll be happy enough to see it tried in a real situation, while editors are paying close attention to what works and what doesn't. -
[GTBacchus]: I'm pretty sure we're dealing with someone for whom English isn't a first language. I'll choose not to laugh at them, and if you're going to use my talk page to laugh at people for language mistakes, I'll thank you to leave. Constructive comments are always welcome; the other kind, never. -
[GTBacchus]: I'm sure I don't know what you mean. I'm not being incautious, and I don't know what you mean by my \""past record\"". -
[GTBacchus]: \""''Calm down and extend some good faith for a minute''.\"" Thanks for telling me what to do. Have you ever noticed how well that works, at de-escalating disputes? <p> As for whether your comment was \""obviously\"" a gentle rub, it \""obviously\"" wasn't obvious to me. Do I know about your history with QuackGuru? No. So what's \""obvious\""? <p> Thanks for the explanation, anyway. -
[GTBacchus]: Yes you can. You can be as communicative or as uncommunicative as you like. -
[GTBacchus]: Merzul, I think your observations are good. If this were my first interaction with Filll, I would certainly not have said what I said. However, this is the n-th stop on a long series of interactions we've had. Filll, in my observation, has a history and pattern of including unnecessary and inflammatory personal remarks in posts that should be about content. That was a great example of why it's foolish to do that, and I pointed it out. Maybe Filll's talk page would have been a better place to do so, but when I observe counter-productive behavior that exemplifies a pattern I've already mentioned to the editor, I may very well point it out. Eventually, Filll may realize that keeping it professional and courteous is in his best interest; that will be a good day for the project, because he does good work, aside from the tendency to disparage others. <p> Filll's suggesting that I \""be a bit cautious\"" is mysterious to me, because I don't know how I'm being incautious, or what sort of danger I'm trying to avoid here. He can explain that or not, as he sees fit. -
[GTBacchus]: Ok, thanks. -
[GTBacchus]: I think we're not in a hurry, and I'd like to see a more broad-based demonstration of consensus before doing something that's very, very likely to be reverted. I don't agree with adding the URL, but I'm not religious about it. We may disagree on that point, but I think we both agree that we should take a measured, consensus-based approach. We're on the policy high-ground with that position, because ArbCom has tasked the community with developing a policy solution to precisely this type of situation. <p> If the community ends up adopting a principled stance that implies we should host the URL, or the link, then I'll support that consensus. It isn't, however, here yet. -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks Dan. I don't always succeed at presenting my arguments as you say, but I do try. <p> In connection to the link we're talking about, I would point out that ArbCom made a specific exception ([http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3ARequests_for_arbitration%2FMONGO&diff=83701444&oldid=83698964 asked], [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_arbitration\/MONGO&diff=83711912&oldid=83704706 answered]) to the \""no links to ED\"" ruling for an unlinked URL that was on my user page from [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User:GTBacchus&diff=81178336&oldid=81171418 13 October 2006] until [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User:GTBacchus&diff=122882954&oldid=121091330 14 April 2007]. That was the closest thing we had to a neutral article on ED for those six months, and it didn't cause the sky to fall. <p> True, I oppose including the link in the article, for reasons that are in a state of flux right now, but I think there's a big difference. The URL on my page wasn't going to be used for trolling, whereas one in the article is much more likely to be. I also hadn't really thought about the legal aspect at that time. -
[GTBacchus]: I like the section. It's a good idea to address that term as it is being used. Thanks, and thanks for the heads-up. -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks for the information. When and if I decide to edit that article, I'll be acting as an editor, not as any kind of puppet. Thanks for understanding. At this time, I have no plans to do anything with the above. That may change in the future. -
[GTBacchus]: If you can point to specific articles, I may be able to say something more concrete. -
[GTBacchus]: Hi. I am the Tony Jacobs who was a graduate fellow at SFI in early 2000. My most current email address should be the same one it was then - if you use [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Special:EmailUser\/GTBacchus this page] to email me, then I can reply, and you'll have my address without me having to list it right here, in public. Take care.  -Tony Jacobs\/
[GTBacchus]: Hi. As a mathematics student and teacher, I find the math reference desk here to be one of the most useful resources on the internet. I have used the desk from both sides - both asking and answering - although I've been online so infrequently of late that I haven't been around. When I start a Ph.D. program in late August, you may be seeing more of me there. -
[GTBacchus]: Regarding that source, my question is: Why is the journal \""Archives of Surgery\"" not a reliable source, in your opinion? If someone supporting that source were listening, I'd ask whether its statement of results (\""placebo therapy at best, quackery at worst\"") is the most representative statement we can find of what mainstream studies tend to say, or whether its wording is more severe than most comparable studies. -
[GTBacchus]: I've made an edit to the article, with a comment, and I've added the page to my watchlist. I'll have another look later. -
[GTBacchus]: Yeah, when you put it that way... I guess I was thinking I'll be more immersed in mathematics other than the high-school classes I've been teaching, for which I don't often need the reference desk. <p> Thanks for the vote of confidence. I've been pretty inactive lately, partly just due to life, and partly due to a series of interactions that gave me a lot to think about. I'll be surprised though, if my participation doesn't pick up soon. After all, I'll have all sorts of grad-school responsibilities to procrastinate, and Wikipedia is incredibly useful in that regard. :) -
[GTBacchus]: I've replied at the talk page. These articles would certainly benefit from some careful attention. -
[GTBacchus]: Hi. I'm currently on the road, moving from Seattle to Texas. I'm still happy to coach you, but I can't focus on anything but traveling until I get to where I'm going. Let me message you then? It's great to hear from you; I hope things are going well. -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks. It took me a few days longer than I expected, but I finally made it to north Texas. It will be a couple of weeks yet before I'm in any way settled in, but watch this space. Now that I'm in grad school again, I should have lots of important work to procrastinate, so I'll probably maintain an active presence here again... -
[GTBacchus]: Hmm. As far as I know, ''every'' prepositional phrase is either an adjective or an adverb. Rather than argue about it at all, I'd like to see a reference to an accepted grammatical source or style guide on this topic. It's my experience that grammar aficionados trying to convince one another of anything is pretty useless, unless one considers it fun. I do not. -
[GTBacchus]: I hope you do not assume that I am somehow sheltered from article-space disputes. Quite the contrary, I am regularly involved in such questions, albeit more often as a referee than as a participant. I find IAR to be alive and well in content disputes. You don't need to \""explain\"" to me how they go, because I've been around that block, many times. <p> It is true that many people read our policies and guidelines as rules that must be followed (\""must\"" in the case of policy, anyway). This is a problem, and it hurts the project. However, if someone quotes WP:WEIRDRULE and someone else points out that here is some good reason to ignore WP:WEIRDRULE, then in my experience, the appropriate conversation happens, and anyone suggesting that rules are somehow fully binding finds out that they are mistaken. I find that people are pretty good at understanding that the written rules are distillations of good ideas that people have had, and that they are always negotiable on a case-by-case basis. I see WP:IAR cited regularly, and correctly, and it ''is'' taken seriously when the application makes sense. If you like, I can point it out to you the next time I see it happen in a content dispute. It is not always explicitly cited, and I can see how someone thinking in terms of rules (such as yourself?) would not recognize a valid application of IAR without an explicit citation. <p> One thing you've written above disturbs me: \""''...any particular detail or loophole in the wording is taken as is, since there's no other basis for establishing consensus''\"". That is neither my experience, nor is it acceptable. The absolutely ''is'' another basis for establishing consensus, namely: reasoned discourse. Good reasons trump rules, rightly and regularly. The idea that an imagined \""loophole\"" should carry more weight than a well-reasoned argument is shockingly wrong. <p> The core content policies - [[WP:NPOV]], [[WP:V]] and [[WP:NOR]] - are better understood as definitions than as rules. I make that statement based on long experience, and not based on some metaphysics that you wish to condescend to. It is a ''practical'' statement, based on editing pages in practical settings. Anyone exploiting what they think is a loophole is rules-lawyering, and they hurt the project by doing so. They should be discouraged, not enabled - and I am definitely talking about article content disputes. <p> I have written a bit of other material in response to your post here that will probably wind up in an essay about the various roles of rule-pages on Wikipedia. I'll certainly let you know when it's posted. -
[GTBacchus]: Well, you seem quite well-convinced that I don't really know what content disputes are like. I'll just let you believe what you wish. Have a nice day. -
[GTBacchus]: No worries; I only changed it because it was a double-redirect at the time. Thanks for letting me know. -
[GTBacchus]: Hi. That task list is automatically generated, so I don't actually know what you're talking about, but I'm glad you wikified an article. Cheers. :) -
[GTBacchus]: If the source is unpublished, then the material is not [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verifiable]] in sources that can be checked, so we would likely delete the information as [[Wikipedia:No original research|original research]]. -
[GTBacchus]: Hello. I'm guessing you found me via my h2g2 account. Otherwise, what an astonishing coincidence. I'm going to go ahead and reply there, where I think my comments would be more relevant. Cheers. -
[GTBacchus]: Hi. I've looked at the article, and made a few minor wikifying edits. I've also read the talk page, and scanned the history. I ''haven't'' yet looked at the sources, or at the edits in detail. I'm just posting to let you know that I am having a look into the situation. My initial impression is that there are really only the two of you involved, so I think seeking outside eyes is a great step to have taken. <p> The notability issues are likely to echo many previous notability discussions, so finding people who've worked with a lot of those might be a good way to avoid repeating past conflicts and misunderstandings. Such people can probably be found at [[WT:NOTE]], although that page... is the talk page of a controversial guideline, so it's hard to say what might happen there. <p> Of course, one way to generate input regarding notability in an article is to take it to AfD, but that might not be the tack you want to take... <p> If you've got a list of articles that seem to make up a larger conflict of which this is part, cool. I'd look at that. If something that spans many articles is really one conflict, then we might as well look at it as one thing. -
[GTBacchus]: Reminding editors to stay on-topic does not seem \""unhelpful\"" to me. Is there a question in that AfD that is being decided for anything but source-based reasons? How is straying from that topic \""helpful\""? -
[GTBacchus]: Yeah, by responding to those accusations, you prolonged an off-topic, irrelevant conversation, using the forum of an AfD discussion to engage in personal disputes. That's inappropriate, hence, \""get a room\"". If you really want to pursue the topic of what that IP thinks your bias is, take it to User talk: <p> The correct way to deal with an editor like that is to ''refuse'' to be dragged off-topic. There is nothing relevant in an AfD discussion other than the existence of non-trivial coverage in multiple, independent, reliable sources. Red herrings are not to be chased. That's if you want AfD to work properly. -
[GTBacchus]: No worries about earlier. I understand that it can be very frustrating to collaborate with someone who plays pedant with the supposed \""rule book\"". (As original writer and sometime editor of [[WP:WIARM]], I have a certain bias regarding rules.) The silver lining is that this might be the event that leads to a wider consensus forming regarding AI finalists, one that is clearer and less susceptible to rule-play. One can only hope... -
[GTBacchus]: I wouldn't worry about anyone Ignoring All Rules with this one. It's likely to be decided more or less \""by the book\"". <p> On a related note, you might want to think about not letting arguments here get to you too personally. Eventually, we'll probably have a well-sourced article on Whatshisname, and any delays in the meanwhile aren't going to take away anyone's life or liberty. Your desire to improve the Wikipedia is great, but you don't want to let this project cut into your enjoyment of life. There are some good tricks for dealing with vexatious editors that you might look into. <p> Best of luck to you. -
[GTBacchus]: Huh. You seem to take a real crime\/punishment view of what goes on here. I really don't. If someone is a jerk, the best reaction isn't to \""tell on them\"" or to try to get them censured in some way. It's to just set an example by being better. I'm the last guy you should be asking to \""topic-ban\"" someone. All I'm going to do is advocate that you learn how to work with them, because, ultimately, you can't topic-ban them all. -
[GTBacchus]: I'm sorry that you take my position as allowing someone to slide along. That's not what I'm talking about. I wish you luck. -
[GTBacchus]: :What's the great harm in an AfD? If the article is worth keeping, then it won't be deleted, and that's fine, right? There's no point in me discussing it with him. No rule says you have to inform an article's author if you take an article to AfD. It may be an obnoxious thing he did, but what do you want me to do, spank him for it? Just go to the AfD and calmly explain why the article should be kept, and then carry on with whatever other editing you're doing. <p> I don't mean to make it sound as if you're doing something \""wrong\"", I just know that there's no point it trying to get justice here. This isn't court, it's an encyclopedia. Being a jerk is eventually its own punishment; he's gonna have to lie in the bed that he makes. Don't sweat it. -
[GTBacchus]: :::Informing the creator and major contributors is very courteous, and is a great idea. Many people do it. You're very unlikely to convince Wikipedians to create a rule about it. A huge amount of site culture exists against that sort of thing. <p> What you might not realize is that Wikipedia '''explicitly does not function according to rule of law.''' This surprises the hell out of some people. It's very anarchic, and the most ridiculous thing about it is that it works. Please read [[WP:IAR]] and [[WP:WIARM]]. This is not a game where you get to appeal to rules. <p> The good news is that it's better this way. Anyone who keeps making stupid AfD nominations is digging their own grave, and you should learn that \""letting them dig\"" is an incredibly powerful position. Take the long view of things, forget about rules, and enjoy Wikipedia. -
[GTBacchus]: :::Oh, but to answer your question, [[WT:AFD]] and [[WP:VP\/P]] are places to discuss new rules regarding deletion. -
[GTBacchus]: :::::Yeah, I agree it's weird. The only rule is \""good encyclopedia\"". Everything else either falls into line under that, or else it's vapor. Lots of things that look just like rules are really just conventions, written down because they work most of the time. Eventually though, working is more important than being written down. <p> There are certainly disruptions that must be prevented, in the name of maintaining a good encyclopedia, and we'll do what it takes to prevent them. Spurious AfD's aren't so bad, unless it becomes a pattern, and then people start to notice, and something gets done. That last one he started, about the Scottish band, will be [[WP:SNOW|SNOW]]ball closed quite soon, I'm sure. Maybe I'll close it myself... -
[GTBacchus]: No problem! -
[GTBacchus]: I base it on the arguments made in the discussion, as I said. I certainly didn't see consensus for a move, nor do I see your reading of the guidelines to be unequivocal. If you disagree with my decision, I suggest taking the question to a wider audience. If it becomes clear that I made a bad call, I'll accept that. -
[GTBacchus]: [[Wikipedia talk:Requested moves]] might be a good place to try. -
[GTBacchus]: Well, if it doesn't make any practical difference, I'm certainly willing to agree that I didn't articulate my reading of the argument very well. I think \""Georgina\"" is used a lot more as a woman's name than as the name of a town in Ontario. That's different from \""Paris\"", despite Miss Hilton's popularity. It might be more accurate to say that there is no primary usage, because the use as a name isn't really singular, but many usages taken together. <p> At any rate, [[Georgina]] now points to a dab page. Is that appropriate, in your opinion, or should it redirect to the town, or should something else happen? -
[GTBacchus]: That was a direct reaction to Mindmatrix's statement: \""''If you disagree with current policy, then discuss it at the relevant policy pages, not here. Discussion on this page should reflect current policy, not personal opinion. If you disagree with my analysis, please explain why based on current policy.''\"" He's incorrect to argue that way; that's the opposite of how Wikipedia works. General policies are determined by decisions made on a case-by-case basis, not the other way around. -
[GTBacchus]: I understand your point here. Adding up the uses of the name doesn't make sense. I guess it's kind of a lazy way of saying that the town may be the only thing truly called \""Georgina\"", but it has so little individual weight that it makes sense to declare \""No primary use\"". If we were talking in the abstract, it'd be one thing, but I don't think a simple plurality is enough to warrant Primary Use status, complete w\/ redirect. I think more readers will be served by the dab page. -
[GTBacchus]: Which I guess makes this kind of a moot point, but you're right to point out that the rationale I typed wasn't very clear. I'm happier, as a writer, with what I've typed above. I think my instinct knew it at the time better than my words did. -
[GTBacchus]: You needn't tell me how AfD works. I don't speedy close for fun, or for no reason. That article was, in my opinion, a liability to the project as it existed, and we're better without it. It was worse than a nonsense article or a vanity page. The only possible outcome of the discussion other than deletion would be to start from scratch, and that's possible now. <p> Not all AfD's run for 5 days, and that's always been true. <p> All of that said, since you questioned my close, I'll post at [[WP:AN]] for review. I don't want to be getting things wrong. -
[GTBacchus]: And here it is: [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard#Request review of speedy close]]. -
[GTBacchus]: That's taken care of now. -
[GTBacchus]: You know, the people who work on these radio station articles are quite consistent, and these requests cross through the Uncontroversial Proposals desk without any trouble. If you disagree with the way they're handling the naming of radio station articles, I suggest you take it up at the project talk page, [Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Radio Stations]. Arguing it out over particular articles is pointless, because we're talking about a general practice here. For now, I'm gonna trust [[WP:WPRS]], because they've been doing good work on these articles for a long time. <p> 19.125.109.102, I'm not going to tell you to back off business you don't understand; but I will suggest that you take your dispute to an appropriate venue, which in this case is the talk page link I've given you. -
[GTBacchus]: So... are you unhappy with the decision implemented, or are you just addressing the rationale I gave in closing the discussion? The decision was to leave the page where it is. By any name, that's what happened. <p> I generally close those discussions in one of two ways: \""page moved\"", or \""no consensus to move.\"" In this case, it seemed best to leave the article where it was. Thus: \""no consensus to move.\"" It came down to the argument that more of the English language sources seem to call it \""Libingan ng mga Bayani.\"" That makes it a foreign name that tends to be used in English, much like the cited comparison, ''[[Cos\xec fan tutte]]''. <p> The policy on naming is that we follow reliable English language sources. (This is also a major content policy.) If the policy ''page'' says something that seems to contradict that, then it may be that the policy ''page'' is wrong. That can happen sometimes. <p> If you'd like, I can ask that my decision be reviewed by a larger audience. Just let me know. -
[GTBacchus]: Ah, that's a good catch. You're absolutely right, that we'll need to rewrite that section from sources, so it's got a visible history. I'll pull it out of the article now, and start a talk page section. Thanks for bringing this to my attention. -
[GTBacchus]: Have you considered a [[WP:RFC\/U|request for commment]]? -
[GTBacchus]: I have to go away for a few hours now, but I want to reply to this post. I'll get back to you after I do some mathematics :) -
[GTBacchus]: No problem, cheers. -
[GTBacchus]: You're right. Keeping cool under fire ''is'' difficult. Many worthwhile things are difficult. The most worthwhile things are nearly impossible. When you give in to frustration, and express your anger towards another editor, it undermines your effectiveness. I'm sorry that's true, but it's true. I am ready to help you, a lot, to deal with this editor. However, the only way I can help you is by teaching you effective strategies, and the first lesson is that you will never be effective while allowing yourself to stray into personal comments. I didn't make that true, but it's true. <p> Editors such as Badagnani, who seems tendentious, ''can'' be dealt with effectively. Let me show you how. Let me help you. <p> As for whether the discussion is necessary, don't underestimate the value of getting the arguments into clear, focused text on the talk page. The discussion may not be necessary for you, or for him, or for me, but we're not the intended audience. The people we need to communicate with are the next 50 editors who come along. They have to be able to separate the important, relevant, source-based arguments from the personal conflict. Your job is to make that easy for them, by (a) Omitting '''all''' personal content, (b) Explaining the source-based and policy-based arguments in a focused way, and (c) maintaining an extreme level of professionalism, courtesy and focus, thus making outsiders ''want'' to take your side. <p> If you are seen as the gentleman, and he's making racist remarks, they're almost certain to agree with you. They'll revert for you - more likely if you refrain from reverting, on principle. Once you're both reverting, and once accusations start going both ways, very many outsiders will simply see you both as part of a viper pit of POV-warriors. The truth won't matter. Their perceptions will matter entirely. Think about those perceptions, every time you post. -
[GTBacchus]: I knew it was going to be a controversial close either way. The argument that I found most persuasive was the fact that, if you search Google Books or Google Scholar, then the band drops way down the list, and Dio Chrysostom shoots way up to the top. Simply counting Google hits is one thing, but if you restrict your search to sources that are more encyclopedic, then you get a very different picture. <p> That said, the title you gave to this section is \""Question\"", but it's not clear to me what your question is. If there's something you want me to answer, please let me know, and I'll do my best to do so. I'm also going to post at [[WP:AN]] for my decision to be reviewed, because I do that whenever I have a move decision questioned. -
[GTBacchus]: You're welcome. -
[GTBacchus]: [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard#Request review of page move decision]]. -
[GTBacchus]: You'll find that I don't think of Wikipedia in terms of rules. I authored the original version of [[WP:WIARM]], which is the closest thing we've got to an official explanation of the policy [[Wikipedia:Ignore all rules]]. If you grok what's on that page, then you'll have a pretty good idea of how I approach Wikipedia. I tend not to read policy pages, nor to be impressed when people quote them. <p> I agree that it makes sense to leave an NPOV tag on a page when there are disputes regarding the neutrality. I would probably replace an NPOV tag that someone removed when there was still a neutrality dispute. That doesn't change what I said at [[Talk:Abortion]], which is that, if the tag is removed (and replaced or not), we'll end up back on that talk page discussing it. <p> Sure, it's the nature of an NPOV tag that it takes a consensus to declare \""no dispute\"". I just kind of don't care about tags; they're ephemeral. When there's a dispute, we've got to talk about it. That has to happen with or without the tag in place. If it makes people happy to keep the tag up, I'll help keep it up, but please realize that these considerations are extremely artificial. The dispute over the article is what's real; the NPOV tag is a flag that we can raise and lower at will. It's not what matters. What's allowed at Wikipedia, eventually, is whatever you can get people to agree to. <p> '''If''' using a hide-and-show format turns out to be the best solution, then that fact will trump your [[WP:SCROLL]], which is nothing more than words on a page. That's a very big \""if\"", but remember: reality always trumps policy. Therefore, making reality do what you want is a much more important skill than making policy do what you want. <p> To very directly address the point at hand: if you add an NPOV tag, I support that, and I would be inclined to replace it if someone removes it, arguing that there truly is a neutrality dispute. However, I won't edit war, and I won't use my admin buttons to gain advantage in a dispute in which I'm involved. -
[GTBacchus]: Yeah.... telling editors that they're breaking rules almost never helps a situation. If you have trouble with people deleting material against consensus, why don't you tell me where the problem is, and maybe I can help out? It is generally a good strategy to bring outside parties to a dispute, and let more eyes see the problem.  -
[GTBacchus]: I absolutely have never accused you of failing to AGF. I haven't even mentioned it. My insistence that there is a better approach has ''nothing'' to do with AGF, and everything to do with dry, cold pragmatics. Pragmatically, you win more by making fewer accusations. Counter-intuitive but true. Forget AGF. You're here to WIN. Win by being pragmatic. <p> You disagree with my approach to Badagnani, but that has nothing to do with my objectivity. My expectations vary from person to person in accordance with what I've seen of them. I strongly suspect that Badagnani hasn't got much time left on Wikipedia, and you'll note that you already have my support at the RFC. Convincing Badagnani to change requires that someone extend a hand to him. I'm willing to be that hand. It may be a one-in-a-million shot, and I won't complain if he gets banned before he hears a damn word I say, but I'm going to extend that hand. Partly, I'm just an optimist. Partly, I'm also trying to lead by example, and show that in the long run, the only effective weapon against tendentious editors is unfailing professionalism and smart dispute resolution. Partly, it's helpful to have someone playing \""[[good cop]]\"" sometimes. -
[GTBacchus]: Hey, guys. If you're not talking to me, please take the conversation elsewhere. Thanks. Caspian, I look forward to seeing how you practice ''de-escalation'' with Badagnani. Any other approach - outside of the regular dispute resolution process - would not be very helpful. -
[GTBacchus]: That may be, Caspian, but neither you nor I controls Badagnani. De-escalation is the responsibility of whoever decides to be responsible. There's a situation, and an opportunity to make it better. Take that or don't. Learn how to better handle people like Badagnani, and your whole life will improve. We're working on Badagnani in the RfC. Working on your own reactions to hostile editors is ''your'' job. -
[GTBacchus]: That's true, and others replied before I had the chance, it seems. I apologize for that. <p> When you're troubled by other editors, the best thing to do is to respond '''only regarding article content'''. If there are personal attacks, ignore them. If they try to make the topic personal, then you be the one who insists on professionalism. <p> If people make it hard for you to edit, then seek outside opinions, but '''don't accuse the people of anything'''. Seek outside opinions about '''the edits'''. When outside people come to observe, if there are behavior problems, they'll notice. You don't have to accuse anyone of anything. If someone's behavior is clearly a chronic problem, and you know that other people have noticed it, then an RFC may be appropriate. <p> In summary, my answer is that it's fine to respond, as long as you rigidly limit your response to dry talk about the edits. No accusations, no exaggeration, no emotional language. Remaining professional is incredibly powerful, much more powerful than fighting. <p> Remember focus on the edits, ignore the personalities, and resolve conflicts by bringing more people to look at the edits. -
[GTBacchus]: I wouldn't say that you're \""not permitted to point out\"" difficult behavior. I would say that pointing it out directly to the person, via an accusation or warning, is a ''terrible'' idea, because it makes the situation worse, not better. That's unless you can warn someone so tactfully that they accept your criticism and take it as a friendly note. At that point, you're a true diplomat, and I have nothing more to tell you! <p> The best thing to do is to treat each dispute as a content dispute. In those terms, you can ask others to look, and then trust that people will notice behavior patterns. If you're consistently the one talking patiently about edits, and someone else is consistently the one making personal remarks, then you'll end up obtaining more support, and whoever is making personal attacks will just look bad. <p> Now, if you can point me to an article where a conflict is happening, I'll have a look at it, and probably weigh in with some opinion. If you do this a few times, and we start to notice that the same editor is making spurious arguments about your contributions, then we can look at addressing that behavior issue. We can't address the behavior issue though, until we can separate it from the content dispute, and that can't happen unless ''someone'' focuses on the content. <p> So, which article are you thinking of? Pick any one. -
[GTBacchus]: Badagnani, you need to stop worrying about that, stop talking about that, and let the process work. You will never win until you put 100% of your energy to edits, and 0% to personal stuff. Forget those policies, and edit with me. We'll take care of the bad behavior. Don't worry. Be calm, be patient, and talk to me about liqueurs. -
[GTBacchus]: Wikipedia policy ''is'' important. However, there is a necessity to work '''effectively'''. Dealing with the behavior policies as you have been doing is not '''effective'''. In fact, it is very counter-productive, and it can get people banned. <p> If you just trust me a little bit, and watch how I enforce behavior policies, I think you might be surprised. I need you to help me do it, though, by doing as I suggest. Please trust me. You can be a ''much'' more productive editor if you learn some better conflict skills. Will you at least give me a chance to show you? -
[GTBacchus]: You must not have noticed that I've been responding to those who report you in precisely the same way I've been responding to you. If that's not even-handed... what both sides of the dispute need to realize is that we've got two choices: We either talk about each other, or we talk about edits. If we're here to talk about each other, then the project means nothing. <p> Also, recall that an RFC is not a formal \""report\"" of any kind. It's a group of people, making comments. <p> What I'm trying to do is to help '''resolve''' the problematic relations, but that can '''only''' be done in the venue of talking about edits. Please talk to me about edits, Badagnani. Please? Show me how you collaborate, already. <p> If you trust me, the behavior part will follow naturally, and you will see the policies enforced, okay? -
[GTBacchus]: Badagnani, be calm. The content won't go far, and people won't die as a result of not knowing about some brand of liqueur. I strongly suggest that you make note of the content that is missing, help me put together your case, like I've been trying to get you to do, and focus on one article. Please, can we do that? This is how you will win. Trust me. You have to slow down and focus, in order to win. Can you do that? -
[GTBacchus]: I enforce the Wikihounding, once it is clear to me exactly what's going on. You're not making it very easy for me to figure that out, because instead of presenting me with the information that I can use to defend you, you avoid my questions. It makes enforcement very difficult, when you seem to expect that I will do it blindly, without looking into the situation. I draw my own judgements as to when someone is being Wikihounded. I thank you in advance for respecting my ability to do that, and for providing clearer answers to my attempts to gather information. -
[GTBacchus]: You haven't breathed a word about how you know there is consensus for your links. Not one. I am completely even-handed, asking anyone who wishes to add links to commercial sites how they know they have consensus. I'm still asking. Name three editors who agree with your edits. Who makes up this consensus? -
[GTBacchus]: You're telling me the same thing, over and over again, and it's not an answer to my question. I agree that they're hounding you, but I can't do anything about it unless you help me. You have to explain to me how we know that most Wikipedians support your edits. How do we know that? How can I tell what the consensus thinks? You tell me about people hounding you, but I want to know what the Wikipedia community at large thinks of your links in the [[List of liqueurs]] article. This is the very important question you must answer: where  is the evidence that your links are supported by the community. Find it, and show it to me. Do you understand? -
[GTBacchus]: Look, there's a problem here. I can only defend you in terms of edits, so if you won't talk to me about those, then it is ''very'' difficult for me to help you, understand? Now, the hounding is a problem. I can help you address it, but it has to be done my way. If you don't like my way, get someone else to help you. You'll find that I'm willing to do a lot on your behalf, but you have to do your part. <p> Are you willing to do this? -
[GTBacchus]: I will enforce against it, if you let me '''do it my way'''. Right now, you're in the way. You have to cooperate with me, or I '''cannot''' help. I only work my way, and I'm very effective. If you want my help, it's on my terms. Take it, or leave it. -
[GTBacchus]: I can help you, but only if you explain to me how I can know that your links at [[List of liqueurs]] truly are supported by most Wikipedians. I know that we have a long-standing policy not to link to commercial websites. In order to make an exception to this policy, we need to confirm a broad-consensus for that exception. How can we prove that most Wikipedians agree with your edits? <p> You have said nothing about what Wikipedians think about external links. You've told me that you think they're very useful, but '''does the community agree''' that we should use them in that way? This question has not been answered. If the community does not support such linking, then we can do nothing about that edit, no matter about the hounding. I can only defend edits that are supported by the community. Do you understand? Are you willing to work my way, or not? If you want my help, then we have to focus on edits, not on hounding. No negotiation, no exception. Do you agree? -
[GTBacchus]: What don't you understand? I'll break it down: I can help you in 1 way. It's not what you're expecting. You have to trust me, and do what I ask. If you do, then after some time, the hounding will end, because we will deal with it. <p> That's the only way I can help you, so you either have to agree to trust me, or there's nothing else to talk about. If you want someone to simply yell at those editors, or revert to your version, then '''ask another admin'''. There are hundreds. <p> I will help you, in a way that you may not even imagine, but only if you agree to put the hounding question \""on hold\"", and do as I say. Otherwise, I can't help you. I'm sorry. I only work one way, and I'm very effective. If you agree to work my way, you will be very pleasantly surprised. Otherwise... I guess I'm not the admin you were looking for. -
[GTBacchus]: Can you please provide links when you say this kind of stuff? I'm working on it, but I also have, like, a job and a life. Christ... -
[GTBacchus]: Viriditas' attitude is indeed very strange. I don't know where he's coming from. Let me look into those other links you posted. Thank you for bringing them to my attention, along with your vote of no confidence. -
[GTBacchus]: I'll form my own opinions about who is or isn't a troll, thanks. If you can read minds, then I have to say you're very bad at it. I consider Badagnani to be an ''extremely'' good faith editor with very badly misguided ideas about how to interact with others in a collaborative editing environment. If you say \""troll\"" then you're claiming you can read his mind. I'll bet $100 that you can't. <p> Replying to your point, it's certainly not your duty to police any articles that do not hold interest for you. If you could let me know about any situations that may arise with the cuisine articles, I'd appreciate that. Take care. -
[GTBacchus]: I agree that the behavior is seriously problematic. It will change, or he will be banned. Now he's got lots of eyes on him. I'm not going to wander off, and others are watching, too. I tend to be a last-chance admin sometimes. It may take a week or two, but I do what I do. I don't do it like a cowboy, and I think that's good. <p> Meanwhile, I'll point out that any amount of reasoning about another editor's motivations is worth precisely nothing. It will never advance your position in an argument, it will never make him go away faster, and it will never improve the encyclopedia. It will, however, make it take longer to do the effective work that needs to be done. Fact of life. -
[GTBacchus]: You want to use it as the top picture? -
[GTBacchus]: I really don't like the idea that the hide\/show rule is absolute. I know what the argument for it is, but that doesn't make it absolute. These things are not laws, and they're not meant to be interpreted technically. The coding thing is clearly not a problem, because we're surrounded by people who know that code. Why don't you post a link at the talk page, and see what other people think? -
[GTBacchus]: Fair enough, regarding infoboxes. I don't actually know what's going on with that rule, because there's something technical about infoboxes that make it make sense. If I understood that, I could say something more intelligent. The jargon issue could be resolved most simply with words, I suspect. I think finding someone who is willing to immediately code up a hide\/show box on Wikipedia is a roughly 30 second task. I'd be perfectly happy to do that legwork, and get them to teach me about it at the same time. Even so, I don't think we're in a hurry, are we? <p> I'm certainly willing to take the idea to the talk page. -
[GTBacchus]: Yes, I was just reading about that now. -
[GTBacchus]: I'm moving this here because it's very awkward for me to find that other section in the middle of my page, and it's especially awkward when you post to the middle of it. Please try to communicate with me in a reasonably recent section here, when you can. I'd appreciate that. -
[GTBacchus]: I don't know. The word \""plastered\"" is a bit prejudicial. I'd rather talk about shocking images in a more detached manner. I think the idea is that we want to be where people can come to find out. If an image of a beheading is necessary to illuminate the subject, then we should have a picture of it. If a picture of necrophilia would somehow helpfully illuminate the subject, then we should have a picture of that. I would be very surprised to see a picture that would meet the standard, on either of those topics. At autofellatio, the argument was that it's a bit of a contortion, and it is therefore a question whether it's actually possible. The photo proves that it is. I don't think there's any doubt that beheadings or necrophilia are physically possible. -
[GTBacchus]: I don't know, Badagnani's behavior that I've observed is pretty problematic, whether or not the editors pursuing him are involved. He's been extremely uncooperative with me, and absolutely refuses to even consider the idea that he should respect consensus. If he's adding spammy commercial links to articles, then those reverting him are doing good work. Your case for \""harassment\"" will be pretty laughable unless you can show that they've reverted anything worthwhile. You refused to take up that question with me, which tells me that you don't actually know of any good work of his that's been reverted. Either that, or you're just choosing to be uncooperative. I don't really care which it is, I'm ignoring you on this topic until I see you say anything useful. Thanks for understanding. -
[GTBacchus]: What do you want to do, convince me that it's okay to hide some pictures? Why? I'm not the person you need to convince. If I were... I wouldn't buy that \""a contortion of the human mind\"" line. <p> Regarding the abortion drawing, that doesn't boggle my mind at all. They're obeying their consciences just as you or I would. -
[GTBacchus]: Really? <p> I'm sorry, I was in a mood earlier. My own world-view tends to the idea that everyone is pursuing the Good, as they see it. How could anyone do otherwise? (Plato asked this question, and I still think he was right.) If someone has a very different notion of Good than I do, it might be hard for me to believe that a conscience is prompting their actions, but I've been wrong enough times to stop guessing. I've certainly never gotten to know someone who wasn't clearly pursuing the Good, as they understand it. Some people are pretty broken, but everyone's got a Good in mind. If not, then... nothing I believe makes any sense. -
[GTBacchus]: Oh, I wish I'd known there was an objection. The page entered the backlog at [[Wikipedia:Requested moves]] because five days had passed, and the only discussion at the talk page favored the move. I'm happy enough to move it back, but I'd like to be certain I won't have to reverse it ''again''. Is there any way we can establish that, and then any further page moves can be the last we make for a long time? -
[GTBacchus]: <-- (Outdenting) I'm not ignoring you; I've just been a bit busy. Grad school and all. I will attempt to insert the image tomorrow, when I have a very clear head, and some hours free to respond to the fallout. -
[GTBacchus]: You've edited it just as much as he has. If you're both edit-warring, why should I help you and not him? If you want me to do something, give me links showing that Ronz is repeatedly reverting to the same version. Also, if you want help from me, show that you've taken the initiative of bringing up the dispute on the talk page. On the talk page, describe the content dispute calmly and independently of the behavior issues. When you've done that stuff, let me know. <p> If you want an admin to play cop, and write the other guy a ticket, then you don't want me, cause I don't roll that way. All I do is dispute ''resolution''. -
[GTBacchus]: My Internet was down for a day. Now it's back; no idea why. -
[GTBacchus]: I don't read guidelines. What I was trying to do with that section was put my finger on the exact point where Badagnani seems to be disagreeing with others. I only used his name because he's been the only person arguing for his edit. After many rounds of discussion, I ''think'' I know what he's claiming and what I'm claiming, and I think they're both reasonable positions that a sane and sober person my hold. <p> I would like to find out what a larger cross-section of the community thinks of the principle that Badagnani is applying, but before doing that, I thought it would be advisable to be sure that I'm stating his position correctly. Does that make sense? -
[GTBacchus]: Policies are doubly avoided. I also refuse to recognize the distinction between the two. It's okay, I'm trained in paradox-swallowing. -
[GTBacchus]: Ronz, what I said to the anon below, is equally directed to you. Those are my conditions for helping. I should post this somewhere permanent, I reckon. -
[GTBacchus]: You know, if you tell me I've violated WP:ACRONYM, I'm likely to say I don't read guidelines. If you tell me I'm being a jerk to another editor, I'm likely to listen to you, take a critical look at my behavior, and respond thoughtfully. I'm a little surprised that you, knowing who I am, would approach me with guidelines and policies instead of ordinary talk. <p> I have, as you've no doubt noticed, changed the section title, which was never intended to offend anyone. I continue to welcome your input on the larger issue. -
[GTBacchus]: I appreciate your concern, and thanks also for the vote of confidence. I think I made a mistake the other evening. What I was looking for was a calm place to edit and get away from the stres of events elsewhere in the 'Pedia. Choosing [[Talk:Abortion]] as a nice cozy place to relax may have been folly, or at least not very well thought-out. <p> It's hard for me to predict where my interest will lead me to edit or discuss, but I am a bit drawn in by the image question. I will generally be in a better mood than I was the other day. <p> Cheers. -
[GTBacchus]: Precisely. What I did wasn't feeding; what you did, was. The proof is in the pudding. Let me do it my way, and see if he keeps coming back. That ''was'' the effect of your approach - he kept coming back. You encouraged him. <p> I think you should stop encouraging them. They seek to get a rise out of you. When you call them \""troll\"", they win. Please stop making them win. -
[GTBacchus]: Thank you very much! :) -
[GTBacchus]: Well, maybe we'll get a clear reply from one of them, and figure out what's really going on. -
[GTBacchus]: I might do this. Thank you. :) -
[GTBacchus]: Huh. That's a lot to respond to. What do you think of what I've been saying, about the practical expediency of using rhetoric that is likely to convince people? I don't think I've seen you address that issue. Did I miss it? <p> I tend to think that extra links on disambiguation pages are deprecated for a good reason, and I refrain from using them. The argument that convinced me is that disambiguation pages are not articles, and they serve precisely one purpose: to get someone to the article that they were actually looking for in the first place. What do you find unconvincing about that argument? -
[GTBacchus]: Another reply: \""''as you might know, very little is decided in \""public forums\"" while the real changes happen in the \""[[backroom]]\"" with separate private conversations with each person involved''\"". I do not know this to be true. Decisions in which I am involved seem to be discussed publicly, on talk pages. If there is a whole layer of behind-the-scenes decision making, I have no part in it, nor wish to. I think it's best to discuss policy issues in the relevant forums. -
[GTBacchus]: Oh, wow. That's weird. I didn't get any special message moving it. Anyway, cheers! -
[GTBacchus]: My experience disagrees with your assessment. I've seen way too many people use \""emphatic\"" language, as you call it, and come to grief on Wikipedia. I've also seen a lot of people learn that more conciliatory rhetoric is their friend, and they end up being very successful here. You can ignore that, or you can take it on-board. -
[GTBacchus]: Yeah... I don't see a problem that needs solving here. I've replied at the guideline talk page. You can say all you like about backrooms, but I personally stay out of them. -
[GTBacchus]: One other reply: \""''In the world at large, many people have learned that others often become defensive in public forums, and decisions cannot be effectively reached.''\"" I have found that people in public forums become defensive precisely in proportion to the extremeness of the rhetoric used. I have been very successful, in public Wikipedia spaces, avoiding the defensiveness reaction by speaking in ways that people don't interpret as needing defense against. The rhetoric with which you introduced your topic at the MOS talk page was ''very'' likely to provoke a defensive reaction. You might consider presenting your ideas differently. My experience indicates that you'll see a lot less defensiveness if you moderate your own tone. -
[GTBacchus]: I certainly didn't mean to imply that, and I'm not certain the sentence does so, but I'll reword it, since it bothers you. -
[GTBacchus]: Well, the ones who aren't disruptive, you don't know about, right? That's what it's like under the radar. Wikipedia is full of people who have terrible collaboration skills, but who manage not to offend enough people severely enough to cause real trouble. I mean, this guy's been around for years. Has he caused \""way more harm than good,\"" before someone complained about that picture? If so, I haven't seen the evidence. <p> Did you read that article, like, yesterday, about a study that showed that people who contribute to Wikipedia tend to have poor social skills, and don't contribute out of altruism? Now I wish I could remember where I found that link. <p> I can think of three or four users off the top of my head (ok, 5 or 6) who are complete assholes, but who generally stick to WikiGnoming, so it isn't a problem. (Having put it that way, I'd rather not name names publicly.) <p> As for \""ineptitude,\"" I'm not sure what you see as \""inept\"" about the user in question. I think he's a jerk, but I don't see that he's an idiot. What do you mean by \""inept\""? -
[GTBacchus]: Heh, good call. That actually ''is'' the direction the article went, saying that many Wikipedia contributors do not feel empowered in normal social settings, and try to attain that here instead. I've been told by more than one editor in the last couple of weeks that they're here for themselves, no more. I hear it, and I'd like to block them and throw away the key, but I don't think that's a tenable solution. They are, after all, making good edits, a lot of the time. I just try to give them a wide berth, and when I have to interact with them, I put on my best professional face and try to take the inevitable abuse gracefully. <p> There's a skill that we never really talk about here, but it would be a good one to see more of. I'm thinking of diplomacy, basically. There's a way to ask someone to do something so that they want to do it, and think they're being really cool by doing it, rather than thinking someone has just forced them into something they don't want. People who can do this well are very powerful in the world. I don't know how we can encourage more diplomacy in the interactions here. It's a cultural change, and those are hard to bring about. -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks for the feedback. I don't know how much of that interaction you got to witness, but I was extremely insulted by that editor's treatment of myself, and I admit that I posted at least once or twice in frustration, which is never a good idea. I started out with a much more conciliatory tone, but after being insulted a few times, I was a bit combative. If you want someone to help you, then imperiously telling them how to do their job is a terrible idea. <p> My one previous interaction with that user didn't help. He was making blatantly racist insults on a talk page, and I asked him to stop. He responded by laughing in my face, and telling me that we make racist comments all the time, and that I must be a newbie or a fool. Then I told him I was an admin of three years, and he got ''very'' quiet. That's a bad way to give a first impression, don't you agree? <p> As for the \""ill intent\"" or \""lack of good sense\"" in the other editors, I can't speak to that too directly, because I can't read their minds. The faults I saw in them were entirely parallel and comparable to similar faults in the one editor, and in a situation such as that, my conscience does not allow me to say that one side is \""right\"" and the other \""wrong\"". I took his side as best I could, but he continued to spit in my face, over and over again. How many times would you take it? <p> I have made comments (including today) to the editors you mention, and I hope you don't imagine that I'm turning a blind eye to provocative behavior from anyone. I simply cannot see the situation as a \""good guys\"" and \""bad guys\"" issue. If you have any position of trust with that editor, perhaps you can let him know that dictatorially demanding that an admin do what he says is a very, very, very foolish and bad idea. It leads directly to sadness, 100% of the time. We're humans, it turns out, and we're not being paid for this. <p> Also \u2014 and this is my experience in life, perhaps yours is different \u2014 The more someone repeats a statement about themselves, the less likely that it's true. Insisting repeatedly that one is an important and valuable contributor is very likely (100%) to convince people that one is ''not''. Again, if the editor listens to you, and if you agree, then maybe you can pass that on. -
[GTBacchus]: You may be right. I think your advice to yourself is excellent. -
[GTBacchus]: Well, you may consider yourself welcome to copyedit ''my'' text; I'm not bothered by it. Of course, under the present circumstances, I can see why you'd refrain. -
[GTBacchus]: Ah, so it's not your place to correct another editor's grammar and spelling (I agree), but it is your place to leave drive-by insults on ANI? I notice you didn't actually respond to the content of my note. You changed the subject. ChildofMidnight is ''not'' the one being uncivil in this situation, at least not the part I can see. You get your own house in order, then criticize others. -
[GTBacchus]: Oh, and you ''just'' said you would steer clear of this editor. Bald-faced lie, much? Don't post here again, please, unless you grow up first. -
[GTBacchus]: That user will not become an admin (sorry, CoM, but that's my prediction); you needn't worry about it, silly boy. I'm absolutely uninterested in whatever you're talking about. I can judge editors around here by my own standards; thank you very much. Run along now. -
[GTBacchus]: You see, here's the trouble. Consider an admin who doesn't really know the details of the case. When they look into it, it's not remotely clear who is the good editor, and who is harassing whom. It might seem very clear to you, in the thick of it, but from someone else's perspective, you're the troll. Once both sides have called each other \""troll\"", we might as well give up on writing, and just go roll around in the mud together. Splish splash. <p> No admin will \""take on that gang\"" as long as you and they seem equally tendentious and equally disruptive. How can I tell that you're right and they're wrong? If you step back and take a long view of the situation, you'll realize that it looks quite symmetric from the outside. I certainly can't tell that they're a \""gang\"" and you're an innocent. I see mud flying in all directions, and I associate good editors with a lack of mud. <p> I do hope that you'll consider my offer to mediate disputes with these people ''at the content level''. If you trust me enough to do that, then your complaints at the behavior level will take care of themselves. <p> If you really can't find an admin to \""take on that gang\"", there might be a good reason for that. Admins who play \""policeman\"" tend to be terrible admins, and we tend to get rid of them. Wikipedia has no cops, and the best way to handle personal disputes is at the content level. Then you've got both feet planted firmly in the encyclopedia, and that's where your power flows from. This is just what I've noticed. Some people don't believe this... -
[GTBacchus]: Pick an article to start with, and point me to it. We'll work on it together. I'm not much longer for this evening, but I'll be around over the weekend, and I seldom get very far away. -
[GTBacchus]: Well, you haven't made it clear that you're any less of a mudslinger, from what I've seen. Since you're confident that you're right, you should welcome my offering to take a look at the articles and get to the bottom of this. -
[GTBacchus]: Also, don't assume that anyone in particular has my support or empathy, I view every single one of you as infinitely valuable expressions of the divine, and I also view every single one of you with extreme caution. If you try and guess what I'm up to, you've got a very high probability of being wrong. I surprise people. -
[GTBacchus]: As far as the \""gang\"" language, I'll adress people in the language that I think will get the point to them most easily and quickly. I do '''not''' consider you to be part of a gang, but sometimes, I have to speak different languages to different people. I hope that's understandable. -
[GTBacchus]: As for the single editor with the single viewpoint... '''please take me to your content dispute!''' Since you're right (see, I'm speaking your language now), show me. Show me the money! -
[GTBacchus]: So you mean, [[Barack Obama]], [[Barney Frank]], and [[Drudge Report]]? If ArbCom's already looking at the president, why don't we have a look at one of those others? [[Barney Frank]] it is then. One advantage is that I've never heard of the guy, and I find it easy to be pretty neutral about topics that I don't give a shit about. Meet me at the talk page there? You too, Midnight! -
[GTBacchus]: Actually... is this an active dispute, Wikidemon? I don't see CoM editing the article ''or'' talk page for over a week. If there's not an active dispute, except for the one in ArbCom... then what is all this about? I'm looking at the history of [[Drudge Report]], and I see him editing constructively and collaboratively... -
[GTBacchus]: [[Illegal immigration to the United States]], eh? Let's have a look. I've got a good hour left in me tonight. -
[GTBacchus]: I may have been born in Texas, and I may live here now, but I moved from Seattle, the gayest city in America. I think it might have passed San Francisco the year they couldn't decide whether to hold the pride parade in the traditional gay district or downtown.... so they did both. Before that, I lived in Portland, where you're not considered very cool if you aren't a lesbian. Good ol' west coast... -
[GTBacchus]: You seem to bounce around IP addresses a lot. Is there a reason you don't set up an account? I'm not suggesting you should; just asking. It actually gives you greater anonymity, in the sense that people can't figure out that you're posting from... Massachusetts? Am I right? -
[GTBacchus]: Bet I've got more. :{)}}} (<--- attempt at mustachioed and bearded smiley) -
[GTBacchus]: I'm reading through some article history and talk page discussion. If you could summarize for me your primary issue with the content of the article, that would be very helpful; thanks. -
[GTBacchus]: Finally, there's this: I can only help you if you accept my condition. That condition is that you'll talk about the article content only, and allow me to determine for myself whatever I need to know about other editors' behavior. If you're willing to do that, then I can ''probably'' help you. My initial impression on that talk page is that it's worth looking further into. -
[GTBacchus]: Fair enough. So it appears your issue with the article relates to the possible involvement of the government of Mexico in helping Mexicans cross the border illegally into the US, right? I'll post a question at the talk page, and see what people say. I suspect we can get it unprotected, because I'm working with you, and you've agreed to drop the personal side, at least for now. -
[GTBacchus]: Hi. I've been approached by the IP editor, and I've agreed to look into the dispute on this page. I see that the talk page is semi-protected now. If the IP editor agrees to refrain from commenting on other editors, would it be possible to lift the semi-protection? I think maybe I can help resolve the dispute; it's certainly not a topic that I care enough about to be biased. -
[GTBacchus]: Yeah. On my talk page, he(she?) said he was stalked when he had one, so he stopped using it. Now, the IP addresses jump around because he's editing from a phone. I'm comfortable working with anonymous editors. -
[GTBacchus]: Sure. I agree that it's a awesomely hilarious article. What a long way to spell \""durian,\"" right? -
[GTBacchus]: Ah, it looks like Bigtimepeace beat me to it. -
[GTBacchus]: The reason for my condition I set is that I'm actually pretty good at determining disruptive behavior. It'll be clear to me who's abusive and who isn't. However, if come in on someone's side, I lose my powers. I've got the article on my watchlist, and I've already begun a conversation on the talk page. Let's see what happens. -
[GTBacchus]: Yeah, I get similar kicks out of stub sorting. Sometimes, I've got no idea what an article's about, but I can tell it's happening in India. Thus: {{tl|India-stub}}! -
[GTBacchus]: I understand your reluctance to participate if you're going to be attacked. What you ask for is fair, and I do promise to defend your right to participate without being attacked. If you're talking about article content, and someone wants to mess with your comments, I've got your back. -
[GTBacchus]: Bugs... you have a strange notion of what's helpful. If you're going to make oblique references to \""certain users,\"" I'd actually appreciate your fucking off again. I don't talk about people that way, and I don't appreciate seeing that kind of talk. Shoot straight here: 100% honest, 100% above board, 100% helpful. No little digs at people. If you can't do that, then I don't welcome your input. This talk page is a respect zone. I failed to respect you on this talk page yesterday, and I apologize for that. I was upset, and that's never a good time to post. <p> Now, can you handle a \""no insult of any kind\"" policy here? I'll keep up my end, ok? -
[GTBacchus]: Thank you, Bugs, this was helpful. -
[GTBacchus]: Where was this back-handed attack? Will I find it when I click over to the talk page in a second here? -
[GTBacchus]: (edit conflicts with two previous posts) Will Beback, thanks for putting this information together. I'm concerned that it's slightly off-topic for this talk page. I've been communicating with this editor, and I'd like to offer some mediation in this dispute. Since I'm helping out, perhaps I can offer my talk page as a locale for discussion that doesn't directly relate to this article here? Please feel free to start a thread there, anytime. <p> On the evidence you've presented, I will make one remark here. That RfC is anything by damning. <p> Camaron, while this editor has agreed to certain conditions relating to this dispute, I think it's fair to note that they also feel a bit insulted and maligned by the way they've been talked about on this page. Now, I've got no interest in digging through the history to see who called whom a dirty birdy. However, in the interest of dispute resolution, I think it's fair to wipe the slate clean, all around, at least to see how it goes. <p> From what I ''have'' read in the history, I see our IP colleague making remarks that seem to stem pretty directly from frustration, and a feeling of being ganged up on. Whether or not you agree with that characterization of the situation, I think we all know how that feels. Therefore, I understand when he tells me on my talk page that your comment about \""turning over a new leaf\"" is a back-handed insult. I don't think you meant it that way. Sill, in the interest of moving forward, would be willing to strike it? Your doing so would acknowledge that we're not dealing with a criminal we need to reform, but with a frustrated person reacting to what he perceives as unfair treatment. Being frustrated, even to the point of lashing out, is something we've all done I suspect. -
[GTBacchus]: I've posted about it there, and the talk page is no longer semi-protected. Tread carefully though, until we've set up a good collaborative rapport with the page, okay? -
[GTBacchus]: I agree 100%. If you're not able to be funny without insulting or degrading anyone, you're not very clever. I work with people in disputes, who are upset. I'm more interested in de-escalating situations than in showing people up as insufficiently humorous. If you cannot separate sense of humor from lack of respect for others, that's sad. What do you think? If you cut out the gratuitous insults, will you still have a sense of humor left? I think you will. I think you're significantly better than you've been acting. -
[GTBacchus]: I've been away for a lot of today, but I'm back now. Let's have a look. -
[GTBacchus]: Believe it or not, I'm not here to get hung up in long-term drama. That's why I set a condition for helping the IP editor, that I would only do it if he leaves off all personal comments, and focuses on content. If he doesn't do that, then I'll leave you in peace. The only way I wish to resolve any dispute is by working alongside the parties, and helping keep the focus on improving the article. Is that a bad plan, or an okay one? -
[GTBacchus]: Camaron, I never said you attacked anyone. I didn't say I thought you insulted anyone. Why would you intentionally offend someone? I don't imagine you doing that. I did say that someone felt insulted. <p> If you're getting on a bus, and you accidentally step on someone's foot, do you refuse to apologize, because you didn't mean to step on them, and apologizing would be an admission of guilt? Personally, I say, \""excuse me, I didn't mean to do that.\"" When someone feels insulted by something I've said, I tend to say, \""I'm sorry, I didn't mean it as an insult.\"" Is that unreasonable behavior? <p> I won't say you have to do this or that \u2014 you remain true to yourself. My only goal here is to help get sort out a dispute with someone who asked me for help. I'm not asking people to walk on eggshells or become best friends. Small goodwill gestures can go a long way, and they don't cost a thing. -
[GTBacchus]: Well, he's already agreed to cut out the personal comments. What do you want? Can we work together here, or what? If he starts insulting people, I won't defend that behavior. Am I out of line here? -
[GTBacchus]: If \""turn over a new leaf\"" is really the worst insult we're talking about right now, I'd suggest that's a small enough matter to let it go. You feel insulted, but I'll guarantee you that others feel insulted as well, by you. Now you know you haven't been trying to insult people, and I'm comfortable with that, but if you've done it unintentionally... I think some small gesture of good will can go a long way. The article is more important than any of us is, right? -
[GTBacchus]: I certainly am not asking you to \""capitulate culpability\"", nor anything resembling that. You won't find it in my words. If you wish to stand on ceremony, and not participate until you get the right apology from the right person, then you'll remain standing there. I'm not going to twist someone's arm and force them to make nicer than they're willing. First of all, it wouldn't be effective, and second, it would make me a real jerk. <p> You either care more about the article, or more about your pride. I'm happy either way. The fact is, you were interlacing irrelevant and impolite remarks in your comments about the article right up until the end. If complaining about your posts being \""screwed with\"" is so important to you, then you can do that, and have no input on the article. If you wish to have input on the article, you'll get past all of this pride, drop the past, and pony up to the talk page with some serious, ''100% focused'' discussion. If you had followed that policy previously, you wouldn't be in this fix now. <p> I don't care one way or the other. I'll help you, if you'll be helped, but I won't stroke your wounded ego. What do you want more? You may shop around, but I think you'll find I'm more accommodating than most administrators would be. -
[GTBacchus]: I think the activity that has brought more people to grief on this site than any other is seeking justice from Wikipedia. People feel slighted, and they want those who wronged them to be somehow punished. This is an understandable desire, and maybe it's a weakness of Wikipedia, but... this site just isn't designed to do that. We've optimized our setup (to some extent) for writing an encyclopedia. As it turns out, trying to use an encyclopedia-writing construct (i.e., the software + the policies + the community) to attain justice ''doesn't work''. Maybe it would be cool if it did, but it doesn't. Admins aren't cops, and those who try to be cops are terrible admins. <p> When someone wants justice on Wikipedia, my best advice to them is to forget it. If you want a community where transgressions against you will be punished, start a wiki for that. If you want to contribute to the encyclopedia more than you want other things, then contribute here, and learn to use Wikipedia to your advantage. If you want satisfaction in a personal dispute, ground yourself in an intense focus on edits, and in a rigid policy of respect, professionalism and dignity. Work the dispute resolution process that I'll be delighted to show you... but I can't show you until you drop the hunt for justice. <p> If you do these things, you will find that your power multiplies a thousand-fold. After that... you end up getting the \""justice\"" you wanted, in the sense that you're empowered to deal effectively with problems from other editors. -
[GTBacchus]: So what do you want me to do? Make them change? How? I can't just start issuing blocks, you know. I'm no more empowered than Camaron? What do you want me to do? What do you want, justice? -
[GTBacchus]: Do you think I'm \""coddling vandals\""? Do you know what a vandal ''is''? It's someone who is trying to make Wikipedia worse \u2014 not better from their perspective. People who wish to improve the project, but have insufficient understanding of how to work well with others are not vandals. Calling them that is a ''great'' way to increase the ''drama!'' quotient. -
[GTBacchus]: I can see how you might see it that way. The editor answered above, in this section, your question: He felt he was being harassed. My suggestion would be a middle ground between anonymous editing and an account: use some kind of standard name to sign posts, in addition to the regular four-tilde sig. Would that be an improvement, in your mind? -
[GTBacchus]: Another point: I'm not attributing years-long issues to frustration. If you read that in what I said, you must have read it in, because I certainly didn't mean it. I'm simply pointing out that there is frustration, and that it doesn't hurt to recognize that. Do you think that's a bad idea? Do you think of the IP editor as a criminal, more or less? I sure don't, and I don't care what kind of poor dispute resolution skills he or anyone has displayed in the past. I work in the present, and in the present, the frustration level is ''actually'' kind of high. What's the best de-escalation strategy: Ignore that, or acknowledge it? -
[GTBacchus]: I think that the editor was seeking dispute resolution when he posted the message to the Village Pump that inititally got my attention. I think that, by posting to my talk page here, he's seeking dispute resolution. Meanwhile, he doesn't trust people around here much, and I don't blame him. If editing from an IP does no harm, and it makes him feel better, then I'm okay with it. I suspect we'll see what he thinks of leaving personally identifiable signatures. -
[GTBacchus]: Well of course I haven't commented on that. What would be the point? Going back into the history to decide who was wrong when? That's not helpful. I'm not remotely interested in identifying bad guys. I'm interested in the encyclopedia, and that starts now, not on March 9. -
[GTBacchus]: You know, I can't answer ''why'' somebody feels persecuted. However, I do believe that the feeling is sincere. The idea that recognizing this means that \""we're here to accommodate unfounded paranoia\"" is a bit of a stretch, I think. I'm willing to accept that he might be upset for \""the wrong reasons,\"" but I'm still going to practice de-escalation, y'know? The ideal is that we all work together. <p> I'm not interested in charging him with personal attacks because I might not agree that his feelings of being hounded are sufficiently justified. If he's willing to leave off the personal remarks, then I'm willing to let all of the past go. I'm here for the present, and for the future, not for the past. -
[GTBacchus]: (I'd appreciate if you refrain from making your posts all boldface.) Tell me something specific you want me to do, and maybe I'll do it. Tell me how upset you are that nobody watches the watchmen, and that I won't play cop, and... you won't get what you want. You might get some satisfaction out of complaining, but I was under the impression you're here to edit articles. Meanwhile, criticizing the person who's trying to help you is... fun? I dunno. If I'm so useless, get someone else. If you decide to get over your desire for justice, and that what you want is input on the encyclopedia, then I will ''help'' you, a lot. I am your servant, if you decide that you want to prioritize the encyclopedia over your wounded ego. 'Til then.... good luck. -
[GTBacchus]: Well... I'll deal with it in realtime, not in history. What's your brilliant suggestion? Ban him now? I'm all ears, funny-bunny; what you got? -
[GTBacchus]: You want someone to do '''what'''? You want me to grow powers that I haven't got? You want me to block... whom? What have I selectively enforced? Why take your frustration with the whole community out on me? Am I not trying to help you? Is this how you express gratitude? <p> Figure out what you want, and how to pragmatically get it. If you just want to complain, I don't want to hear it. I'm here to find solutions. Cough one up. Don't say you want \""someone to do something\""; say what you want specifically, and from whom. Then, if it's realistic, we've got something to talk about. Right now... it's pretty clear that expressing your upsetness is more important to you than the article. Get that out of your system, and come back when you wish to be productive. Nobody's stopping you but yourself right now. -
[GTBacchus]: I don't mind. -
[GTBacchus]: Camaron. Is it really so unusual that someone who is upset applies different standards to themselves and to others? Is it really so unusual that someone who believes they are right, and that they have been wronged, goes on to see their own statements as entirely justified, and others' as unfair? Is that really so weird? Does it make the person such a sociopath that we can't work with them? Is your comment so important that you'd rather stand on ceremony than care about the fact that maybe it ''really did'' hurt someone, whether or not that's reasonable? <p> If you believed that you have been acting appropriately, and then someone suggests that you're finally going to start acting appropriately, wouldn't you see that as rude? Is it really so hard to guess what it's like in this guy's shoes? That's all I'm suggesting. -
[GTBacchus]: I know that you're frustrated, and you have every right to feel that way. I will agree that you have been wronged. However, I will not let you dictate to me how to do my job, how Wikipedia works, or how you want to get justice out of an encyclopedia, which is a bit like trying to get blood out of a turnip. -
[GTBacchus]: Oh, if you want to get the attention of a lot of admins at once, post to [[WP:AN\/I]]. Posting there with an expectation of justice often leads to sadness, though. We're all volunteers, you know, and like other humans, we resent being bossed around, especially by someone who's asking for help. -
[GTBacchus]: Sigh... I don't mean to be inconsistent or rude. I'm sorry. It has happened in the past that people ask me for help, and then start telling me how to do my job. In fact, it has happened to me quite recently, so I'm probably letting some of my irritation from that interfere with this issue. I apologize for that. <p> Now... I see what you're asking for. I don't think I have the power to do that. I can't make people apologize, I can't make people take back things they said, I can't even warn them in a way they'll take seriously. I'm just some guy. There are two other admins against me, for crying out loud! What am I supposed to do, grow wings? <p> What I can do, and I'm pretty good at, is help you in a content dispute. If you're bothered by behavior, then I can help you with that, but I can only do it one way. I'm a one-trick pony. I can't play cop; I'm incompetent at that. All I can do is help negotiate a content dispute. It turns out that this is also the ''only effective way'' to deal with the type of behavior you're complaining about. But... I guess you just don't believe me about that. I don't know how to help you. I'm a one-trick pony. If you want that trick done, I'll do it, but I won't play cop, because I can't. There are, like, 1500 other active admins. The only ones who are willing to play cop, are assholes. I avoid them. -
[GTBacchus]: By the way, and I foolishly didn't say this sooner... I don't believe in \""culpability\"". I don't think that you're in the least bit to blame ''for anything''. I don't believe in the reality of \""blame\"". That's why I was not suggesting anything about culpability. I think it's like the tooth-fairy, only pernicious. I can defend this point with all the vigor of a degree in philosophy and a pretty well-examined life, but I don't think that's the conversation you're looking to have. Suffice to say that I hold you to be utterly blameless, forever, in all matters. Everyone else, too. I'm weird.... <p> But! If you just agree to put aside whatever you're hung up on, and let me edit content alongside you, you'll find that I'm a pretty good person to have around. -
[GTBacchus]: Overblown? No doubt. Did I claim anything was \""right\""? No. Would I very much like to see the IP editor and the others editing here together constructively, and am I willing to go out of my way to help make that happen? Yes. Do I believe that conciliatory action is worth it, if it brings people to a table together? Yes. Do I believe that these people can work together, and by doing so make the article and the encyclopedia better? Yes. Are each of us in a position to learn more about working well with others? Yes. <p> I don't know what your goals are. Do I think you're being helpful by standing on ceremony over a remark you don't care much about? No. <p> I'm not trying to be a jerk, here. I'm trying to be helpful. How is it such a trauma that you might go a centimeter out of your way to help someone feel they're being dignified, a little bit? Why insist that another person totally abase themselves, and accept that they're the only party that's been rude, or anything? Why not go out your way to be a peacemaker? Why not help the guy? He's not a bad person, and it doesn't cost us a penny to help. If we just work together, the article and the encyclopedia will be better for all of our collaboration, and more points of view are helpful to have on board. <p> This is depressing. -
[GTBacchus]: Aw, geez. I didn't mean to do [[meatball:GoodBye|that]]. I'm not likely to go anywhere. I kind of love this crazy-ass project, it turns out. I learn a lot here, and usually I feel pretty good about it. <p> I thank you both, for the words of confidence. -
[GTBacchus]: I apologize for making such a scene earlier. I got upset, but then a friend came over, and we studied some mathematics, and then we had some drinks, and I'm feeling better. I usually don't freak out like that; sorry. <p> I think it's pretty clear that people all around the issue feel offended, and that nobody's goal was ever to offend anyone else. When people get defensive, they end up coming across as offensive, and then you get a cycle of hurt feelings and grudges, and it's straight up ''difficult'' to break out of that. The only way I know of is for ''everyone'' to swallow their pride, and I really want for the good of the project to be sufficient reason for people to do this. <p> This is why I've started insisting that if someone wants me to help them, they drop any and all mention of personal issues. A lot of people aren't willing to do this, and I'm still trying to figure out the best way of dealing with that dynamic. Perhaps I should invest a little less, emotionally, in what happens here. It's just that I care. -
[GTBacchus]: Thank you for this, Rich. I hope he or she reads it. -
[GTBacchus]: That's easy. Firstly and most importantly, I work in a context. Dressing someone down for something they did a week or a month ago is useless. Our site policies explicitly note that we never take punitive measures, only preventative ones. Also... give me a chance. What have you got to lose? In context, I'm telling you that I'm pretty good at dealing with people making personal attacks. It involves being there when it happens. You got more questions? <p> Just give me a chance, man. It doesn't cost you a thing, and what's your alternative? I'm offering you so much, and you're being so picky... I'm offering to get down in the trenches with you and work alongside you. You don't like it; walk away, see how far that gets you. Have you even asked any other admins, or why are you still even talking to me? Why? -
[GTBacchus]: Yeah... we eventually do. -
[GTBacchus]: Yeah... so there's an option: live in ideal-world, and assume that things are as you feel they should be... or live in this world, and let pragmatism be a consideration. Easy choice for me. -
[GTBacchus]: You seem to think I'm trying to sweep something away. You have no idea. The missing link is that following the pragmatic approach will \""magically\"" lead you to a place where your principles will find fertile soil, put down deep roots, and thrive. You got two options here. I guess you know that, though. <p> Standing on the principle you're standing on now... good luck. Did you notice the \""new leaf\"" comment was struck? All I had to do was have my worst morning ever on Wikipedia, and it happened. How else can I eviscerate myself to help you? Oh wait - that's not ''your'' principle. Forget me... I don't exist. -
[GTBacchus]: Ha! Point well taken. :) -
[GTBacchus]: I didn't mess up my quantifiers, did I? Let's be formal: \""for every editor X who feels their time was wasted, there exists precisely one editor Y whom they can thank.\"" Yeah, that works. The solution is X=Y! <p> That's unless you've been going door-to-door and forcing people at gunpoint to comment on your not-yet-begun RfA. Really, you should know better than that... some of us haven't got doors! -
[GTBacchus]: The secret, which people find ''extremely'' difficult to believe, is this: the best way to win a personal dispute is to stop trying to win it. That's a beautiful paradox, and it works, and unless you take a leap of faith, you never find that out. -
[GTBacchus]: Yeah, but winning ''by'' fighting fails to work. Gets you banned, eventually. -
[GTBacchus]: Huh. What you say here is clearly well thought-out, and I largely agree. I don't think the editor's \""going anonymous\"" is necessarily a cause of so much stress. There are anonymous contributors who do very well; we've got a regular at [[Wikipedia:Requested moves]] who helps keep the page flowing, and occasionally even does \""adminly\"" actions. When people question those, I defend the guy. I really dig anonymous editing, and I do it myself sometimes. <p> When one wants to get past some kind of dispute... what you've said kicks in with full force. Either having a static IP address (like the RM helper), or else making an account, will get you where you want to go faster. Even if you don't want to do that, doing something such as making an identifiable signature - \""JJ 99.121.41.55,\"" with the number changing, but keeping \""JJ\"" - would do the trick. <p> If the phenomenon of people editing anonymously is going to catch on, which I doubt, then it will happen because a lot of people are doing it successfully, and not because people are generating tons of static while doing it. -
[GTBacchus]: Hey... I'm sorry. I was making what I thought was a funny joke. If you think I called you an idiot, then I obviously screwed up, and I'm sorry. I didn't mean to call you anything. I imagined it was clearly funny. I'm not upset; I'm being playful.  -
[GTBacchus]: I was kind of hoping the self-deprecating irony would be clear, i.e., that I was saying something about courtesy (something which I believe to be true!) in a very rude way. It was really just a badly executed attempt to inject humor into what I was saying. -
[GTBacchus]: I'd take it to AfD and let the community determine notability or not. Don't try to take it on your own shoulders. -
[GTBacchus]: I don't often say it, but \""LOL\"". I've been likened to [[The Big Lebowski|the Dude]] before, but the little green guy is new for me. If I draw any more of these comparisons, I'll have to start a section on my user page documenting them! -
[GTBacchus]: Ched, hi. Thanks for the link. I like the look of that essay. There's one I wrote a little while ago called [[WP:On assuming good faith]] (horribly un-catchy name, I know; the acronym sucks, too). I was on the Wikipedia irc channel when I saved the first version, and I immediately received the feedback, \""Please stop vandalizing Wikipedia with your essay-cruft.\"" I'm pretty confident it was tongue in cheek. ;) I'm definitely a fan of the wiki-essay. My most recent attempts are [[User:GTBacchus\/Dealing with conflict]] and [[Wikipedia:You might be Wikilawyering if...]]. Thanks again for the link, and for fighting the good fight. -
[GTBacchus]: Like I said before, I think, I'm an extender of last chances. If someone burns through my patience, there's a good probability they've also exhausted the community's patience. If someone shows me wrong, I'll be very happy. I never like seeing someone go. <p> If there's an ArbCom case, I'm sure I'll see you there. -
[GTBacchus]: Thank you for saying this. The positive side of failing is that I have a chance to learn something. I hope I can figure out what my lesson is in this case. -
[GTBacchus]: I was staring at this in incomprehension, a streamer of drool gradually descending from my lower lip to the keyboard, eyelids fluttering hypnotically, when I was shocked into awakenness, partly by a coughing fit, and partly by realizing that, hey! I'm a math teacher! I'll bet I can figure this one out. <p> Let's see... X is an editor who feels their time was wasted by your RfA... Y is the person they have to thank... there's a square on the hypotenuse, and the law of cosines says the driver on the z-axis has right-of-way if they're facing into the sun, and I'm in GMT-5, and a kilo is 2.2 pounds.... no. No, I lost it. I've gotta write an algebra test for tomorrow morning. Anybody got a clue about \""3x<sup>2<\/sup> - 5x + 8 = 6\""? -
[GTBacchus]: I hope he does turn up. I gave him a link. I'd like to see what he has to say right now. I encouraged him to post a ''positive'' comment at the RFC, but he wasn't supportive enough to do that... just to allude that he might later. -
[GTBacchus]: If that actually means anything, then please add it. If it's ''just'' a pun, do whatever you like. My original intention of the page is that it makes valid and valuable points in a funny way. If the humor leaves the ground completely, I'll keep my grumbling to a minimum. My intention with the page is actually to improve the encyclopedia by pointing out unhelpful behaviors, but I don't own it. -
[GTBacchus]: Bugs, I recognize that your line above is a reference to the cultural phenomenon that I consciously referenced when writing the page. Good work; super. Rock and roll. Imma go do somethin' else now. -
[GTBacchus]: Ah, you think I have a sense of humor. Baseball Bugs might disagree. At any rate, if this is nirvana, I don't want to know what want to know what [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] is like. -
[GTBacchus]: Your negativity is as unwelcome as you can possibly imagine. Don't talk to me, if you're going to do this. I told my page was a respect zone. Are you going to respect that boundary? Your negativity is not welcome here. -
[GTBacchus]: In my honest esitmation, you bring more harm to the project than Badagnani does, by your unwillingness to eschew the sniping, barbed, hurtful, poisonous remarks. Your sense of humor would be infinitely better if you left out the spite. -
[GTBacchus]: Don't try to get me to laugh by disparaging someone I'm currently putting my emotion on the line to work with. Duh! Would you hang out in a classroom and mock the students, expecting the teacher to appreciate that? That's not the kind of support I need. I'm not trying to be a dick, but... come on! -
[GTBacchus]: You have no idea. You can't see into my soul. I know it's not life or death, but I also know that I'm here to make the world a better place, and that I strongly believe in the idea of \""blessed are the peacemakers\"". I try to be one of those. I try to get opposing parties to respect each other, and I have received positive feedback for doing this in the past. <p> From my perspective, and I welcome correction, you're injecting disrespect into situations where I'm, quite voluntarily and freely, investing some of my real feelings in. My doing this is not a crime, and I know how to control it. That doesn't mean that I appreciate humor that derides someone with whom I'm trying to work. <p> I really ''am'' a teacher; this is how I make a living. If you start making fun of one of my students, I'm not going to appreciate it, and if I did, I'd be a shitty teacher. That's sure as hell extra-true if you do it somewhere they can hear or read it later. <p> I'm a grown up, and I can decide just how much I want to invest where. I can decide when I want to take on a student who requests it, and when I want to try and convince someone of something, whether or not they're willing. I appreciate your respecting me enough to let me set my own boundaries. When I told you this page was a respect zone, I thought it was clear what that meant. <p> I like funny stuff. I like really out-there, off-color, bizarre humor. I just don't use it to make fun of people I'm trying - of my own free will - to help. Is that unreasonable? -
[GTBacchus]: I was born in 1976. I don't buy that it's a generational thing. When I'm in the context of dealing (out of my own free will!) with someone who has fragile emotions and needs delicate handling, I'm not going to appreciate remarks disparaging them, that they can see. I don't think you're too old or too young to recognize that one can be funny without insulting or disparaging anyone. The best comedians I know of, from any generation, manage to do it. -
[GTBacchus]: I like the Marx Brothers movies, for example, but I wouldn't want them in the room where I'm trying to mediate a dispute between upset parties. I don't think that makes me a prudish bore, nor an overly politically-correct tight-ass. -
[GTBacchus]: Does that mean you can respect where I'm coming from? I'm not sure I know what \""bringing them out\"" means, but is it something that's done via humorous insults? I tend to deal with people who are not prepared for that, and with whom that is a bad idea. Do you generally consider who your audience is, or not? -
[GTBacchus]: I find the idea that my sense of humor is \""kinder and gentler\"" rather absurd. Some of my favorite jokes are among the most offensive I can imagine. I like [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] for example, and consider [[Uncyclopedia]] to be written by and for gerbils. My favorite YouTube is the George Washington rap, and I wrote and recorded the song, \""I Love You; I'll Still Fuck Your Sister\"". I just don't bring this stuff up while trying to mediate a dispute between parties who almost certainly come from different cultures, as well as different generations. -
[GTBacchus]: Well, in that case, I hope you didn't take any offense. :) -
[GTBacchus]: Good. Do you understand why I'm a bit prickly if you drop off \""humor\"" that would likely people with whom I'm trying to do delicate mediation work? Diplomats do not generally make fun of the upset parties between whom they're trying to broker peace. That's been true since a long time before you were born, right? <p> There is a time and a place for \""rough hewn\"" humor, and there's a time and a place for handling matters delicately. I hope you'll trust me to distinguish between those two cases, and to try and respect that distinction on my talk page. I'm not asking for much. <p> If you want to make me laugh, just do it in ''any way'' that doesn't look like disrespect for people I'm trying to help. There are millions of funny things to say that don't disparage anyone here. I don't think this is a weird or unfair request. Am I being reasonable? -
[GTBacchus]: Come on. Do you imagine for a second that this isn't constantly in my mind? How about a little more credit, Bugs? Maybe, just maybe, I have a clue what I'm doing? If Badagnani were not contributing a lot of good content, I wouldn't be trying to help him. However, if you think I'm \""nursemaiding\"" difficult users, then you fail to understand what I'm doing. Thanks for the vote of confidence. <p> Why are you talking to me? Seriously. Are you trying to help me? Why? Are you nursemaiding this difficult user called GT? Why? Do you want to convince me that Badagnani isn't worth helping? I'll keep my own counsel about when that's true. Do you not trust me to set my own boundaries and maintain them? Why? -
[GTBacchus]: Well, I do consider what's said. I'm not sure that you realize that I've thought this stuff out pretty well. If I seem to reject your suggestions, it's because I've considered them, and I've considered my own beliefs about the world and about other people. I trust my beliefs more than I trust that you are fit to advise on the topic of dispute resolution. I've never seen you resolve a dispute. Maybe you're quite the diplomat; I don't know. I haven't seen it. <p> What do you want to bring about? How do you want me to change, and why should I change based on your wants? Shall I accept you as an authority on how I should behave? Why? <p> So far, all the suggestions I've seen you make have amounted to, \""don't bother to try and make this situation better, GT. Don't bother to try and help Badagnani, GT. Don't bother to follow your own conscience and ideals, GT. Don't bother to try and learn as much as you can about how disputes work, and how we can find ways out of them. Don't bother. Be more cynical and pessimistic.\"" <p> Maybe I should be reading something different from your suggestions, but that's how they've been coming across to me. If that's not what you're saying, then maybe you haven't been entirely clear. If that is what you're saying, then I say get thee behind me. I believe in things. You can't change that. -
[GTBacchus]: I'll have a look at this when I'm back online later tonight. -
[GTBacchus]: So you still think I'm \""nursemaiding\"". That's too bad. If you've got a problem with specific people of specific articles, then I can help. I can't answer your question in the abstract, because that would imply that so many situations are clear cases of black and white, good editors versus difficult editors... I don't buy it. Things are more complicated than that. <p> So you ask me what you're supposed to think? You ask me what you can do? I've got an answer. Take the moral high ground, do it right, let others help you, and let's get there. I am available to help with any situation that comes up; otherwise, I'm a goddamned hypocrite to give anyone advice about anything. You think there's an easy answer? There isn't. If you want to help fix the problem, don't be a part of the problem. Don't be someone who is willing to simplistically judge other editors as \""difficult\"". Join me in the struggle to get everyone on board. Don't tell me that my ideals are worthless, or I will hate you forever, and dedicate my life to proving you wrong. <p> Now, if you say that anyone claims that the important thing is to \""coddle these people,\"" I don't believe you. Point out anyone who has said that, ever. If you can't, then stop lying. I sure as fuck never say it. Stop portraying my position as some kind of spineless, mindless mollycoddling. Nobody advocates that. You want to help? Let me help you. Don't give me your fucking jaded, cynical, \""these people\"" vomit. There are no \""these people\"". We're one species, trying to survive. If you want anything from me, lead me to situations where I can help in an actual context. Don't try to pump overgeneralized shit about \""nursemaiding\"" into my ears. Step up, with some courage and some honesty, and let's get to work on these problems. I'm standing here with a goddamned shovel, saying \""Let me help you in the trenches,\"" and your reply is to come back with lazy-assed cliche bullshit platitudes about who's worth working with and who isn't? Grow a fucking pair, and show me where the problem is, and let's work on it. If you're not willing to fight to the motherfucking death to be part of the solution, then I never want to hear anything from you again. Is that clear enough? -
[GTBacchus]: So you're still talking because...? Yeah. That's what I thought. See ya! -
[GTBacchus]: Oh, whatever you claim to have told me, was lost among your attempts at humor. If you want to communicate clearly, practice. -
[GTBacchus]: I've been offline for a week or so. There was a death in the family, and concerns other than Wikipedia have been pressing. I'll look at this situation, and tell you what I think, TruthIIPower. Schrandit, hi. -
[GTBacchus]: I would prefer not to see you here, Baseball Bugs. This page is not mine, I know, but your input so far has been so negative and unwelcome that I want to leave Wikipedia when I see you post here. If your goal is to make me feel worse about this project, then by all means, keep helping out here on my talk page. -
[GTBacchus]: I do not believe that \""everyone can be saved\"". You are wrong about my beliefs. You're wrong about my priorities. I don't care that you're wrong, but you're wrong. My top priority is the encyclopedia and its content. -
[GTBacchus]: What I mostly want is for you to leave me alone, Baseball Bugs. I disagree with your ''methods'' of defending content. The negativity of your methods will hurt content more than it help it, in the long run, in my opinion. We disagree. I will keep my own counsel as to whether your methods are negative enough for me to call them that. Now please, leave me alone. Please take me off your watchlist. I won't bother you, either. Thank you. -
[GTBacchus]: I'm really not interested in lecturing you. I'm happy just to note that we disagree, and to see you go. I'm happy to know that you feel good about your input, and see me as hypocritical\/wrong\/whatever. I wish you the best; goodbye. -
[GTBacchus]: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see that. I'll put it back. -
[GTBacchus]: Why... thank you! I'm glad to know I am making sense, to someone other than myself. -
[GTBacchus]: I've never had a sincere apology taken as trolling before. I don't know what to say. I clearly screwed up badly, and I've already disengaged. I was taught to apologize when I know I was wrong, and I'm going to continue to live that way. -
[GTBacchus]: No, no... I'm quite the sinner. Thanks, though. :) <p> I might as well have known that there was no point talking to him. I did genuinely believe he might hear something from me, but I never know how to pitch my tone with someone whose own approach is so abrasive. Sometimes, they respond well to bluntness. Sometimes, that ''really'' doesn't work. <p> By the time of my last post, which provoked this, I was genuinely trying to apologize and go away without the disruption of leaving a message he would have to delete. It backfired, but whatever. This isn't the kind of situation that finds my skin thin. When someone really freaks out on me, I stay pretty calm. <p> Aren't we a funny species? <p> If I learn from this, that'll be good work. Here's hoping. <p> The important issue has nothing to do with me or ThuranX. I'd like to know whether Wikipedia is going to develop some smartness about what trolling really is, and how to deal with it. Right now, we've got everyone, each working from his or her own personal theory, and I don't think we can ''all'' be right. -
[GTBacchus]: Yeah, the page [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment\/ThuranX]] doesn't exist yet, but it's already on my watchlist, waiting for the day it does. He does a lot of work defending oft-trolled articles such as [[Barack Obama]], but I suspect that his style of \""defense\"" might be multiplying the problem that it should be solving. That seems to be a page where feeding trolls has been enshrined as an institution. Damn shame, if you ask me. -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks. It took us a few years to get the idea down to that few words. It's certainly been a fun idea to help incubate and develop. Wikipedia is a remarkable kind of system. Like they say, it doesn't work in theory, only in practice. :) -
[GTBacchus]: Feel free to let me know if I can help you use the site in any way. -
[GTBacchus]: Replied there; thanks for the heads-up. -
[GTBacchus]: Shall I post it here? Do you mind if I ask why you're interested? I've got 55 plants, 2 fungi, and 42 animals so far... -
[GTBacchus]: I replied at your page. Come to think of it, I might as well just post it as a subpage here. Let's see.... <s>[[User:GTBacchus\/Home species list]]<\/s>[[User:GTBacchus\/Species list]]. It actually has encyclopedic merit, because I can provide photos of a lot of these critters. -
[GTBacchus]: Actually, translating it from Notepad++ into wiki-markup seems to be non-trivial. I might try to figure this out later. -
[GTBacchus]: Most of these species have nothing to do with food - they're mostly from the lawn and garden, plus my houseplants, and my friends. However, I ''have'' learned about a good half dozen garden \""weeds\"" that make for good eating. -
[GTBacchus]: ''note - I've also pasted a copy of this to [[User:GTBacchus\/Species list]], where I'll keep it up to date and start linking it up and otherwise wikifying it. Could be a useful resource, at the very least because I can take pictures.'' -
[GTBacchus]: Yeah, [[User:GTBacchus\/Species list]] is much more useful. I'll keep that one up-to-date, too! -
[GTBacchus]: Really? -
[GTBacchus]: Does reverting his moves provoke any conflict; does he fight or argue over it? -
[GTBacchus]: I haven't turned on the AC yet, but it's bound to happen before it gets much warmer. Texas summers will cook ya. I wonder if I've heard them and assumed it was crickets? -
[GTBacchus]: Disparaging any other editor is not a good way to get what you want from me. You're sounding more and more like Badagnani. I'll see if I can figure out how ANI archiving works. Now it's a subpage, and I don't know if that changes anything. -
[GTBacchus]: I've replied to your email. If you have issues with Viriditas, I recommend following [[WP:DR]]. If you tell me that someone does not \""deserve\"" your respect, I will respectfully disagree. Rationing out respect to those who you think \""deserve\"" it... is precisely the attitude that causes wars to still be fought among men. Treat others as you would like to be treated, take the moral high ground, rise above the conflict. These old lessons are still quite valuable. <p> If someone disrespects you, and you disrespect them back, then you're both the same. If someone disrespects you, and you respect them anyway, then you win. If you can point me to specific situations where you are being attacked, then maybe I can do something, but after-the-fact, I cannot. -
[GTBacchus]: I don't think Viriditas has taken his\/her own advice about how to catch flies, nor has Viriditas been entirely consistent in approaching the situation. As for \""seeing what one wants to see,\"" I think we're all guilty of that on occasion. <p> That said, I would tend to agree that Viriditas is not helping Badagnani. I'm not sure anyone can help Badagnani, until Badagnani decides to accept help. If you are able to avoid Viriditas, then that sounds like a good idea. -
[GTBacchus]: Everyone's input is useful, insofar as I get to see a broader cross-section. I'm not familiar with this particular Danish Prince. (Perhaps he prefers pastry to pizza?) I'm unlikely to incorporate his advice verbatim into an essay, but I know that some people do think that way, and I would like to somehow address those people. <p> The trick is that the people who need the advice most are precisely those who are least likely to listen. A good essay might be able to gain enough consensus for people to call it a guideline, though. As much as I like to disdain such reindeer games, tinkering with the \""status\"" of a page, sometimes common sense needs all the leverage it can get. -
[GTBacchus]: And I think I'm just now figuring out... yeah. I'm sticking by my guns. Hamlet gets the same answer anyone would. -
[GTBacchus]: I was just about to that understanding. Hamlet will certainly be welcome to pitch in whenever I try and write down some of these thoughts in some format for general consumption. I think his comments are already helping temper my Quixoticity to an extent. That's always helpful. -
[GTBacchus]: I think it's wild that I come across as someone who has to be told that sometimes humor is helpful for maintaining perspective. I must be a terrible communicator. Maybe I just have the wrong sense of humor for this project. I'd do alright at ED, but I'm more interested in building an encyclopedia than I am in documenting the foibles of Internet culture. Now ''those guys'' know how to handle a troll. -
[GTBacchus]: I like that it sounds like a form of autism. \""Slow? Nah, he's got the Quick's Autism.\"" Of course, \""quixoticity\"" sounds like a form of \""toxicity\"". -
[GTBacchus]: I'm pretty confident they use it recreationally. -
[GTBacchus]: That would explain a lot, I'm sure. :) I wonder if the English apply it to their upper lips. -
[GTBacchus]: You know what that was? It was a mistake. For some reason, I missed the datestamps. Nevertheless, I don't really think you can say I was disrupting the talk page if you chose to reply to me there. As for your \""Badagnani solution\"", he offers the same for dealing with you. I can't tell that either of you is much better than the other, as far as handling disputes here. You find an admin willing to block him, and that'll be great. I'm involved, so I can't. I won't overturn it. Until you can get someone to do that, he's all of our problem. <p> If you want to tell me how to do my job, become an administrator, or at least successfully resolve some dispute. Meanwhile, if I see you interacting with Badagnani in an escalatory way, I have little choice but to say something. I hope you understand. <p> I will, in the future, be more careful about replying to threads that haven't fallen quiet for weeks. -
[GTBacchus]: \""''Wouldn't it be better to discuss your concerns on my talk page instead?  That way you are not escalating the problem.''\"" - Um... have I not already done this? What else can I do? Here we are! What do you want from me: public apologies and breast-beating? <p> When I say \""he offers the same for dealing with you,\"" I mean that Badagnani offers the solution of blocking you, while you suggest blocking him. Unless one of you seems more interested in dispute resolution, I can't prefer one over the other. <p> \""''Besides, we know that Badagnani's problems have nothing to with me.''\"" No. We don't know that. \""Know\"" is a very strong word. I believe that those who suggest that Badagnani is being harassed and hounded have a ''very good point''. I see nobody in this conflict who has consistently worked towards resolution rather than escalation. When I've suggested that you be more resolution-oriented, you've blown me off. I will cheerfully provide diffs if you don't remember. You're either pursuing active diplomacy, or you don't care about resolving disputes. Wikipedia is all about resolving disputes and not prolonging them. How have you helped to resolve this one? -
[GTBacchus]: I have no idea. Honestly, the idea of funny, cartoon-character trolls isn't much help - to me anyway. I think the important message is that we all need to respect each other 100%, and that people who treat situations here adversarially need to change or else leave. I don't know how sock puppets can help convey that. I'm sorry if this makes me a jerk. -
[GTBacchus]: By the way, \""''Please stop disrupting this article's talk page. Thanks!''\"" is a great thing to say to me if what you wish to communicate is, \""I have zero respect for you, GTB\"". If that's not your message, then talk to me differently. If your goal is to destroy any possibility of working with me, keep up with that tone. Seriously, how were you not born knowing this? -
[GTBacchus]: I need some time away from all of this. I think I've been lashing out randomly, so I'm going to walk away for a while. Keep the faith. -
[GTBacchus]: (Edit conflict - nice timing :)) Is there any reason to delete the history, or should it be kept under the redirect? We usually don't delete after merges because there's a question of attribution, as some of the merged content has its history at [[Maharishi Vedic Science]]. Does that make sense? -
[GTBacchus]: Meh. I've been almost fully inactive for the last week, playing computer games into the wee hours, because I'm suddenly on vacation. Next week I'll rejoin the human race. About 90% of what I've done on wiki in the past week should probably have never been done. As the poet said, \""everyone goes south, every now and then.\"" -
[GTBacchus]: I might be interested. Anything I write will reflect my point of view, of course. Some people think that I feed trolls, and I think that they feed trolls. It's kind of fun. -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks. -
[GTBacchus]: Thank you; I have commented there. -
[GTBacchus]: Do you that's true in this particular case, or just in general? I was carrying out the users request, more than trying to do what it says on a page somewhere, but if people think I'm wrong, I'll undo it. -
[GTBacchus]: Oh, yeah... it turns out I care. Thanks for taking the time. -
[GTBacchus]: The trouble is, when I argue to do something, people think that I am arguing we should do it because someone \""deserves\"" it. That's never what I mean, just as nobody ever means that someone really jjjjhed anything. -
[GTBacchus]: There's a big difference between this and spammers. Letting spammers leave their spam here degrades the quality of the encyclopedia. Deleting his talk page would not. <p> Actually, I keep reading, and I see that you're making an argument that... let's see: Capitulating to this request would embolden future banned users to make similar demands. I guess my reply to that is... that I see no disadvantage in deleting those pages, so... I'm okay with that. <p> The \""he was a jerk anyway\"" attitude... I understand, but I try to avoid it in my own mind. That's not a judgment; I don't expect anyone to share my views. <p> I think that, if someone comes back with the same bee in their bonnet, then we'll know it, talk page or no talk page. I mean, we've still got the \""contributions\"" button, which leads to a lot more information than their talk page, y'know? If they come back without the bee, then they're welcome. Meanwhile, the only benefit to keeping the talk page around is that it encourages busy-body behavior, and amateur Wiki-sleuthing, and I don't see that stuff as positive at all. Does that make sense? -
[GTBacchus]: Oh, no... It'll take more than this to scare off old GT. I might recede into the woodwork for a while, and do a bunch of wiki-gnoming or something, but I'll be around... Thanks. -
[GTBacchus]: It appears someone has already noted that. Thanks for the heads-up, and no worries about the page. I just hope it's over now. -
[GTBacchus]: Yeah. I think I'm all out of things to say. Thanks for taking the time to explain your point of view. -
[GTBacchus]: I guess I do have two more things to say. First, I don't think DT was a \""dramatic\"". I think he was taking a good-faith stance about our standards for admins. I think that determining him to be a \""dramatic\"" is just as wrong as it is always - dead wrong - to call someone a troll. There is no support for that kind of behavior from an organization that wishes to run according to anything resembling professional standards. We respond to behavior, not to perceived intent. What we need is not to keep \""dramatics\"" away, but to learn how to deal with them correctly. This is another brick in the dealing-with-them-incorrectly wall. We made that drama - he didn't. <p> Second, in order for the \""detection\"" argument to make sense, we would have to believe the possibility of a world where he sneaks back, only remains undetected because non-admins can't see his talk history, and then somehow does harm while remaining undetected. I think that world is somewhere the other side of Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy. -
[GTBacchus]: If disruptive editors are Wikipedia's biggest problem, it's because we childishly refuse to get good at dealing with them. This is my greatest disappointment here. We've institutionalized childishness when it comes to handling disruption, and we coddle editors who typify the worst of this kind of behavior. -
[GTBacchus]: I don't see those dramatics as his. He tried to just leave his talk page as a statement attached to an unblock request, and we wouldn't let him. He asked if he could invoke RTV, which I see as anti-dramatic, and when we wouldn't let him, at least not as far as the talk page. I see that he tried to walk away, and that... some unnamed Wikipedians edit-warred over his page, and ''brought our own dramatics'' to the table. He didn't make anyone fight over that page. Leaving a goodbye note that doesn't name names, but pretty much indicates dissatisfaction, does not count as \""dramatics\"" in my book. It counts as trying to leave with some scrap of dignity. We didn't let him, because we preferred sending him off with contempt. We're not very big, it turns out. <p> This is the general problem of dealing with \""trolling\"" behavior. Identifying is ''not'' the first step to solving that problem. That's because as soon as we identify it as trolling - a troll earns his wings somewhere. The correct way to deal with trolling is to respond in a drama-negative way that will be perfectly acceptable whether or not they're trolling. Trying to identify them and act accordingly ''gives them power''. We do ''not'' have to empower trolls, but this community has a very bad habit of doing precisely that. I'm disappointed at how few people seem to care, and how willing the community is to allow our worst troll-handlers and troll-feeders to maintain control over the most controversial articles. <p> We have '''got''' to stop institutionalizing troll-feeding, and this episode has been a great example of how we consistently do it wrong. The correct approach is to let him leave his goodbye note in whatever format he prefers (within reason), and then to slap the living shit out of anyone who tries to meddle with it after that. Those busybodies cause the dramatics, not DT. Those are the people that we coddle, rather than running out of town, like we should. Critics are excellent to have around, and we just lost one. Meanwhile, we prop up those who prefer not to hear criticism, thus weakening our community. It's disgusting. -
[GTBacchus]: Yeah, I don't necessarily mean to deny the reality of moral valuations. I just deny that I'm in any position to make them, so I try to define them out of the picture, and then make decisions on practical grounds, proceeding from one or two moral axioms. In particular, I tend to ''define'' each human life as an infinitely valuable expression of the divine, and I define Good Action as that motivated by love of the whole (God) and the parts (one's neighbors). I deny \""free will\"" except as a subjective feeling of uncertainty (thus jettisoning moral credit and blame), and identify the Good with the Actual. <p> These are, of course, mutually self-contradictory religious claims that are not subject to testing or proof. Thus, I don't expect anyone in particular to agree with me, and I'm pretty happy when someone does. Also, because they're non-trivial religious claims, I constantly fall short of really living according to them. But, you know, that's why there's always a tomorrow. -
[GTBacchus]: Hi, Olive. You're not intruding, and I'm happy to hear from you. That was a difficult situation, where I kept trying to account for my words, because I thought I was being asked to account for them. It didn't seem to work out. I'll probably be quiet for a while, and maybe I'll come back cleverer about these things. Thanks for your thoughts. -
[GTBacchus]: Hi. I'm not entirely sure what you're saying. I mean, all those sentences make sense, but if you're describing what happened... I'm not following. <p> I had an extremely unpleasant set of interactions with someone, in which a lot of apologies were demanded of me, and I found myself simultaneously attacked in various ways. An apology was demanded of me that seemed to involve \""admitting\"" to have said something I never said. If that's the kind of apology that someone demands, then I think it's very fair to point out that the conditions demanded are at odds with reality - if someone says, \""apologize for purposely insulting me\"", when I didn't purposely insult the person... then where does this act of pure grace come in. <p> Finally, I have no idea what this means: \""''Perhaps the ambiguity can be resolved by considering and performing one act as an \""apology,\"" the other as a \""promise\"" (which you evidently intended and made here).''\"". What? What promise? <p> Can you be more specific and concrete, because I have no idea whether you're criticizing me (which would be fine), or what. I'm sorry (whatever that means), but I do not follow what you're saying, and how it applies to the situation I assume you're talking about. <p> If you're offering advice, can you make it clear? I'd love to learn from this situation, but this seems very cryptic. -
[GTBacchus]: That's interesting. I'm not sure I know ''exactly'' what you mean, but I know that this is a topic the community has not really ever talked about, at least not in a way that led to any kind of consensus. I wonder, what do you think would be a smart strategy? Is it a question of identifying and stopping trolls, or is it a question of finding a way to respond to all callers that will not reward trolling? I find that we reward them quite a lot, which seems wrong. I'm pretty sure that calling them \""troll\"" counts as rewarding them, for example. -
[GTBacchus]: Thank you. I think you've managed to say what nobody else has, to make me feel somehow understood. Thanks very much for that. I've already stopped caring about whatshisname, but I was still bummed out by the lack of human feeling from anyone here. You've just made me feel a lot better about that, and I thank you very much. -
[GTBacchus]: What, what? I mean, what? -
[GTBacchus]: Hi. I was just looking into the speedy deletion of [[:File:2001 Results VA.JPG]] when I noticed that it was actually different from the file it was supposed to be a duplicate of, [[:File:Virginia 2001 Election Results.JPG]]. At least three counties changed colors between the two images. I posted a message to [[User talk:Hekerui]], who tagged it for speedy deletion, but by the time I had composed that message the image was gone. I'm just giving you a heads-up; perhaps the second image is more accurate. If it turns out to have been an error, I'm sure we can just get the correct file re-uploaded. Anyway, have a good day! -
[GTBacchus]: Cool, thanks. -
[GTBacchus]: Yes, it seems that we are in agreement on this point. -
[GTBacchus]: Looking at [[K. B. Reid]], I see that it's an article I deleted due to notability concerns. Would you like for me to copy the contents of the article to a page where you can use them to prepare another article? If so, sure, I can do that. Just let me know, but do please familiarize yourself with our guideline [[WP:BIO]], and be sure that the requirements there are met by the subject. -
[GTBacchus]: Replied at your talk page. In short: I've restored the article and moved it to: [[User:Donotask-donottell\/K. B. Reid]]. -
[GTBacchus]: Hey, you may be right. Maybe he's got problems. However, we've got to make sure that content disputes don't turn into personal disputes. I mean, if his behavior is really out of line, there is recourse. If you can handle it as a content dispute, however, that's better. Be assured that I've got my eye on the page now, and other admins probably do too. Just keep your eye on the prize, and if you need any help dealing with the other editor, let me know. -
[GTBacchus]: I see that some sourcing issues have been brought up on the talk page. If those can be addressed, and the sources determined to be reliable, then there shouldn't be any problem re-adding the information. -
[GTBacchus]: Well, it seems to be someone, for sure. I agree that these edits are not someone's first exposure to Wikipedia. Beyond that, it's hard to say much. In a way, it doesn't matter, because the answer to the sourcing question doesn't depend on figuring out who this IP is. -
[GTBacchus]: It could. I'd be inclined to ask around, which we can do anytime, of course. I do most of my work in areas other than evaluating sources, so I'm not necessarily up to date on best practices. <p> What's the refactoring issue, exactly? -
[GTBacchus]: Oh, I see. I thought you meant he was like, editing your comments in a discussion or something. I get it. I don't really know anything about those {{tl|dyk}} templates. They usually live on the talk pages of articles that have been featured in \""Did you know?\"", right? <p> As for discussion, I'm pretty sure we're having it now, and I've also posted to the talk page there. -
[GTBacchus]: I'm going to have to get back to you tomorrow. I'll have a good look at this situation then. -
[GTBacchus]: Sorry, I've been offline, and now typing is difficult with this splint on my finger... <p> IP users certainly can see their talk page, but it can be tricky to find it. If someone else leaves them a message, then they get the same orange banner we get, but once that's gone, they haven't got the \""my talk\"" link. What I do, when I'm editing anonymously and want to see my talk, is go to some article I've edited, look at the history, and find myself that way. <p> Does that answer your question? -
[GTBacchus]: I'm only online for a minute right now, and this post is confusing me. That thing about BRD being invalid... huh? No, I don't think that. I don't oppose any of our usual policies, so if something I said seems to indicate that, then I must have been unclear. When I have more time later, I'll be back and try to figure out what happened. -
[GTBacchus]: I'm definitely not taking a side, for one thing. You'll find that I am perfectly capable of criticizing those with whom I agree, defending those with whom I disagree, and arguing against reverting even when I agree with the edit. I am '''absolutely not''' taking a side, except for the side of what I consider to be best editing practices. I will be perfectly happy to explain myself at length later this evening. If you want to make edits that stick, sometimes leaving the article in your non-preferred version is a ''smarter'' strategy, that will get you where you want to be ''faster'' than reverting will. -
[GTBacchus]: You can't \""break\"" BRD. It's not a law. We haven't got laws here. What do you want most? -
[GTBacchus]: I understand what you mean. I sometimes am more quick to criticize a party who seems to be in the right if I think that they could be more effective. It's easier to get you on board, it seems to me, than to get Idot on board. I see that I criticized you without making what I was trying to say at all clear, and I apologize for that. <p> Whatever BRD allows, reverting is not always the smartest strategy. Sometimes you're much better off working from the other position, and letting a bad edit stand for a while is a very powerful technique, albeit a very non-intuitive one. I'm pretty sure that the most successful editors follow a zero-revert rule. I try to. <p> Regarding BRD, there's the letter of it, and there's the spirit. The spirit is infinitely more important than the letter, and this is true to the point that I would discourage editors from reading the letter at all once they get the spirit. The spirit of BRD is: \""once there's been a single reversion, everyone stop editing and talk.\"" That [[WP:STATUSQUO]] seems to me to give bad advice, that contradicts the spirit of other policies, and it should probably be rewritten. Insisting that a certain version of the article be visible while discussion is happening is a terrible idea, an invitation to gaming, and not how we should do it. If BRD turns into BRRRRR...., then the point isn't to ensure that the number of Rs is an odd number. The point is to stop adding Rs. -
[GTBacchus]: Which raises the question - given that a revert is allowed, when is it actually a good idea? Not always, it turns out. -
[GTBacchus]: \""''Not reverting bad edits with the hope that the editors will just give up and change their minds when it's clear they don't have consensus''\"", is absolutely ''not'' what I'm talking about. Read my comments again, keeping in mind that I didn't actually say anything that dumb. I'm talking about getting a few ducks in a row, and getting someone else to revert for you, because it's stronger from 2 editors than from 1. The strategy I'm suggesting is significantly ''more'' practical than reverting, based on ''real world results''. Do what works, not just what you figure might work. -
[GTBacchus]: It must be that. The doctor is convinced it's a sports injury, despite my protests that I haven't done any kind of \""sports\"" in the last ''n'' months, where ''n'' is some large number. I can't accept that it's a typing injury, and the doctor says no, it couldn't have been cracking my knuckles that did it. I don't know whether to trust my own account of events, or the guy who's been to medical school. <p> Thank you both for your kind condolences. -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks for the heads up. I'll have a look at that. -
[GTBacchus]: Yeah, there is the occasional [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Jogaila&diff=prev&oldid=174942125 unmistakable case], but those are certainly the exception. <p> I'm a fan of the phrase \""apparent vandalism\"" when blocking blatantly counter-productive users, although my logs indicate that I slip up in practice. (Note to self - slip up less.) I'd be happy enough if the list of common block reasons used that phrase, instead of simply calling it \""vandalism\"" in the automated block summary. Maybe I'll post a note to some appropriate page about that later... -
[GTBacchus]: I poked my head in, a bit. Thanks for the heads-up. I'm getting better at 9-fingered typing, and, thanks partly to our conversation the other day, I've actually made edits to a couple of mathematics articles \u2014 not only [[fractional coloring]], but [[residue (complex analysis)]] as well! The coloring article really needs more pretty pictures, which I'm mulling over on some back-burner. -
[GTBacchus]: Math's a big place you know. Someone working on Hopf Algebras might not know a fractional coloring if it walked up and said \""howdy\"". That Butcher article is over my head, despite my recognizing most of the nouns in the lead section. <p> I've seen [[User:Mathsci]] around, and he seems a little more willing to draw and state conclusions about other editors' motivations than I would be comfortable doing. I'm pretty sure he helps out with some particularly troublesome articles, and has the worn-down patience and the community support that tends to accompany those in such positions. You can't really blame the guy, when our community systematically enables such behavior. Maybe the civility poll currently under way will lead to some kind of change. -
[GTBacchus]: Cobbler? (Cobble 'er? I can't even teach 'er geometry!) -
[GTBacchus]: I've responded there, and completed the page move. Cheers. -
[GTBacchus]: Cheers. :) -
[GTBacchus]: Huh... How are you doing, CoM? I hope the weather is pleasant where you are. It's very hot here. -
[GTBacchus]: I think you just caught me right after waking up. While my math skills kick in within 1 or 2 minutes after I arise, my improv comedy skills follow by like, a whole quarter hour. I'm gettin' old! At 23, I could open my eyes and already be in character... -
[GTBacchus]: When it comes to math, it's very difficult to fake expertise. I would trust interactions ''more'' than a resume, if I want to know whether someone is truly a competent mathematician. I think the community is beginning to open its eyes to what you say - that being an expert does not excuse incivility - extreme or otherwise. We just have to be careful not to swing too far in the ''other'' direction as a reaction. <p> Thanks for your comments. -
[GTBacchus]: We're working on that. It takes a cultural change, and those are difficult. Suggestions are always welcome. -
[GTBacchus]: I've stopped - this was made clear in my last post. That post was just to say that I recognize and respect your expertise. This is true. I have made no comment about the mathematics involved in this case. My \""statements about mathematical edits\"" are '''non-existent'''. It is very clear to me that A. K. Nole didn't know what he was talking about, and that your contributions are extremely valuable. I didn't realize I had to say that. I shall endeavor to remember to make such statements in the future, as I can not assume that people will know what I don't say. <p> I was actually addressing an independent point, unrelated to mathematics. How our experts handle ignorant people ''matters''. I suggest that your handling of the ignorant is sub-optimal. Why you take that as a comment about the mathematics involved in this case is a mystery to me. <p> I hope that you'll re-read my comments with this in mind, that I have no criticism of your mathematical expertise, nor do I fail to value your generosity in sharing it with us. I simply take issue with your handling of the human side of the situation. -
[GTBacchus]: Yeah, I've just reviewed all my contributions to that thread, and not once did I mention anything about your mathematical edits, or about anyone else's. Not once. I'd very much like to know what you mean by, \""[my] statements about mathematical edits\"". -
[GTBacchus]: Hey guys, take it somewhere else. I'm trying to do stuff here, and orange banners that don't concern me are annoying. Stop blowing kisses at each other, or take it elsewhere. Please. -
[GTBacchus]: Please leave me alone. Is it somehow difficult for you to see that I'm not in the mood for this shit? Go away already. -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks. You too. -
[GTBacchus]: This is a strange misinterpretation of my words. I do not think there is anything wrong with you being an expert and spotting those errors. I don't think there is anything wrong with you working to get A.K.Nole away from that article. I think the ''way you did it'' was foolish. I want you to do precisely what you did, minus the foolishness. Approach human interactions as intelligently as you approach mathematics. -
[GTBacchus]: I have zero complaints with your namespace edits, and nowhere in the thread have I taken issue with them at all. I have said that you were uncivil to A.K.Nole, and that is true. My last post in this thread was clarifying to A.K.Nole that I think he '''does not have grounds to pursue action against you'''. That is the point I was making, which led you to think I was attacking your mathematical contributions. <p> If this is how you treat people who try to defend you from frivolous harassment, then I'd hate to see how you treat people who actually wrong you. -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks for that. I'm actually pretty happy with the color. I just don't like for people to have conversations on my talk page that don't concern me, because I have to keep checking back to find out, no, there's no message for me. I find that annoying. -
[GTBacchus]: Oh, I don't mean to cast blame anywhere. We're all just humans, try our best to muddle through. Maybe a color change ''would'' help my nerves. I might try a light blue, or a nice earthy brown. You use green, you say? Plants are green, and we like them... -
[GTBacchus]: Interesting. Then I could just stare at the top of the page and pour bourbon drinks until it changes to a nice color, and only click through then. That sounds difficult to code up... -
[GTBacchus]: I don't disagree that AKNole's posts were very clueless. I don't disagree that he was pratting around. I haven't disagreed with that at all, and I haven't defended any of his edits. I don't defend CoM calling you a jerk. I think that's uncivil and wrong. I don't defend AKNole following you around. I haven't said anything in support of that. <p> I have noticed that I sometimes come across wrong if I fail to criticize each aspect of a situation. I don't necessarily feel I have to criticize AKNole to you. He's ''obviously'' in the wrong regarding his article edits, and I thought that went without saying. <p> If I seem to criticize you more than AKNole, it's because you're more important to the project. He's gone, I'm pretty sure, and scores of editors like him will come and go. Experts are different. You're very valuable because of your knowledge, and we want to keep you. <p> That's why it's so important that you pursue dispute resolution in a way that will minimize stress for you. Earlier in the same thread, I suggested that in similar cases, you appeal to WikiProject Mathematics for backup before the temperature gets too high. Is that really such a bad suggestion? -
[GTBacchus]: That's me, yeah. I'm GTBacchus at WP, at ED, and elsewhere. (Posts on that page should make it obvious beyond the need to ask.) Who wants to know about it? -
[GTBacchus]: The atmosphere is very different; that's right. I'd also say the site has merit, but not that you'd want to hear about it. You seem a bit conservative to me. -
[GTBacchus]: I surf with the equivalent of 8 condoms on my browser. Most sites don't work without special exceptions. -
[GTBacchus]: What I've got to say about it? Ask specific questions; I'll answer. Otherwise, I don't know what to say other than it's a satirical site that lampoons internet culture of all kinds. What else is there to say? -
[GTBacchus]: I don't know anyone who considers it a \""spam site\"". I know that it's very unpopular here, and not a reliable source for anything. Because of the first of those two reasons, links to there are deprecated here. -
[GTBacchus]: Yes, if you foolishly believe in rules. Super. I hosted their URL for several months after that ArbCom case, with special permission from an arbitrator, because I was trying to overcome the stupidity of \""banning\"" links to a site for stupid reasons. -
[GTBacchus]: Precisely. I get tired of people treating it as an \""attack site\"" worth talking about. Doing so simply inflates their importance, which is not part of our task here. It's best to just ignore it. -
[GTBacchus]: You're preachin' to the choir here, BB. -
[GTBacchus]: Because I'm the one who's an ordained minister? -
[GTBacchus]: I'm George A Jacobs, called \""Tony\"", who lives at [''removed because of web-scraping bots''] in Denton, Texas. I work at UNT, in the math department. Talk to me about \""outing\"". -
[GTBacchus]: Yes, Bugs, I probably know more than you do about our past \""outing\"" cases. Thanks for your concern. I not only have a gun, and know how to use it, but I'm also not a complete idiot online. -
[GTBacchus]: If you think that, then you must not think much of Buddhism. -
[GTBacchus]: Pzrmd, it's just the pain series. What's the big deal? -
[GTBacchus]: Bugs, you're smart not to go back there. Unless you, like I, browse w\/ the equivalent of 8 condoms on, that site will give your computer syphilis. -
[GTBacchus]: Bugs, another thing. If this person had been trying to cast me in a bad light by association with the website, then you amplified the question for him, and broadcast it to the community at large by posting a question at ANI that was ''not'' urgent in any way. Thanks. Please do not reply to threads on my talk page that I haven't had a chance to reply to. If you can't resist replying to posts on this page that don't concern you, then please unwatch my page. This is really annoying. <p> All you had to do was wait another half-hour, and I answered his question. Please don't busybody in my affairs. Thank you. -
[GTBacchus]: Fair enough. I hope you don't feel that I've accused you of that. -
[GTBacchus]: Bugs, I agree it's a fair question to raise. I have an issue with the way you raised it. If you have questions about my participation at any website, just ask. Why you thought Pzrmd's question was a suitable topic to raise at ANI mystifies me. That's not what that page is for. Also, if you want to know whether participation on off-wiki sites is discouraged, just ask that question. There's no reason to add, \""For example, GTBacchus may or may not have an ED account. Let's all look!\"" That's what I find annoying - with no real cause, you just focus a thread on the most drama-intensive page on the site on the question of whether or not I edit Encyclopedia Dramatica. <p> It should be bloody obvious that I'm the same GTBacchus for the following reasons: (1) I've got a screenshot there from when I was logged into WP as an admin, because it's a funny screenshot. That would be tricky to fake. (2) There's the photo of me at [[WP:FACE]], which is also the guy in that photo. (3) I've got my real name on my user page here, and you can search the Web for 18 seconds and find that's what I really look like. (4) There's my talk page there, which it takes only a moment's perusal to convince yourself. (5) There's waiting patiently until the next time I log in and have a chance to ''answer the goddamned question''. <p> Editing at ED is not something I try to hide. I've declared my participation there on my user page here, at I time when I felt (and feel) it was appropriate to do that. I took that note down, when it seemed (as it still seems) appropriate to remove it. If you want to know why I made those choices, please feel free to ask. <p> That said, I don't talk about much here except this encyclopedia, and how we run things here. I don't talk about my politics; I don't talk about my religion. I don't consider those things relevant, because I edit here as an encyclopedist, and not as a Democrat, not as a Republican, not as a Catholic, not as an Atheist, and certainly not as an ED editor. <p> For your information, little squirrel (thought it was rabbit - some kind of [[glire]] anyhow), ED has strict policies against posting personal information that is not already published. They've got a lawyer, it turns out. Their criticism of Wikipedia, as of any topic, is limited to what they enjoy pointing and laughing at. They're very cynical and very vulgar, and occasionally they're brilliant. You would hate the site, I'm certain. They don't share your sense of humor. You and I have at least ''some'' overlap. <p> Wikipedia review is different. They're not there to laugh; they're deadly serious. A lot of them have been banned from here, and that's where they go to not get over it. I understand they've been known to play the outing game, although I'm hardly a reliable source for that statement. <p> Have I answered your questions, Bugs, or is there more I can tell you? -
[GTBacchus]: You are not on my watchlist, and I don't intend to add you to it. -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks, Xeno. I think I chuckled while writing it, too. :) -
[GTBacchus]: It was never quite as dramatic as you characterize it. (\""If you so much as mentioned... etc.\"" This was never true.) That's a load of bullshit. Part of my point back then was proving such tripe to be wrong, because it's precisely that kind of uninformed fear that empowers sites such as Encyclopedia Dramatica and The Wikipedia Review. Those who believed the hype almost made them as powerful as you pretended they were; fortunately, cooler heads prevailed. It was ''never'' verboten to mention ED here, and pretending it was... I've said enough. -
[GTBacchus]: Yes, and at the very same time, I posted their URL on my user page to prove that it wasn't a taboo, and to take wind out of the sails of their would-be empowerers - including Fred Bauder. I was questioned in front of ArbCom about that URL, and I was explicitly told it was appropriate and in good taste. There was never a taboo except for those who wanted one. -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks for this note, Simon. I'm glad to meet you. <p> I appreciate the chance to see through your eyes a bit, and I'm encouraged at your description of areas of Wikipedia that really are relative havens from the drama of ANI, RFA, DRV, ArbCom, etc., etc. I'm reminded of the balmy quietude of the Stub-Sorting project, where I cut my teeth as a new WikiGnome, and the relative calm of Requested Moves, where the worst conflicts we see are over how to spell \""[[Yoghurt]]\"" (which is a surprisingly acrimonious question!). <p> This is a new, unexplored terrain we're on. Nobody's populated a wiki encyclopedia before us, and we've got it all to figure out. I think we're making progress. It's hard to believe it's been over six years since I wrote my first articles ([[Squonk]], and [[Towel]]), because they weren't there yet, and when \""crap gets deleted\"" was the only speedy deletion criterion anyone needed. We've seen a few changes of the guard since those days, and the overall direction is a good one. <p> Thanks again for sharing your thoughts. -
[GTBacchus]: I haven't had a chance to dig far into the links you've given me. I'll have a look, though, and perhaps I'll weigh in, if I think I can say something useful. Thanks for asking about this stuff. I'm glad you're willing to put energy into making the encyclopedia better in an area that I think is under-documented. -
[GTBacchus]: Yes, I wasn't entirely clear there. I didn't mean that it was previously discussed. I mean I removed, and I explained why I removed it. I see what you mean now. <p> I didn't even think I was being bold, so much as being utterly routine. It was like moving an obstruction from a hallway - you just do it. Consensus is not required to refrain from going against usual practice. -
[GTBacchus]: This is an excellent question, or set of questions. I'm going to chew on them for a while before I reply properly. I can say this much now: (A) Consensus is not a numbers game, and most Wikipedians know that. (B) Claims that someone is \""hiding their ignorance behind consensus\"" will tend to alienate uninvolved editors. They would consider that to be against the spirit of [[WP:AGF]]. (C) We don't require that someone shows they've studied a subject before talking about it, but in the articles, we require, as you know, that facts be cited to reliable sources. Deciding which sources those are can be a non-trivial matter. <p> I'll keep thinking about what you've said and asked here. Thanks for your contributions, by the way. -
[GTBacchus]: Actually, I'll be back up there in August. I'm performing a wedding. -
[GTBacchus]: Yeah. I'll get over it. Thanks for the moral support. -
[GTBacchus]: You're right that the personal stake question isn't relevant as to the page move. I asked out of ordinary curiosity. I'm naturally a very curious person. While asking you, I also asked myself the same question - \""why do ''I'' care?\"", and I discovered an answer that seems to make sense. <p> There are some things that raise continual questions, and proposals to change. Sometimes, it's appropriate to assent to these requests; sometimes it isn't. Do you know how often someone proposes that Wikipedia run paid ads, for example? <p> Now, I'm eager to stop talking about this. Are there any further questions I can answer for you before we call it a day? -
[GTBacchus]: I don't know why I'm on the notification list for this one. -
[GTBacchus]: Hmm. I'm not sure what's \""normally\"" done, but my inclination would be to use the drawings to decide what I think the best number is, and then use some algebra to prove that my guess is right. I still have designs on that article, and making the whole thing more accessible. I'd like to know how to make better images for it. -
[GTBacchus]: What about it? It looks kind of long, kind of interesting. -
[GTBacchus]: Actually, depending on the graph, I might do just the opposite, i.e., use algebra (in particular, [[linear programming]], using <s>robot slaves<\/s>computers to do the grunt-work) to come up with a guess, and then play with pictures and symbols to try and prove something general. -
[GTBacchus]: I was just out of town for a couple of days. I'm back now, online, and able to take a look at the situation. Thanks for explaining the background. -
[GTBacchus]: Thank you very much! I've never had my own ''day'' before. I can hardly wait til next year! ;) -
[GTBacchus]: It's no problem. If you do find yourself needing admin help in the future, you're welcome to post here. I can't promise I'll be online, but if I am, I usually respond pretty quickly. Happy editing! -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks for the heads-up. -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks. It's all that talk recently at the civility poll that got me thinking about how uncivil we can be enforcing it. [[User:Tznkai|Tznkai]] says it's easy, and I agree to an extent, but I also find it hard, when I get in the middle of things, not to throw a few punches myself. Live and learn, I guess, and practice makes perfect....<small>(always trust alliterated truisms)<\/small> -
[GTBacchus]: Ah, yes. ''That'' thread. I actually noticed it a couple of days ago, while wondering what WH was up to these days. I'm going to sleep now, but I'll write something here in the morning. Meanwhile, I wish you a good evening. -
[GTBacchus]: I think WH has shown that he has no regard for community standards of courtesy. He has declared that he's not here to work collaboratively, that he doesn't AGF (nor respect anyone who does), and \""fuck off\"" to anyone who questions his behavior. If you set up an RFC about this editor's general behavior, I'll endorse it. (I'm looking at [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment\/WebHamster]] now) I genuinely do not think that civil persuasion will work with some editors, and if we're serious about maintaining a civil atmosphere, appropriate for collaboration, certain people will have to adapt or go. WH represents the particularly intractable end of the uncivil spectrum. If he adapts, I'll buy everyone a pizza, and grin for a week. <p> Right now, the only thing stopping me from posting a thread to ANI with the subject \""Why is this guy allowed to edit here?\"" is that the Dramaout is about to begin. Well... actually, I have an aversion to posting on that page any week of the year, but some situations demand it. Maybe this is one. -
[GTBacchus]: And [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&diff=prev&oldid=302439270 there] you [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:WebHamster&diff=prev&oldid=302439303 go]. I think I found a less contentious way of phrasing it, and I expect a mixed response, as well as several paragraphs of personal abuse directed my way. I won't be online much today and tomorrow, because I'm undergoing day-surgery, and then resting in a house with no Interwebs. I hope I didn't just start a fire, or if I did, that it's a useful one. -
[GTBacchus]: It's no problem. I'm glad to have you on board this crazy boat. We'll get there. :) -
[GTBacchus]: Thank you, stranger. :) -
[GTBacchus]: Hey, maybe we'll even work together on an article someday! My adoptee for the no-drama week is [[socionics]], which has a couple of sections on fire, and a fair amount of gasoline sloshing around. It seems to be a good place to practice the ol' de-escalation. See ya around. :) -
[GTBacchus]: I don't know what you're talking about, but Wikipedia has a policy against making legal threats on this site. Doing so will earn you a hasty block. If you have a legal issue, get a lawyer. -
[GTBacchus]: The edit was clearly out of line. Absent ongoing problems, there is little likelihood of tracking the person down. Many IP addresses are dynamically assigned, and might not be associated with the same computer now that they were 15 minutes ago. Similarly, there's not much use blocking or warning an IP address unless we know that there's actually someone there to block or warn. If there is a pattern of abuse coming from a certain address or range of addresses, then you can bring that up at [[WP:RFCU]], or else they could tell you where. Otherwise, all we can do is write it off as the action of a passing anonymous vandal. It happens all the time, and the most we can do is revert it and forget it. -
[GTBacchus]: I've been offline for a few days. I'll have a look at this, and probably get back to you this evening. -
[GTBacchus]: I'm having a look at the situation. What does \""this is the last opportunity that you'll get\"" mean? -
[GTBacchus]: Which statement of mine are you referring to? Can you point me to it? I'm confused, but as I said, please talk to your lawyer if you have legal concerns. I'll look out for myself; thanks. -
[GTBacchus]: Please either tell me explicitly what you're talking about, or else stop talking about it. -
[GTBacchus]: Oh wow. I haven't looked at that page since... May 3rd, apparently. I pretty much washed my hands of Badagnani then, after failing to mediate between him and others. I see from your ANI post that you've taken up the good work there for a while, and I appreciate that. Kudos and mad props to you. <p> You know... There are a lot of graduate students in the world studying Wikipedia right now. (*waves* HI, WE KNOW YOU'RE THERE!! REMEMBER TO GET SOME SLEEP!!) I'd like to see some science done on questions about how different personality types deal with Wikipedia. There might be some good practical lessons for us in such knowledge. We certainly attract a different demographic of volunteers than, say, the [[Peace Corps]]. We need a DR toolbox, with well-defined tools that we can use deliberately, and record which ones work best. <p> Ah, I dunno. Ultimately, this is an encyclopedia, not a proving-ground for conflict resolution strategies. On the other hand, resolving conflicts is part of collaborating, and if we're going to be doing it, I think it makes sense to pay attention to how we do it, and to do it well. <p> I'll keep an eye on the, uh... Alice situation. Thanks for the heads-up, and for noticing and remembering the essay. -
[GTBacchus]: Hi. I'm just back online after some days, and I'm processing a few things right now. I see the article has been fairly stable. As for the sources page, I'll get there as soon as I can. I expect to be online for the next 12 hours or so, with breaks for meals. <p> The issue seems to be that sections 10 and 11 of the current article are, in the judgment of most editors on the article, bunk. Is that correct, if a tad over-simple? -
[GTBacchus]: How are those vandalism? -
[GTBacchus]: I can see I've got some catching up to do. I'm just off to lunch, but I'll be back online soon. Thanks for your patience. -
[GTBacchus]: I was offline for a while, and I see that someone has blocked him. It's far from obvious to me that it's \""vandalism\""; it looks like the punchline of a joke that begins with misunderstanding, misinformation and miscommunication walking into a bar together. Whatever. -
[GTBacchus]: I'm looking at it now... -
[GTBacchus]: There was a \""|}\"" missing at the end of Season 6. I found it by replacing the whole Season 6 w\/ a copy-paste of Season 5, and when that fixed the problem, I looked more carefully for differences between 5 and 6. Lucky, that. I'm not usually good at these questions. :) -
[GTBacchus]: Cheers-
[GTBacchus]: This is just where I dropped offline two weeks ago. Have there been any developments since then? (Not sure which answer I'd rather hear...) -
[GTBacchus]: Thank you. I'll check my sources when I get home, and weigh in on that. -
[GTBacchus]: ...and I finally log on and read this. I looked at the conversation with BB and CoM, and (masochistic as it sounds) I'm sorry I missed it. Please see my note 2 sections down, regarding my disappearance, and my present effervescence, which is to say, I'm not really here. <p> Thank you for the work you're doing in dispute resolution. We're not yet ''good'' at is, as a community, and progress is slow, but it is progress. <p> I'm off to the reference desk now. I've been trying for the last week to prove that <math>\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\ln(x)}{x^2-1}\\,dx = \\frac{\\pi^2}{4}<\/math>, but I can't make it work. I keep getting imaginary numbers where I shouldn't. -
[GTBacchus]: I've got that watchlisted, and will look in on it. From a cursory inspection, I like the look of it! Anything that makes Wikipedians pay attention to what really works and doesn't work, civility-wise, is a Good Thing. -
[GTBacchus]: I've commented there, thanks. -
[GTBacchus]: The function is actually positive between 0 and 1, because the numerator is also negative. I don't know how one might calculate the separate integrals <math>\\int_0^1f(x)\\,dx<\/math> and <math>\\int_1^\\infty f(x)\\,dx<\/math>. The calculation only works ''because'' it goes all the way from 0 to infinity; anywhere in between, I think we have to resort to numerical approximation. That's because it's evaluated as part of a larger integral, and the other parts of that larger integral only go to zero as the limits of integration go to 0 and infinity. <p> Good stuff! :) -
[GTBacchus]: This thread seems to have dropped off my radar recently. I apologize for not getting back to you sooner. I'll mention that \""asking editors to strike out their inappropriate remarks\"" is something that requires a high level of diplomacy, and if you are the target of those remarks, is roughly 100% likely to worsen the situation. Try to put yourself in other people's shoes. What would be ''likely'' to inspire a courteous reaction? <p> Your complaints here are about situations you can resolve on your own. Just don't adopt a combative mentality. <p> Also, think about where I'm coming from. It's very clear and easy to say \""don't call people 'fucking morons'\"", that's a no-brainer. It's obvious that using such language will never improve any situation, and it's so flagrant that it leads to a clear and firm warning, as you received. Never talk that way on Wikipedia, and if you do, expect things to go badly for you. Count on it. <p> Now, you complain that someone \""accuses you of 'WP:IDIDNTHEARTHAT' while being guilty of it himself.\"" That might be true. Pretty much anytime anyone accuses someone of \""IDIDNTHEARTHAT\"", it's code for \""I'm right and you're not admitting it.\"" Duh. He says you're stubbornly wrong, and you say that, because he's stubbornly wrong, that's a personal attack? It's not a personal attack; it's just stupid. He's stupid to mention WP:IDIDNTHEARTHAT, because that's a stupid essay, cited by people who don't realize how useless it is, and how escalatory such accusations are. That's because a lot of Wikipedians aren't very focused on dispute ''resolution'' they're focused on winning. <p> Be the other kind of Wikipedian, and watch your experience here change for the better by orders of magnitude. I'll comment further at ArbCom. You've got to learn to play Wikiball as if you want to contribute, and not as if you want to be banned. It's a skill; learn it. The surprise is that you get there by being '''good''', and by '''never''' letting your focus shift from edits to personalities. Play like you want to win, not like you want to go down in flames. -
[GTBacchus]: I haven't said it isn't a reliable source, but I have replied at the talk page there. I'm not on some \""side\"" of this question. I came into the situation with the impression that sources are lacking, but since I'm not an expert in that, I've posted a question to the noticeboard. There's no need to talk about it in multiple places, you know. I'll watch the 4chan talk page. -
[GTBacchus]: I only just now saw this message. I'll pop over and see if anything is still happening... -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks for the heads-up. I've moved the page. -
[GTBacchus]: Nice article; could use some copyediting. What's bothering you about it? -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks for the heads-up. I do enjoy the occasional foray into the woods of AFD, and my wiki-adventures of late haven't been taking me there. <p> I'm always struck by how easily people will be distracted from their goal when the opportunity presents itself to disparage an opponent. That gentleman on the talk page with the sources, wondering why such-and-such was \""ignored\"" when nominating the article for deletion... Where's the fun in adding sources to an article when you can identify a \""bad guy\"" instead, right? Aren't we a funny species? -
[GTBacchus]: I replied at the second of your posted links. It'll have to wait a few hours, but I'll see what I can add. -
[GTBacchus]: You're certainly more than welcome to fix any typo I make, anywhere on the project. I appreciate your leaving me a note about it here. As for the arbitration case itself, let's talk about that on the pages set up for it, ok? -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks for the note. I've commented in both locations. -
[GTBacchus]: I'll just add here that I've never seen a case where so-called \""callling a spade a spade\"" has led to any good result. We're here for good results; and nothing more nor less than that. I have also never seen any situation where making a determination about another editor's good faith has ever led to any good result. It's useless at best. I do not in any way deny that [[User:Quale]] is \""mature and conscientious\""; I assume he is precisely that.  -
[GTBacchus]: No worries. I think Jimbo's talk page is a bit of a free-for-all anyway. :) -
[GTBacchus]: Hello. I just noticed this, and I'd like to apologize for failing to inform you when I mentioned you in the evidence I presented. This is my first time posting to an ArbCom case, and I completely forgot to inform people that I'd mentioned them. I'm glad Sjakkalle thought to let you know. -
[GTBacchus]: I'm happy that I said something that resonated with you, and simultaneously a little puzzled. You thought I was more of an inclusionist? I've never really identified with either end of that spectrum, taking things on a more case-by-case basis. ''Am'' I an inclusionist after all? The idea about automatic links to some sensible Google searches seems good to me, or at least good enough not to abort before trying it. -
[GTBacchus]: That's a cool template. I guess what I would like to see is something it would be difficult to scrape, and that's a critical evaluation of the sources. To me, a count is much less important than whether the sources are independent and reliable, and whether the coverage really is non-trivial (i.e., someone actually writing ''about'' the topic, as opposed to mentioning it). <p> I have seen it happen in deletion discussions that people say \""see, we have hits in Google books, therefore the topic is ''clearly'' notable\"". I find that to be the flipside of arguing that \""Google counts are ''meaningless''\"". Both (all too common) arguments are flawed, and neither can be repaired except through careful critical evaluation. <p> Another concern is that the byline \""Brought to you by the article rescue squadron\"" will tend to alienate a certain segment of the community. The idea that there is a \""squadron\"" (sounds military) devoted to \""rescuing\"" (instead of critically evaluating) articles is going to come across to a lot of people as a kind of blind inclusionism. I would hate to see the work you've done discounted on those grounds. <p> It seems to me that a big part of proposing new processes and mechanism at Wikipedia is ''selling'' them to the community. Anything that makes them difficult to sell ends up working against you. The two things I could see alienating a lot of users are the \""squadron\"" byline, and the G-links being presented as numbers. These aren't liabilities of the tool, as a tool; they're only liabilities because they might stack the deck against the community accepting the tool. <p> I dunno, does that all make sense? -
[GTBacchus]: Well, I'm unlikely to do anything \""aggressively\"". That's not really my style. I \""could see\"" lots of things done aggressively that, it turns out, aren't. <p> I agree that userfying should be reserved for articles that someone realistically believes they have a chance of improving to standards. I suspect most people would be unlikely to ask to have articles userfied that they don't have definite plans to improve. After all, the goal is to get articles into the 'Pedia, and not into a non-indexed space where nobody will read them. I would find it very bizarre if someone were to simply accumulate stub after stub in their user-space, where the public will never see them. That would seem strangely OCD to me. <p> Of course, we're just comparing our predictions about what \""lots of people would do\"", and I see no ''a priori'' reason to favor your prediction OR mine. The standard way to find out what \""would\"" happen is to try it and see what happens. I'd be comfortable doing the legwork of deletion if such a plan were tried and led somewhere bad. I'm not going to be irresponsible about it. <p> I would be more interested in userfying articles for article rescuers with proven records of bringing articles up to snuff. Perhaps a cap on the number of articles one user could keep in a user-space limbo at a time would help. I'm certainly a lot more interested in finding things that could work than in guessing why they might not. I'm looking for solutions, not reasons to not bother trying. Ten years ago, if someone had said, \""let's start an online encyclopedia that's editable by members of the public,\"" it would have been very easy to say, \""I know good intention, but could see it misused aggressively.\"" Very few things aren't worth a try. <p> What I'm really interested in is avoiding the sterile debates that happen in so many AFDs: \""'''Keep''' - clearly notable\"" \/ \""'''Delete''' clearly non-notable\"". Once those positions are laid out, the inclusionist will gain nothing but frustration by arguing at AFD. I want to let the inclusionists know that such arguments are a pointless waste of time, and that there are altogether smarter options. -
[GTBacchus]: Ah, you know. In these discussions, I don't necessarily know who's who. These issues about AfD culture interest me. I'm glad there's a robust discussion going on. -
[GTBacchus]: Offends? Do I seem upset? I've had a smile on my face this whole time. I also caught your response already. I'm aware of more than two uses of quotation marks, but I was a bit puzzled by yours. Puzzled != offended. I'm raising a glass to you now; cheers, and may the road rise to meet you. :) -
[GTBacchus]: Yeah last night's \u20ac\u20ac \xabpoor red wine\xbb led to a poor mo(u)rning this morning. not that I wo(uld)n't do it again... \xa1I don't use some [\xbf\u2153,\u215c?] of these symbols nearly enough! -
[GTBacchus]: You're welcome. Maybe things will work out. -
[GTBacchus]: I like that it's a creative solution I haven't seen mooted before. I'm going to think about this. Just now, I'm off to get some coffee in me and attend a lecture, but I'll be back online soon. Cheers. :) -
[GTBacchus]: I think community presentation is a bad idea. When ideas such as this are mooted to the community, everyone puts on their \""It'll never fly, Wilbur\""-hats, and proceed to dream up every possible disadvantage. As I often say, if we had said ten years ago, \""let's make an online encyclopedia that's freely editable by members of the public\"", we would have been absolutely drowned in reasons why that would never work. <p> In my experience, it's better to do what Wales and Sanger did - don't ask anyone's permission; just start doing it. The details are better worked out in the field than on the drawing board (just like with aviation). Then, when it works, the unbelievers have no choice but to get on board. <p> By the way, I've taken this idea, started calling it an article \""incubator\"", and mentioned it in the discussion back at [[WT:AFD]]. Now I'm going to go and mention that it's your idea, not mine! -
[GTBacchus]: Yeah, we'll need to make a page, write some text indicating what it's for, and then find a way to start farming actual articles from AfD into it. I wonder if the kids over at the \""Article Rescue Squadron\"" would be a good group to work with in setting this up? <p> I have to go study some mathematics now, but I'll be back online in a few hours, and we'll keep thinking about this. If you're inspired to push forward in the meanwhile, cool. <p> We'll need a clever shortcut, of course. Nothing survives without one of those (eyes roll). A natural choice might be... [[WP:INCUBATE]]? Oh good; it's red. -
[GTBacchus]: Ok, it's a fresh new day where I'm staying, and I know more mathematics than I did yesterday. I was worried when I couldn't remember how to prove that two topologies are equivalent, but then I remembered. :) <p> Now, I'm imagining a process working this way: there's a central page, linked from the shortcut. We can call it a \""Newpage Incubator\"", or something. Articles can be moved to sub-pages of that page, and linked in a list from that page. Each article will have some kind of template at the top, which will include the {{tl|NOINDEX}} code to protect the tender seedlings from the harsh, merciless flood-lamps by which Google's pigeons slave through the night. A page sitting in the incubator for a certain  amount of time (fairly generous, but to be determined in the field) will have to go to AFD after all, or we might just euthanize them on site at the incubator. (Love these metaphors!) <p> That all seems pretty straightforward. It would also be cool if we could automatically identify premature births in need of incubation. I notice that article-rescuers seem particularly upset when articles are nominated for deletion within a few minutes of being created. Perhaps there's a way we could scan new AfDs and find the ones where the time between creation and nomination is less than some small number (again to be determined in the field; maybe we'd start at 1 day). We could harvest those by yanking them from AfD before the vitriol has time to set in. Eventually, this could perhaps be automated, or at least semi-automated. <p> How does that sound, as a sketch of a process? If it works well enough, then eventually newpage patrollers could send pages directly to the incubator, instead of going through AfD. <p> Another thought: the PROD template might be a good place to mention about [[WP:INCUBATE]], although I'd hold off on that until we see some success rate. <p> For now, I'm going to drop off a note at [[WT:RESCUE]] -
[GTBacchus]: I agree. -
[GTBacchus]: Excellent. If anyone MfDs it before I get back this evening, I'm gonna Ignore All Rules all over 'em! ;) -
[GTBacchus]: Aw gee, I've hardly had time to think about it. If you love life, don't look at [[WT:NC]] anytime soon. Christ, I hate it when... never mind. <p> I think I'll post a couple of notes about this debate idea. It doesn't make me want to tear anything out. <p> By the way, I've made a lot of edits at [[WP:INCUBATE]], and even told someone unrelated about it, following an acrimonious deletion discussion. We don't want to expose it too fast to nay-sayers, but we do want robust input from a variety of users. It's a balance to strike... -
[GTBacchus]: Check the page again. I screwed up, mixed up PBS and PMA, and I've apologized, both personally to PBS and publicly at [[WT:NC]]. I'm stepping away from that page for a bit now. -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks for the note. -
[GTBacchus]: Would you have any interest in participating in something like this? -
[GTBacchus]: Wait... you're gone? Oh hell. -
[GTBacchus]: Thank you for filing this, and for letting me know. -
[GTBacchus]: Thank you. :) I do hope it grows into something that can really help the project. I think it's got potential. -
[GTBacchus]: Did I make it red? Oh Lord, I started with [[Lake Woebegone]], which is at least a redirect, and then half-fixed, only removing the first 'e'. I guess I'd better make another redirect now. <p> No worries, of course, about the \""somewhat bad form\"". As [[Mick Jagger|the poet]] [[Stray Cat Blues|said]], It's no hanging matter. :) -
[GTBacchus]: Ah, why not? Where are you thinking of pulling them from first? -
[GTBacchus]: Eh, no worries. I was pretty sure I'd seen your name around, but I tend not to follow many ArbCom cases. I'm glad you're here, and presumably street legal. :) -
[GTBacchus]: I could go on and on, but I don't want to overwhelm you. The main thing is to know that you're very welcome here, and that you can learn a lot by just trying stuff. You're certainly welcome to ask me about any specific question you have. <p> Happy editing! -
[GTBacchus]: Huh. Well, I'll strike that part. I would still contend that many perceive it as a racist allusion, which is just about as damaging as if it really were one. -
[GTBacchus]: I don't care what you acknowledge. I didn't attack your mental health - every healthy human on Earth engages in neurotic needs occasionally. I'm a bipolar and a drunk; deal with it. If you think you can have me desysopped for stopping a rampage of personal attacks.... cool. -
[GTBacchus]: I know, right? I'm usually so bored... No wonder I drink. -
[GTBacchus]: Um, sure. I'm not drunk right now, I don't edit loaded, and I think whatsisname is not watching. That's what he said, and I'm sure as hell not going to call him a liar. Nor have I tried to justif... what are you talking about? I can self-deprecate all I want! I'm a terrible editor! Why do people listen to me? -
[GTBacchus]: Maybe if I launch into a 9-paragraph screed... -
[GTBacchus]: Admin cannibalism? Heresy on ANI? This is something I should have known about! I'm still baffled at the idea that \""I'm a drunk\"" was supposed to justify anything... -
[GTBacchus]: \""Extraordinary article-building expertise\""? Unamusing. If you want to drop off notes about articles you think I can help with, in my minimal, gnomish way, leave out the jabs, eh? If you're trying to say something else, it's coming across as weird, veiled sarcasm. -
[GTBacchus]: No, you think I'm bad at stuff. You disagree with \""my approach\"", remember? I discuss way too much to be of any use as a mentor. Apparently, I think everyone should stop writing and discuss. If you can't shoot straight with me, go away. If this is your way of saying... something else, just say it. Tone comes across badly online. <p> Go write an article. There's an [[Wikipedia:Article Incubator]] slowly filling with stubs that could use your attention. You ''are'' good at that; no sarcasm, no joke. -
[GTBacchus]: Sure. Let me see what I can do. -
[GTBacchus]: Considering I barely know what the article's about, I think I made some pretty reasonable changes to make it more accessible. It's not close to FA status yet... -
[GTBacchus]: Well, remember that you're online. If you're going to mix in \""comedy\"" about people's writing skills (Who on Earth enjoys being the butt of that?) with otherwise sincere posts, you're going to confuse and offend people. If you don't think much of my writing - or lack thereof - then either stick to that, or don't mention it. Pretend praise ''just isn't funny''. Memorize that, and you'll piss off fewer people. -
[GTBacchus]: First of all, it is math related. Secondly, it's not like we're on buddy-buddy terms. I genuinely cannot tell whether you have any respect for me or not. You've made it pretty clear that you disagree with a lot of what I say and do, and you've never made it apparent that you think anything good about me without veiling it in \""comedy\"". What makes you think I like you enough to put up with that kind of shit? Your attempt at humor managed to hurt my feelings, first thing in the morning. Congratulations. My day was worse, because you laughed at me. <p> Why do I say you laughed at me? I'm getting that from \""''I'll only laugh at myself in the future''\"". That indicates that you were laughing at someone else - Whom? Get it? Laugh ''with'', not ''at''. Since you and I clearly don't share a sense of humor, don't try. You're bad at it. <p> You still dickishly think I'm all about discussion. I'm not, you're wrong or lying, and I don't like you at all. I respect your dedication to the project, but I think you are socially clueless. Your attempts to be friendly come off as offensive. I want you to stop posting to my talk page. Okay? <p> You seem to still think that when I said, \""you don't have to discuss so much,\"" I meant, \""you should discuss more\"". That's incomprehensibly clueless to me. You think I want you to be like me. Ugh. Please - lay off the discussion. You're bad at it, and you do too much of it, while bizarrely claiming that you'd rather not. Take a look at yourself man. Start walking the walk you talk. -
[GTBacchus]: Ok... maybe let's be careful in AfDs in the future not to suggest or support userfying articles unless they really seem to have a chance. Voting \""delete\"" is probably the best, most merciful, thing to do in those cases. Deletion isn't \""mean\"". <p> As for this one, let's give it some time. The deadlines I'm thinking of are in the 1-3 month range. Print sources exist, maybe not for this, but maybe. Have you tried a bricks-and-books library? A rush to decide that it will never graduate is no better than a rush to delete it in the first place, or a rush to save it without careful consideration. In 2 months, someone could come up with a non-online technical journal. Either way, let's decide in about 2 months. <p> For now, if there's already a mainspace redirect from [[Eie-manager]] to [[Norton Commander]], super. If not, let's not create one unless [[Norton Commander]] actually mentions Eie-manager. Otherwise, that will just confuse people. No hits at all is a better search result than an unexplained redirect. <p> I don't think we need to be putting articles up for deletion anyway. Most of our clients have already failed that test; no sense repeating. <p> I guess that's what I think. Please be careful about what you userfy. I've been trusting you on that. -
[GTBacchus]: Cheers. :) I wonder if there's a solution for any number of sons.... kinda think there is... but I don't quite feel like trying to prove that. That ''was'' fun though, and that farmer should get his head examined! -
[GTBacchus]: Ah, y'know. It's one way to start a discussion, and we get input from people we wouldn't otherwise. The MFD will run its natural course, and see what happens. Do unto others, right? -
[GTBacchus]: For the vote of confidence. :) -
[GTBacchus]: ...will be thousands of miles from here. The taxi has arrived. Ciao. -
[GTBacchus]: Made it. About to sleep. -
[GTBacchus]: Hi Tothwolf. As I'm posting below, I've just beamed off the planet, as far as regular Wikipedia participation goes. I hope another admin was able to help you. -
[GTBacchus]: I wasn't aware; thanks for pointing that out. :\/ -
[GTBacchus]: Looking into the situation, I would have liked to see some indication of the previous closure and reversion thereof. That said, I see no reason to revert the move now. If the editor in question is showing some interest in otherwise inactive projects, and can maybe get some activity going in them, I say let him move 'em around. -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks for replying. I can see how using a very small screen would make things awkward. I'm such a Luddite, my telephone is only good as a calculator, stopwatch, calendar, address book, alarm clock, and... what is it?... oh, making telephone calls. ;) I can't browse the 'Net with it, so I probably fail to appreciate those limitations. -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks for the note. I just got back from dinner, and I'll have a look. -
[GTBacchus]: I hope you realize... most of this is meaningless to me. I don't buy 1\/3 of the complaints I get about other editors; I look into it. You needn't worry that I'll get the wrong idea, because I'm not an idiot. I can read time stamps, for example. <p> SkagitRiverQueen, it appears that the posts you're talking about occurred before our agreements on WQA earlier. Let's let bygones be bygones now. Pursuing this further is disruptive. Focus on edits; stop talking about each other. Both of you. Blocks will follow, soon. The first one to '''drop it''' wins. Win, now. So far, you're both losing, because you're continuing to talk about the other. <p> SkagitRiverQueen, you are not injured by these posts of Wildharlivie. Wildhartlivie, you are not injured by these posts of SkagitRiverQueen. What is so hard about '''dropping it'''? Race each other to be first. Drop it for good, and leave it dropped. Get good at ignoring crap. Do it now. Neither of you will be happy if this escalates, so get good at turning the other cheek. Start now. -
[GTBacchus]: It's just that the water you're talking about was already under the bridge. I've made that kind of mistake, too; it happens. Let's get past it now. You're not in trouble, and you're not being blamed for anything. Just let's move on. Wildhartlivie ''seems'' to be willing to let it go, so let's meet him halfway on that, and let it go. Okay? Shouldn't we be talking about Ted Bundy by now? -
[GTBacchus]: Happy new year to you too. :) I've deleted those pages; let me know if I missed anything. -
[GTBacchus]: I've also posted at WQA; please feel free to contact me directly if this editor continues with the name-calling and racist characterizations of entire nations (or anything along those lines). I'm an admin willing to act in such situations. -
[GTBacchus]: It's no problem. Take care. :) -
[GTBacchus]: Hi. There are quite a few of us who are willing to block for as few as 1 or 2 vandalistic edits, when their nature is extremely clear and the user has no productive history. This user has been around for a while, but the warnings on their talk page now are certainly sufficient for us to issue a block at the next \""nazi\"" or otherwise clearly disruptive edit. <p> When I said that I rarely use those templates with registered users, I just meant that I type out a warning instead. The templates, I use for IP's, but for people with names, I think the human touch makes a huge difference. What Floquenbeam wrote counts as a level-4 warning. <p> I'd say a fine way, as a non-admin, to deal with this kind of situation is something like: (A) One note on their talk page, preferably not a template, (B) notify admins. <p> The latter can be done various ways, with different possible outcomes. If you post to AN\/I, you may get an instant positive response, or you may be crushed under boulders before you know what happened. Posting to WQA is often helpful, although you'll sometimes draw the kind of response where they ignore the information you're bringing and attack you. I don't know anything about AIV; I've never used that board. <p> Keeping an admin or two on your speed-dial is a pretty good way - you're certainly welcome to tug on ''my'' sleeve - because it can be someone you already know. The trouble is that we're not each always online. <p> One more idea, and then I'll stop typing: The talk page of the article where the vandalism occurred is likely to be populated by editors who don't like seeing that article vandalized, and one or more of them might be admins. I hope these suggestions are helpful; thank you for helping to protect the Wiki! -
[GTBacchus]: I've replied to your note at my talk page. :) -
[GTBacchus]: Huh. I guess I misunderstood about the warning. I'll go back and see if I should refactor that comment. I agree that you and Ronz avoiding each other is a fine idea. I would suggest that you'll get there faster if you refrain from repeating accusations against him, because those tend to prolong, rather than end, our interactions with those we wish to avoid. Pretend he doesn't exist, perhaps? When someone talks about me and my \""aggressive behavior,\"" I'm almost certain to reply in my own defense, and I'm unlikely to go away until I know they've stopped talking about me. -
[GTBacchus]: It's no problem. :) -
[GTBacchus]: Replied at your talk page. -
[GTBacchus]: Replied. :) -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks, Ikip. I'm all too aware of my bungled attempts at diplomacy, so I'm glad I come across right some percentage of the time. I guess I.... I dunno, love this project or something. Pain in the neck, isn't it, caring about stuff? ;) -
[GTBacchus]: I'm about to sleep, and tomorrow I'm taking a Ph.D. qualifying exam for 8 hours. After that, I might have a chance to log on and look at this situation, or I might not. After the next two days, I'll be made of free time. <p> If you haven't been canvassing, then overt accusations of canvassing are pretty harmless. They're not going to get in the way of your editing; so I'd ignore them if you can. If you must respond, just respond in context, note that you haven't been canvassing, and try not to hit back with ''any kind of accusation at all''. <p> The idea is not to be right, not to have the last word, not to let the truth be said. The idea is to end the dispute, and the first one to stop entirely '''wins'''. Try winning. If she's out of line, eventually there will be people enough to file an RfC, etc. Otherwise, we all just move on. If you knew the insults I've refrained from replying to on this website... The winner is the one who ignores, rises above, and edits the encyclopedia. I speak from experience. -
[GTBacchus]: Off to school now... thanks for the kind wishes! :) -
[GTBacchus]: Thank you, Olive. I think it did go well. I should find out within a week :) -
[GTBacchus]: It's in mathematics. This particular qualifying exam covered algebra - [[abstract algebra|abstract]] and [[linear algebra|linear]]. My specialization is going to be [[number theory]], but first there's a core curriculm to work through. Gettin' there :). <p> As for now... I've got a little bit of free time to put in some Wikipedia work. There's an article I'd like to write before classes resume, so we'll see about that. -
[GTBacchus]: ...why not take full advantage of that fact? Why undermine yourself? Wouldn't it be better not to do that? Come on, make it easy for me to support you. -
[GTBacchus]: I don't think you're kidding, but I don't think you're helping yourself as well as you can, either. If you're serious about that monograph, your ''smartest'' strategy is to not mention it. That's if you want things to be easy, not hard. Your call. -
[GTBacchus]: Hi. I'm not sure what to tell you. I generally recommend dealing with edits on their own terms, and letting the personal stuff come out in the wash. What I'm hearing from you is that you don't feel that's working. My usual advice at that point is to go ahead and file the RfC, because carrying that stuff around doesn't help anyone. <p> If you're willing to accept informal mediation, I can do that, but otherwise, I can't really tell you anything I haven't already said. If you want the mediation, I've got conditions that have to be acceptable to all parties, but I won't start that conversation unless someone asks me to. <p> Potentially, having someone challenge your edits is a blessing, because it makes everything better, but if the chemistry isn't there, that never really comes to be. I don't know; what would you like to hear from me? What do you seek, posting here? In other words: I hear what you're saying; how can I help you? -
[GTBacchus]: I think it's safe to say she's watching here. Let's see what happens. -
[GTBacchus]: I think I've cleared up all the spurious pages. Let me know if I missed anything. -
[GTBacchus]: \""Fl\xe2neur\"", wow. That's cool, and I like any connotation or shade of meaning that Baudelaire is personally responsible for. That guy possessed a roommate of mine when I was an undergrad - creepy! I'm glad ''I'' wrote on [[David Hume|Hume]]; he can inhabit your soul and you're still functional... <p> Anyway. I understand why you would react to that post I made. I prefer not to post to Wikipedia when I'm feeling strongly enough to talk that way, and I advise others not to post when they're feeling that way. However, I'm not always able to follow all my own advice (nor Hume's). My \""wanting him gone\"" is an expression of my pessimism that he'll understand and adapt, and my anger with myself for screwing up when I tried to mediate the situation. I find myself wanting the whole situation to go away, in the form of Badagnani leaving, so that's how it comes out when I'm venting. It's not the best side of me, but I'm not going to deny anything I've expressed. That's how I was feeling, right then, and I still feel a good chunk of that way. It's not right or wrong; it is what it is. <p> My being wrong in this case would be really cool, and I'm ready to eat as much pride as would be called for in that event. I have no idea what could make it happen, though. <p> I thank you, Quiddity, for the invitation to ramble; I'll stop now. Take care. -
[GTBacchus]: Crohnie, I'm not sure which episode you're referring to, about an IP and an edit that might or might not have been vandalism. There was an IP messing around on [[Talk:Black Dahlia]] last night, and if I hadn't gone to sleep when I did, they would have been blocked a ''lot'' sooner than they were. That was a bunch of nonsense, but I didn't see any relation to SkagitRiverQueen. I'm sure I haven't seen the whole story. <p> I'm in touch with SkagitRiverQueen, and we'll see what happens. If enough people think it's time to file an RfC\/U, then there will be an RfC\/U. Personally, I think it's possible for everyone to back away from this conflict, but we'll see what everyone does. -
[GTBacchus]: Yes, I'm just not sure that SRQ is actually following WHL from article to article. I think their areas of interest overlap in crime biographies, and there's no rule against that. There's a possibility of [[confirmation bias]], because any edit that SRQ makes to one of WHL's watchlisted articles is going to appear to WHL as stalking - that doesn't mean it is. Ultimately, these two are going to have to work alongside each other, and that means no restraining orders. Wildhartlivie is going to have to tolerate SkagitRiverQueen's presence, and ''vice-versa''. <p> As for all conversations happening on-wiki, both of these parties have emailed me, and I'm willing to be an off-wiki sounding board if either of them needs it. Venting one's frustration is not always best done publicly. <p> The fact is, SRQ is ''going'' to edit articles that WHL edits. WHL is ''going'' to edit articles that SRQ edits. Any disputes that arise on these articles are ultimately about content, and not about people. If both parties can keep a razor-focus on edits, then the conflict is already over. If Wildhartlivie sees SkagitRiverQueen revert something, the real question is, \""was it a good edit or not?\"" That question has nothing to do with \""WP:HOUND\"" or any other behavior policy. <p> Do you see my position here? -
[GTBacchus]: \""''The poking also needs to be stopped''\"". Aaaaaa-men. It helps a little to remember that button-pushing tends to be a response to feeling persecuted and powerless. That feeling exists on both sides; we're all made of the same stuff. The Catholics and Protestants managed to stop shooting each other in Ireland; surely a few Wikipedia editors can stop poking each other. We're all on the same team, and our common opponent is ignorance. -
[GTBacchus]: I didn't say it was extreme. I think you can appreciate what I'm trying to do though, yes? -
[GTBacchus]: I think there's truth in what you say. I try to give uniform advice all around, and you can be sure that I'll notice and reply to any content that seems not to be focused on improving the article. People need to vent when they're frustrated; a big part of the trick is separating that from the work. The cycle of remark, followed by protest, followed by response to protest... etc. \u2014 that cycle's got to be broken, eventually, or at least moved to somewhere else. However, until it's actually time to file an AN\/I or WQA or RFC\/U, there's really not much to say that's going to help. <p> If we can't find a path to peaceful editing, then it's gonna have to escalate somewhere, but I'm not close to that point yet. I've seen worse problems worked out on this wiki. -
[GTBacchus]: Yes, that's a totally fair question. SRQ and I are in touch via email, but I could post something to her talk page here, if that display of uniformity would be helpful. I figure I've addressed her pretty directly right on the talk page, too. I get the feeling that she feels rather persecuted on that page, and it's good for her to see that I'm looking at everyone's participation. <p> I understand that you've already gone through a lot of your patience in this situation, but to do what I do, I've got to make a good-faith attempt to work it out without escalating to any formal DR. If nothing works, then I'll be there to give a neutral account of how it all went wrong. I don't assume we'll go south, though. (If I did, I'd be a pretty bad mediator!) -
[GTBacchus]: I've been offline for the last couple of days; I'm sorry to have missed so much. I'm very, very tired right now, but I'll be back tomorrow, and look in on what's going on. I hope everyone has the best evening they're able to, and I'll see you all soon. -
[GTBacchus]: I'm comfortable with that talk page being archived, but I know nothing about archive bots and their settings. Sorry I can't help with that. -
[GTBacchus]: I'm trying to figure out why you've been yelling at me, honestly. You've seemed hostile from the start, ''and'' I don't understand where you're coming from. I'm completely ready to work together with you, but so far you've avoided answering questions I've asked. What's up? <p> I'm not trying to tell you what to do. I'm trying to understand why you, who clearly have other things to do in your life, are doing something the extremely hard, time-intensive way, instead of the sensible, quick way. <p> If you think a topic is non-notable, then nominating the article for deletion is the ''sensible'' way to react. ''Not'' nominating it for deletion means you want to spend enormously more time arguing about it. That makes no sense. <p> If you think an article needs fixing, you have many options -- many that are legal, in terms of any policy you care to cite. One option is to make the edit that needs to be made, and then work from there. Another option is to simply yell at people (like myself) arriving at the talk page who try to ask what's going on. You seem to have chosen the latter, and I don't know why. <p> My ears are wide open, and I want to fix the article that you want to fix. Do you want to argue with me more, or do you want to accept the support I'm offering you? Do you want to waste time, or get something done? Why? -
[GTBacchus]: I'm ready to work with you. See detailed reply at my talk page. If you think the thing's non-notable, you can pursue the time-wasting strategy, or the time-saving strategy. Up to you. -
[GTBacchus]: Are you trying to improve the article, or to use its talk page as a forum to argue? If you're trying to improve the article, can you show me what edit you'd like to see made? So far, I've seen you accuse and IP of being a sock, I've seen you edit war, and I've seen you ask a completely irrelevant question about whether reliable sources \""recommend\"" the book, when that has no connection to any policy that I know of. -
[GTBacchus]: I've been offline for some time. I think I took an entirely inappropriate tone on the talk page there, and I apologize for going off on you. <p> I don't know whether the book is notable or not. I think that the proper way to test that question is by running an AfD, which is a perfectly legitimate and good-faith thing to do. It's ''how'' we question notability, if simply asking the question on the talk page doesn't work. <p> There is a clear and objective criterion to meet - if you're asserting the non-notability of the book, then you're saying it doesn't meet that criterion. That's what you're saying, right? In that case, I can see no reason to delay the article's deletion. We're not trying to keep articles on non-notable topics so people can argue about them. Flush it out, and get on with something notable. <p> If, on the other hand, the book ''does'' meet our notability criterion, then there's no sense continuing to claim that it's non-notable. It's not really a matter of opinion; the criterion is objective. Thus, there's no sense arguing about it. We just answer the question: yes or no? -
[GTBacchus]: I don't understand why adding the list without also including responses is even on the table. Why not just add the list ''and'' critical responses? <p> Whether mentioning someone's presence on the list alone violates BLP is a question I'd like to see asked before a larger audience. I haven't personally seen how we handle any similar cases. I'd be curious what people at [[WT:BLP]] would say, or the people at [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Biography|WikiProject Biography]]. In the meantime, since there is a a potential BLP issue, it seems that we should err on the side of ''not'' including the full list until we've obtained more input and seen a consensus emerge. <p> That said, any documented replies by professors on the list indicate that those professors have publicly acknowledged their being in the book. Documenting their response necessarily reveals that they are, in fact, in the book. -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks for the freebie. :) <p> There is no reason to edit war, ever. I tried my damndest to help with the Manson situation, and when we finally wrangled the discussion back on topic, you vanished. I was really disappointed. From where I'm sitting, it was you who blew me off. You wiped your ass with my advice. <p> Regarding your point (2), I don't take orders. Thanks for understanding. Regarding point (4), there is no excuse to revert ONE time, much less to play someone right to the edge, and then say \""3RR is now in effect\"". \""Don't ever edit war\"" is always in effect, and edit summaries like that should never be made. Edit summaries are not for talking about the other person (which you '''still''' foolishly do); they are for explaining constructive article edits. Reverts are nonsense, and you'd be very smart to NEVER REVERT ANY ARTICLE. Ever. (See, I can do the cute \""Ever.\"" thing, too! :p ) <p> I didn't blow you off. You walked away after I took hours and hours out of my life to help you. You bitched and moaned about everyone reverting you, and when we finally got the talk page to a place where we could talk about the goddamned edits already, you evaporated. That disappoints me. Yes this is repetition. I was very disappointed. <p> I trust neither of you will ask me for help again, because you can be sure I've said my bit. You (just like your best friend WHL) have the solution to all disputes in your hands, but you refuse to use it. I don't give a shit. -
[GTBacchus]: I was honest the whole time; don't flatter yourself that I have any reason to lie to you. I became upset because after I went out of my way for you, you blew me off, wiped your ass with my advice, and kept editing foolishly. Therefore, I wash my hands. I'll refrain from saying \""I told you so\"" when it catches up with you. You can just consider it already said, now. Bye. I'm off to watchlist your RFC, and these other cats' RFCs. <p> Who I *really* am is both the person who's willing to go out of his way to help, and also the person who becomes hurt and upset when his assistance is shit upon. (That's what you did.) You pissed me off, because I'm imperfect and prone to being pissed off by some things. I don't like it. <p> I consider this discussion over. -
[GTBacchus]: To be fair, her criticism of my \""bull-in-a-china-shop\"" post to her talk page is perfectly fair and correct. That posting was both intemperate and extremely unlikely to be helpful. I sometimes stop myself before posting that kind of shit, but today I failed. -
[GTBacchus]: I wouldn't say that not expecting to hear from you was the \""goal\"", no. I was pissed off, and the goal was venting those feelings. It's not a very worthwhile goal, is it? <p> At this point, yeah, I'm done with the situation. You have complete power to cure and fix the situation once and forever, by simply sticking to some basic rules of Wikipedia Chess. You and SRQ have shown yourselves unwilling or unable to do that, and at that point, I '''can't''' help. If I try, I fuck things up instead. Admins are not cops: expecting cop-like behavior is misguided, and when we act cop-like, we suck at everything. <p> If you won't do what it takes to solve your problems, then leave other people out of it. None of us can help you to help yourself. You have to be willing to do it. So far, you haven't been. I threw you a line, and you ignored it, so you're on your own. I don't get paid enough to deal with this bullshit. <p> Expect things from admins; you'll end up sad. Take the solution into your own hands and do what's right; you'll end up happy. I don't care which one you choose. -
[GTBacchus]: And here ''you'' are, going on and on with the ''ad hominems''. None of you wants this shit to end, do you? Fighting is ''so much'' more fun than collaborating. '''ALL''' remarks about other editors are worthless shit, always. From me, from you, from anyone: worthless shit. This is an encyclopedia, and when we talk about things other than edits, we're fucking wrong. End of story. <p> Go forth and edit. People don't exist. Articles exist. <p> '''That''' is what clarifies the situation for me. I'm not confused, just done with it. Again, her criticisms of me were fully valid and appropriate. Her behavior continues to be ridiculous. Whatever. -
[GTBacchus]: Well, I think we're understanding each other. The parties who continue to think it's fruitful to talk about each other, report each other, etc., etc.... these people have it in their power to just stop. Will they choose that? Experience says no. <p> I've been burned by enough of these situations that I've become quicker to burn out on it. If someone asks me for help and advice, and then doesn't even attempt to do what I suggest, I invest less of myself in that situation than I used to. I got tired of feeling like a chump for people who don't seem to give a shit. Now I beat them to the not-giving-a-shit punch. Is this progress? It's fucking depressing, is what it is. I'm going to log off and play Facebook games now. -
[GTBacchus]: Oh yeah. I drift away all the time. When I'm particularly annoyed, I don't even log in, but I still edit as an IP. :) It's not Wikipedia that bugs me, but the messes GTBacchus gets himself involved it. This particular episode can be viewed as part of a larger story that stretches back to '05, the first time I tried to get feuding Wikipedians to talk to each other. I live, I sometimes wipe out spectacularly, and I slowly learn. I'll still drink to that. -
[GTBacchus]: Hi. You're welcome to remove my name; I'm not actively coaching, nor available to do so in the foreseeable future. Thanks for the note. -
[GTBacchus]: That's done. -
[GTBacchus]: Well, that was a little bit more than 3 years ago. I repaired a cut-and-paste move that someone had done, probably when I was working in [[Wikipedia:requested moves|requested moves]]. See the [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Special:Log&page=Honor+killing page logs]. Are you having any problem editing it? -
[GTBacchus]: Yeah, thanks. I only noticed the previous deletions after I deleted it. Is there something I should be doing, because of this? -
[GTBacchus]: I've replied there in context. I hope that's helpful. -
[GTBacchus]: I don't think of it as a contest. I think that, with the article being expanded, it will simply become clear which title is correct. Otherwise, it's just one of these stagnant disagreements that doesn't help anyone, and results in a long, slow move war. That's what I'm trying to avoid. DIREKTOR, what would you like to see different? -
[GTBacchus]: By the way: It would contribute significantly to good will all around, and take away the \""contest\"" feeling, if Theirrulez were to find and add some sources using the Croatian name, and vice-versa. Surely, Theirrulez, in your searching, you find some sources that don't use your preferred name? -
[GTBacchus]: Wow. What a lot of drama. :) DIREKTOR, if Theirrulez is acting in a way that compromises the English Wikipedia, and if this is only visible by looking at his contributions across many articles, then I hope you will have some time and energy to set up an RFC\/U ([[Wikipedia:Requests for comment\/User conduct]]), because that sounds like something that is important to stop. Telling ''me'' about his behavior won't have much effect. If there is a larger discussion over the actions of the [[User:Theirrulez]] account, then I will certainly be willing to comment on what I have personally observed. <p> Replying now to [[User:AlasdairGreen27]]: Hi. Welcome to my talk page. I'm not sure what you want me to take away from your comments. Suppose Theirrulez is getting help assembling sources... is that bad? Is it bad to collect reliable sources that relate to an article. <p> Is is most emphatically '''not''' the case that \""he who collects more sources wins\"", so I'm not sure what the problem is. As far as I can see, FV is a credit to both his Italian and his Croatian identities, and on my watch, the article will reflect both. What is it you're worried about, exactly? <p> Everyone: This is not some kind of game of \""cloak-and-dagger\"" in which we try to expose secret agents. This is an encyclopedia, and if you feel that some article is biased, there's a remedy open to you: '''edit it'''. I don't understand what all the drama and intrigue is over. Just add sourced facts to the article, and everything else falls into place. <p> '''All of your time spent reporting each other for \""infractions\"" would be better spent improving the article. And other articles. All of it.''' -
[GTBacchus]: DIREKTOR, I don't think it's fictitious, I just think you're addressing the problem in the wrong venue. There are two ''entirely'' separate issues here. (1) What should the article about F.V. be called? (2) What about Theirrulez?. If you wish to address issue #2, there is a whole world of procedures set up for you to do that. I am no part of that world. I'm only available for article editing and titling issues. <p> If there's a problem with Theirrulez, then you need to set up an RFC\/U, and deal with it that way. On the other hand, if the article on F.V. is to stay at a Croatian title, then it needs to be clear that he's more notable in English literature with a Croatian name than with an Italian one. Do you notice how that criterion makes no mention of any editor by name? Yeah. <p> I understand that you're very frustrated by the actions of a set of editors. However, we can't make decisions about articles based on who certain editors may be, or what agendas they may have. Decisions about articles are based on sources. Full stop. If the article should have a Croatian name, then prove it, with sources. Otherwise, it's going to have an Italian name, because it currently appears that F.V. is more notable in the English literature as an Italian engineer than he is as a Croatian lexicographer. <p> Do you understand where I'm coming from here, DIREKTOR? I don't lack sympathy; I just separate one issue from another, and I'm not the person to deal with the other issue. -
[GTBacchus]: I just edit-conflicted with this paragraph, and I have no idea who typed it or what it's about. Give me 5 minutes, and I'll comment. -
[GTBacchus]: You know, Theirrulez, the best response to reversions is to impersonally and impassionately document the edits you wish to make on the talk page, per [[Wikipedia:BRD]]. I wish I were seeing more discussion of edits, and less comments like what you've said right here. Phrases such as \""''...your absurd fancy and your anacronistic pov''\"" have no place in a discussion about edits. Nor does \""''Your shameful attacks are the lower-level I ever see on wikipedia''\"", nor \""''your non-sense, your slurs''\"". <p> You're talking more about DIREKTOR than you are about the edits. How is such rhetoric supposed to be helpful? It cannot be helpful. It may feel very satisfying, but why not edit in the way our policies encourage you to? Why not? If you would both rather talk about each other than about the article, then you should start a blog, and do it there. Wikipedia is not here to host fights, but rather to be an encyclopedia. Please, you know editing is supposed to work. Why not lead by example? -
[GTBacchus]: Thank you, Salvio. I hope you haven't spoken too soon. I don't know if the discussion on that talk page can be pulled away from the personal and towards the professional. How does one convince people to stop talking about each other and start talking about edits, in a neutral and academic manner? I don't know. :( <p> Nevertheless, I appreciate the vote of confidence. -
[GTBacchus]: I'm not sure how it's going to be useful to me. I mean, addressing editor conduct is best done in a different venue, such as [[Wikipedia:RFC\/U]], which I would encourage you to do <p>. I'm trying, in this situation, to focus on article improvement, and to shift the focus ''away'' from user conduct, because they're two issues that must be separated in order for good work to be done. It's difficult. What would be really helpful would be some focused discussion of edits on the talk page. I'm not sure how to elicit that. Any ideas? -
[GTBacchus]: I don't see how an open RM can \""cause\"" edit-warring. The solution to edit-warring is easy: don't do it. My concern with simply closing the move request is that people won't take a more constructive attitude - they'll just go away. Arguing is easier than improving articles, and apparently more satisfying on some level. <p> If you disagree with a round of edits, why not break the dispute down into small, bite-sized pieces, and start a talk page section to discuss them neutrally and impersonally? How is an open RM preventing you - or anyone else - from doing that? -
[GTBacchus]: Thank you. I hope so, too. It can be difficult to jump-start the editing process once it's become bogged down in personal disputes. Any success that I might have is due in large part to the myriad mistakes I've made trying to do this sort of thing in the past. The trick, as with so many things, is to keep getting back up. :) -
[GTBacchus]: It's entirely in your hands whether any good can come of it. All you have to do is rise to the occasion. Whether or not it's \""ok\"" to motivate people by holding an RM open, it's something to try, and you are certainly in a position to guarantee that it doesn't work, if that's what you want to do. You also have the power to make it work. If I close the RM today, the article will be titled \""Fausto Veranzio\"". Is that really what you're trying to ask for? It's in your hands to make this productive. You have the power. What's your choice? Is it to argue with me about procedure, rather than improving the article? That's what you're doing now. <p> Direct this energy towards the article, and things will magically start getting a lot better. I'm a tenacious arguer, and this can drag out for weeks. Is that your goal? <p> Why aren't you posting ''about specific edits'' on the talk page? Why not oppose the edits you don't like in the constructive way, rather than by reverting? Does that really just not interest you at all? Don't you want to see the article improve? What are you doing to make that happen? -
[GTBacchus]: Yeah... stepping in between fighting parties is a good way to get hit, a lot. This is why I don't do it every week. :) <p> Thanks for the heads-up; I'll watch that page. -
[GTBacchus]: I think we're largely on the same page. Both of us are frustrated by situations in which productive but blunt editors are hounded by people who take offense at direct and blunt communication. These situations could be avoided if (a) the blunt editors were a little more willing to adjust their tone, or if (b) those bothered by their tone got over it. Perhaps you lean more on (b) and I lean more on (a)... I don't really know. Either way, we're both fighting the good fight. I wish you well, and look forward to our crossing paths again, perhaps over on the article-editing side of things. :) -
[GTBacchus]: If I knew of a good way to implement arse-kicking and hat-straightening in today's Wikipedia... Well, I don't know of one. I hope you know that I appreciate your contributions, and regret that your time is wasted over such matters. Take care. -
[GTBacchus]: I'm going to have to look at this tomorrow. It's getting late where I am, and I'm close to sleeping. Next time I log on, I'll follow those links, and see if there's anything I can perhaps say, that might be helpful. Meanwhile, have a good night. :) -
[GTBacchus]: I've posted notes, both to Trocksuk4415 and to Aspects. I hope that what I said is somehow helpful, and I'll keep an eye on the situation. Like I said to Aspects, I'd be willing to issue a short block if I see someone else makes Aspects' edit, and if Trocksuk4415 reverts them as well. It's just a lot cleaner when there are more than just the two editors going back-and-forth (although Aspects is pretty clearly the one editing in compliance with the way we try to do things here). I hope the situation works out quickly. -
[GTBacchus]: Check it out: [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment\/Malleus Fatuorum]]. It's red. ArbCom likes to see one of those before they'll look at a case. -
[GTBacchus]: I was a little surprised. Actually, someone started one last fall, but there wasn't a second endorser within 48 hours, and the person filing it withdrew the request, so it was deleted. It's an interesting read... the lesson seems to be, if you're going to do it, do it right. -
[GTBacchus]: If you bother to familiarize yourself in the very least with my record, you'll find that I wade regularly into conflicts that most other admins shun like the plague. You clearly don't know ''anything'' about me, except that I opined that my blocking Malleus Fatuorum would be pointless at this juncture. If you're going to accuse me of avoiding conflict, do a ''tiny'' bit of homework first. Shit, just look at this talk page, and tell me I'm an avoider of conflict. What a laugh. <p> If you want to know how I think someone could ''responsibly and effectively'' address Malleus' behavior, then you're welcome to ask that question. What you posted here so far though is just nonsense. <p> You think I'm counseling people not to bother with preventative measures! Reread my posts at WQA, and come back when you have some idea of what I actually said. The only measures I counsel people not to bother with are the ones that '''empirically fail over and over again'''. I suppose you think I should bash my head into a wall to get through, when I know damn well where the door is. How absurd. -
[GTBacchus]: I would prefer that you gentlemen use my talk page to communicate directly with me. If you simply wish to chat about potential past lives, you've each got your own talk page. I will cheerfully and '''honestly''' answer any direct questions about my actions at WQA, or my actions anywhere else on Wikipedia. <p> Your conspiracy theories are as childish as how you handle frivolous talk page warnings, Malleus. The way you handled the last stupid and clueless talk page warning, from whatsisname, led to a fucking volcano, and you say that \""rational people act in ways that are likely to lead to desired results\"". What a joke. -
[GTBacchus]: Dr.K., I am interested in what you were saying. I'm not interested in playing guessing games though. What's the \""you fill in the rest\"" part? I'm honestly interested to know, because I care about the effects of my actions. -
[GTBacchus]: I generally am quite okay with relaxed exchanges on my talk page, but I'm not not interested in what I consider juvenile nonsense from Malleus. I ''am'' interested in what you have to say, and I apologize if I was overly dismissive. You were standing next to him... sorry. -
[GTBacchus]: Make it happen, then. Money where mouth is. -
[GTBacchus]: I see. You're empty and full of wind. Money where mouth is. You can't do it, and you know it. You were dead wrong about whatshisname (Remember when you thought he'd fuck off, and he didn't? That was funny.), and now you're just full of wind. Please go away until you're ready to have me desysopped. Full of [[wind]]. -
[GTBacchus]: Thank ''you'' Dr.K. <p> Those are some very interesting observations, which I hadn't thought about. It's funny, because I don't necessarily see myself as being in a position of power. I almost never block anyone - I think I've blocked an established user one time. I only delete pages as part of the housekeeping of carrying out move requests, I don't protect pages, I don't frequent ANI... you get the idea. However, the old concept of adminship being \""not a big deal\"" is false. It clearly is a big deal, to a lot of people, and I could do well to be more conscious of that. <p> I also try to keep the [[Wikipedia:ignore all rules|ignore all rules]] policy close to my heart and mind when I'm on the wiki. I'm very comfortable with uncertainty, even with free-fall. (In some other context and some other time, ask me about the time I moved to Kenya without a plan!) I probably expect, more than it's reasonable to expect, that others will be on-board with such an un-nailed-down attitude. <p> You make a good point. People see admins as authorities, and they desire - and expect - certainty and stability from such figures. <p> I think Malleus was very upset by the whole episode. I don't think he'd admit to any vulnerability, but he clearly cares what people say about him. I hope that his upset-ness translates into some degree of caution in his future actions here. That's probably not very likely, but I'm an incurable optimist. He's a long way from any serious sanctions, and I don't think that today's WQA happenings will be the impetus to start an actual lynch mob. If there's an RFC, it's got a 70% chance of being improperly put together, and therefore being deleted just like his last one, last October. (Yes, I made that statistic up, just now. :) I teach statistics, off-wiki.) <p> Thanks again for your considered and pertinent comments. I'll continue to think about what you said. Cheers. -
[GTBacchus]: At least I hardly ever use the tools except for housecleaning. I feel honored that you consider me a fool. Come back when you're ready to put your money where your mouth is, cowardly child. Nothing but wind..... -
[GTBacchus]: I've never said you can't call someone anything. You can do whatever you want. It might be very stupid, but you can still do it. I won't block you. If you're not a coward, put your money where your mouth is, and get me desysopped. Do it, child. <p> Oh, and point to anything dishonest I've said, child. -
[GTBacchus]: I know, right? If it were anyone else, it would be horrible, but I think this is how you bond with the guy! Kisses, Malleus - mwaaah! I don't kiss ''men'' y'see. -
[GTBacchus]: I've seen many desysopped. You want a list? -
[GTBacchus]: You really did make it yourself! Thank you, John. I will strive to be worthy of it. -
[GTBacchus]: Please stop posting here already. You're the idiot who utterly '''failed''' to predict what would happen after you told the guy to fuck off, because you're ignorant. You failed, and you can't goddamned stand it. Now leave me alone. -
[GTBacchus]: Ok, I can see that I've been less than clear about all this. For a difficult and well-established user, it's very difficult to do anything, but it's not impossible. Simply throwing a block at someone like Malleus for incivility is not a good idea. Taking him to WQA is not a good idea. Arguing with him as I did yesterday, while satisfying on a certain level, is not a good idea. Filing a hasty RFC that gets deleted after a few days (as happened last October) is not a good idea. <p> Here are ideas that could possibly have some effect: (1) Lead by example. By this I mean, in context, where there is tendentious editing going on, use effective communication and dispute resolution skills where he will see the effects. If he's going to change his style, it will be a result of seeing someone get some real work done in a style that is a little bit more collegial than his own. If that happens enough times, then he would probably move slightly in that direction. This is a long, slow, incremental process, which makes it not very satisfying, and also carries the risk that for every inch of progress, there's a foot of back-sliding. Still, this is probably the ''best'' option, on some level. <p> If option (1) seems not to be working, there's the dispute resolution avenue. It would start with option (2) A properly filed RFC. As I said on this page, talking about last fall's failed RFC, if you're going to do it, do it right. That means the following: (a) Choose the right context. (b) Approach it as a tool of assistance and not as a weapon. (c) Be prepared to run lots of damage control. (d) Be prepared for the possibility that it'll take 2 or three iterations to have any effect. I could say more to unpack what each of those means, and if you want me to, just ask. <p> Finally, I was in a rotten, combative mood yesterday when you posted to my page, asking questions such as \""Then what did you become an admin for? To shirk responsibility? To avoid conflict? To shy away?\"", which I find to be goading and sarcastic. That's why I replied irritably, which I realize was not helpful. I'm sorry about that. It is better in such a situation if I just go away from the wiki for a while and come back when I'm prepared to suck up the apparent sarcasm and answer with a better tone. <p> I hope that I've now said something that addresses your valid concerns; if I can say more, please let me know. Also, I thank you for bringing these concerns to me attention, and I truly will think about what you've said. -
[GTBacchus]: I couldn't possibly pass an RFA today anyhow. The expectations placed on admin candidates are very different now than they were in 2005. That isn't quite what you asked though. What you see here is what happens one of the four or so times that I got angry on Wikipedia. It turns out that I can be pushed to the point that I hit back. I don't like it. I'm not proud of it. I'm also still angry with Malleus, and I'm not going to talk to him anymore, today or this week. <p> I would hope - and this is probably too much to ask - that anyone wanting to form a picture of my character would take a broader view than one snapshot of me when I was really ticked off. I hope they would look at the responses I'm posting this morning, for example, and see how I go about picking up the pieces the next day after I've experienced a regrettable human failing in public view. <p> That said, I have been for a long time an administrator open to recall if the community judges me unfit for the tools. If that happens, I won't fight. I hope I've answered your question. -
[GTBacchus]: I thank you John, and Dr.K. for your conciliatory words here. Malleus is right that I am susceptible to hypocrisy, in particular when I'm angry. I think that's a fairly normal human trait, which I imagine we all share to some degree. The best solution in an environment such as this is to log off when angry, and come back later. I didn't do that; instead I descended to mud-throwing, and look at me now: covered with mud. <p> The best thing I can do now is to walk away from the situation, and continue with my usual activities, which don't involve locking horns with Mr. Fatuorum. You've all seen my worst side now, and I can't do anything about that. Therefore, I'll suck it up, try to learn from it, and otherwise put it behind me. Thanks again to everyone who has endeavored to pour oil on this water. <p> I hope that not everyone shares MF's estimation that my behavior when I'm extremely angry is somehow my \""true colors\"". I tend to think that my true colors comprise ''all'' of my different moods and attitudes. Some of those colors are pretty, some are ugly. On balance, I think that I do alright. If not, I am as I said above, an admin open to recall, and I would not oppose the will of the community if I'm asked to return the mop. -
[GTBacchus]: I'd like to clarify two further points. First, regarding my use of admin powers. I don't see myself as a \""cop\"", nor do I consider myself to be charged - as an admin - with \""regulating the community's general attitude\"". I think that, when admins try to play cop, it goes badly almost all the time. A far better way to regulate general attitude is available to any editor, namely: Lead by example. <p> I do engage in dispute resolution work, and I don't use my buttons when I'm doing that. I engage as an informal mediator, who can talk to disagreeing parties and help find a way through the dispute. If they're more inclined to listen to me because I'm an admin... I think that's a little bit silly, because I'm really just an editor with some extra buttons. I try to lead by example, rather than compelling by force. Yesterday's WQA meltdown turned out to be a poor example of that, and I'm doing my best to learn from the experience. <p> I do use the buttons. I delete pages quite regularly, as part of the housekeeping work of carrying out page-moves. You can see my deletion log [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Special:Log\/delete&user=GTBacchus here]. (That's a total somewhere between 4000 and 5000 deletions.) I seldom complete speedy deletion requests, or close AFDs. That's just not where I've happened to specialize, but I do it on occasion. <p> I also use the block button. You can see my block log [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Special:Log\/block&user=GTBacchus here]. (That's, as of this post, 191 blocks.) I don't block established users - I think that usually does more harm than good - but I block common vandals, which are either brand new accounts or unregistered editors. I don't do it often, because in the work that I specialize in (page moves, stub sorting, and informal mediation), it doesn't generally come up. <p> Like I said, I just wanted to clarify that I'm not someone who \""self-admittedly, does not use their administrative powers\"". I just don't use them in ways that I believe to be counter-productive. I use the mop as a [[mop]], and not as a [[billy-club]]. <p> Second point: \""Demands that you can't back up are hollow\"". Using the phrase \""I demand\"" comes of silly-sounding when you're not in a position to enforce your demand. It's not a demand at that point, it's a strong request. Terrorists who have hostages to release - they can make demands. Nations with armies to back up their words can make demands. People who aren't in a position to do anything sound silly, as if they're saying \""do what I demand, or else I'll.... be upset!\"" <p> Better than making \""demands\"" that just come of sounding petulant, is asking what effective recourse is available, and I've been prepared to answer that question the whole time. I think I answered it in my post previous to this one. -
[GTBacchus]: In case it doesn't go without saying, I do join John in agreeing to stay away from M.F.'s talk page. I don't think any good can come from my posting there, now or possibly ever. M.F. belongs to the small class of editors who can actually get my goat, and I'm better off giving him a wide berth. -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks for the note. I just get frustrated sometimes. I'm not giving up on the article - I still want to add more from the source I obtained via the library - but I'm done arguing with DIREKTOR over how we've done the move request. I'm not sure when I'll be able to look there, but it will be soon. -
[GTBacchus]: I think it's time to block his account, just until he engages in discussion. When he's blocked, he'll have to use his talk page. -
[GTBacchus]: Cheers! Thanks for the shout out. I've been inactive for a little while, so I was a little concerned that Wikipedia's changed, but we seem to be just as ship-shape as ever. See you around. :) -
[GTBacchus]: You're right, there were three supporting. I've made an edit that reflects that. Ultimately, it's not the numbers that matter, but the reasons given. -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks for the heads-up. -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks for the heads-up, I'll reply to you there. By the way, that's a neat thingy - that secure link. Where can I learn more about that? -
[GTBacchus]: Yeah... did you get my (partial) reply? -
[GTBacchus]: Hi. I believe I've fixed everything, so the history of the article is located at the same title as the article itself. If you notice anything I missed, please let me know. Cheers. -
[GTBacchus]: Turning a blue link into a red one is completely acceptable. Don't listen to anyone who tells you that it isn't. -
[GTBacchus]: What I'm saying is that red links aren't bad. An example: Suppose there's a genus of butterflies called ''Paris''. (I don't think there really is.) If someone links that, it'll be a blue link pointing to the city. Someone else notices that the link is wrong, and changes the link from \""<nowiki>[[Paris]]<\/nowiki>\"" to \""<nowiki>[[Paris (genus)]]<\/nowiki>\"". If there's not an article about the genus, then the link will appear as red. This is perfectly fine. <p> The person creating the red link is not obligated to first (or ever) create the article. Red links are part of how Wikipedia grows. <p> Does that help? -
[GTBacchus]: Yeah, that's fair. It was a bit rude the way I said that. I apologize. <p> I guess I feel very strongly that new (or non-logged-in) users shouldn't be told about \""rules\"" that aren't really rules. I'm a big fan of [[WP:IAR]] and [[WP:WIARM]]. I don't want people to feel constrained from contributing. Sometimes those strong feelings result in my being less courteous, and that's inappropriate. <p> The bit about our words not always conveying what we intend is pretty universally applicable, I'm pretty sure. Thanks for giving me a chance to explain myself rather than jumping to any conclusion. -
[GTBacchus]: :D Being a super genius is kind of overrated anyway. -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks for the heads-up, both of you. I've commented there. -
[GTBacchus]: Yeah, I can help with that, though I'm not likely to do them all in one sitting... :) -
[GTBacchus]: Yeah, for some reason, I like doing these manually. I can do them pretty quickly, the count is about 225 last I checked. <p> Also needing to be done: I noticed there's a page [[Transatlantic (disambiguation)]], which is largely redundant with the current content at [[Transatlantic]]. Somehow that situation should be reconciled, but I can think of about 4 ways to do it, none of which is quite optimal. Hmm. -
[GTBacchus]: Glad you got that sorted out... -
[GTBacchus]: I once made a list.... [[User:GTBacchus\/RM closings]], of the first few hundred RM discussions that I personally closed. It's a big set of raw data, but it's not particularly well-organized, and it gets more out-of-date every day. <p> For the last while (few years?), the RM page has been maintained by a bot, so there might be an easy way to document move requests by general type and by outcome. Even if this couldn't be done retro-actively, it might be a cool thing to implement for the future. I suppose that [[Wikipedia talk:Requested moves]] would be a better place to have this conversation? -
[GTBacchus]: Thank you! If you're in one of the few time zones where it's still Christmas, then Merry Christmas to you, too. Else, uh... happy [[Boxing Day]]! :) -
[GTBacchus]: Sure, I mean, I guess you already have contacted me. You're welcome to send me an email; just use the link on the left side of the screen. I'm interested to see which article you're talking about. -
[GTBacchus]: By the way, you don't need \""registered user rights\"" to contribute to most articles. Have you tried editing it yourself? -
[GTBacchus]: You're welcome, and happy days to you, too. :) -
[GTBacchus]: Yes, I suppose I did. How about I finish tidying up redirects, and then I'll see you there? -
[GTBacchus]: Oh, that was straightforward. I've fixed it now. -
[GTBacchus]: Thank you so much! :) I wish you all the things you wish for yourself in the coming year, and look forward to seeing you around. Cheers. -
[GTBacchus]: I'm sorry, I misread the discussion. I'll put it back. -
[GTBacchus]: My point is precisely what I said. I'm not sure I understand your question. I'm not saying whether someone should or should not start an RFC\/U; just pointing out that anything short of it is fatuous. -
[GTBacchus]: There are many things I'd like better than to see you gone. I'd like to see you contributing to Wikipedia in your usual high-quality manner, and I'd like to see you involved in less heat and static. I'd like to see you not show up in WQA threads that are easily avoidable. I certainly recall seeing you choose to say or do things that would obviously and inevitably lead to heat and static, and then when shit happened, you played dumb about it. You're not na\xefve, and you can't fool me into thinking that you are. (No, I'm not talking about the current instance, at all.) <p> So, yeah, I'd like to see less of that kind of nonsense. I'd like to see your good work continue, and your unnecessarily provocative bullshit end. That's a pretty reasonable desire, isn't it? -
[GTBacchus]: We agreed on something just about an hour ago - in your own words - and I suspect you and I would agree about most editing matters. The only points where we disagree involve how to treat other people, and the usefulness of stirring up shit. You seem to think that you can yell at people and have some positive effect in the world by doing it, and I know that to be false. You once tried to \""set my hat on straight\"" by talking to me like I was dirt. That was neither smart, nor useful, nor effective. I mean, unless you think that venting your feelings is a valid use of Wikipedia's servers. It's not. <p> That's all, though. We probably agree about most other things. <p> I'll never open an RFC\/U on you or anyone else, and I have no desire to do so. If you think otherwise, it's because you foolishly believe you know things that you just don't know. You're dishonest, and emotionally a child. Now leave my talk page. -
[GTBacchus]: Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble. -
[GTBacchus]: I've never been blocked before; so this is what it's like. Good work, Malleus, you've proved my point. Telling someone off is unhelpful, and leads to inevitable drama. That's all I had to say. -
[GTBacchus]: Thank you for the note. I have no plan to request an unblock. I think we've quite neatly shown that Malleus' brand of behavior is extremely unhelpful (and immature and stupid), by showing just where it leads. I couldn't be happier. -
[GTBacchus]: If I'm treated differently from you, it's not because I'm an admin. It's because I haven't got a ''pattern'' of behaving this way, and you do. Remember, \""fuck off, troll\""? By acting the way you act, I stirred up shit and got blocked. Duh! -
[GTBacchus]: My money is precisely where my mouth is, and I notice you continue to engage in the behavior that you decry in others. My point is neatly made, and the mud's on your face. I couldn't be happier. -
[GTBacchus]: Still doing it! Report me for calling you a child, and then repeatedly call me a child! This is awesome! I couldn't have written it better! Are people taking notes? -
[GTBacchus]: John, I appreciate and respect your point. However, I feel that, given his history, asking for people to just make nice and move along is equivalent to asking that Malleus continue to get a free pass for chronic ass-hattery. He abuses more editors per week than I have in 5 years, he mocks anyone who reports him for incivility, and then turns around and reports me because I actually hit a sensitive spot, which he finds in others for sport. That's capital-H Hypocrisy. <p> The only personal attack in there is that I called him dishonest (I got diffs!) and emotionally a child, which I stand by, and he has now in the AN\/I thread called me a child twice, and dishonest once. I don't support a block of him, though. I support someone getting through his skull that he's '''wrong''', chronically. <p> This is not a symmetric situation, this is Malleus taking his seat as the God-King of Trolls. I'm not the easiest to bait, but he did it artfully, and I think you'll see that if you take a broad view of the situation. I'm happy that I realized what was going on when I did (right before I said \""Gobble\""), and I'm happy that his colors are showing now for so many to see. He's been getting a free pass for way too long, and he'll never change as long as people say, \""Now, now, you both have good intentions\"". <p> If you care about the people he drives away from the project, then I don't see how you can hold us up as equal in any way here. Whom have I driven away from Wikipedia, with my chronic incivility? If I only light into an average of 1 person every 18 months, then it might really be about ''that person'', and not about my \""anger issues\"". Am I making sense here? -
[GTBacchus]: I'm an admin open to recall. All you have to do is get a handful of editors in good standing who agree that I should relinquish the mop, and I will. I am totally at service to the desires of this community. Desysop me, if you mean what you say. Else, it's wind. -
[GTBacchus]: You're not even being accurate, man! That's not when you withdrew. You withdrew after the scene where you ran to AN\/I to ask whether it was ok for me to maybe edit Dramatica, and then I made it abundantly clear that you had fucked up. You withdrew, quite appropriately, in shame after that. [https:\/\/secure.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:GTBacchus&diff=prev&oldid=300462547] July is later than April. Convenient memory of yours. -
[GTBacchus]: Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble. -
[GTBacchus]: ...a few things? Not being arsed to spell my name correctly is a bit of a puzzle in a post that asks us to treat each other with respect. If nothing else, use copy\/paste. What he doesn't know is that 99% of my contributions here are devoted to singing precisely the song that he's singing now. Only in the case of the very worst and most malicious editors (Malleus and Bugs, for example), do I even come close to flying off the handle. <p> I've had four incidents in 5 years, compared to Malleus' record of shitting on more people than that every single week. He drives people away from the project, and I get people thanking me for teaching them to be less combative and more collegial. My record is easy to review, '''and''' I'm open to recall. RFC\/U me, if you think I've got anger issues. I've got issues with the way our community tolerates chronically malicious and trolling presences such as Malleus and Bugs. <p> Retro's mind-reading is also off. He says that I gobbled \""''totally ignorant of the fact that he probably insulted Malleus''\"". How insulting can you be? I knew damn well that I'd insulted him, quite intentionally, thus '''giving him the response to baiting that he sought'''. In the moment that I did it, I let him troll me unintentionally. Just as soon as I did it though, I realized that I had let him troll me, and that it was going to play out in a way that I find just skippy. I was about to watch him become a fully completed hypocrite, and the best thing I could say was \""Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble.\"" It really is the best response to some kinds of energy, at least according to [[Principia Discordia|certain scripture]]. -
[GTBacchus]: No, because I haven't sacrificed anything. -
[GTBacchus]: You just said earlier today that you never demand apologies. Another lie. Please take me to ArbCom; I can't wait. Don't bother with the seven days; you'll get nothing from me. -
[GTBacchus]: Thank you for your input. [https:\/\/secure.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/wiki\/Special:Contributions\/Wahoh Go edit an article]. -
[GTBacchus]: I just said, \""you get nothing\"". ''I'' don't lie; that's your game. If I said you get nothing, then you get nothing. Your hypocrisy increases with each post. Do it, already. -
[GTBacchus]: You're still unwilling to put your money where your mouth is. Do something about it, or you've proven that you're nothing but a windbag. Your threats are empty, Malleus. Empty. How's that feel? BTW, pointing out bald-faced lies that I can easily link to is not incivility. Making them might be, but I don't report people for incivility. -
[GTBacchus]: I mean... do you seriously think you can intimidate me? Wow, man. Just wow. -
[GTBacchus]: \""''Has the block taught you nothing''\""? You must be kidding. What did you just say earlier today about the effects of blocks on yourself? Do you even remember? And now you try to get all school-marm on ''me''? That's just stupefying. -
[GTBacchus]: I'm sorry, but getting the community to take a closer look at Malleus' behavior is not a wrong-doing. I am quite happy with how this is going. You don't know the context sufficiently well to make apt remarks. I appreciate and respect the spirit in which you're offering conciliatory words, but you don't realize just how much shit we put up with from MF. Many people do realize it, and that's why I'm welcoming scrutiny. If I just apologize and sweep it under a rug, then I'm doing the community a disservice. Malleus is an actual problem, and we've been ignoring it for too long. -
[GTBacchus]: I appreciate that. I've just posted a couple of replies there, and I'd like nothing more now than to head back to my usual haunt at [[WP:Requested moves]], where the only drama I have to deal with is centuries-old ethnic disputes and strongly-held feelings about the English language. A nice break from... this. <p> I do hope this leads to some scrutiny of MF's behavior, but I'm not terribly optimistic about that. -
[GTBacchus]: It really doesn't help to use words like \""sinful\"" when talking with people who might not share those notions. We don't go to the same church, okay? I appreciate what you're doing, but that's a good way to push people's buttons. <p> To reply to your comments... You ''really'' aren't familiar with my record. If you think that what you're telling me is anything different from what I say every single day, then you're wrong. I'm a step ahead of you. I was rude to Malleus, and that was an error. That's easy for me to grant, but I'm not going to apologize to him, nor to do anything that simply encourages this being swept under the rug. I believe that Malleus is consistently driving people away from this project. A delay in looking at his editing is not helpful. If he files some kind of case against me, that's the ''fastest'' way to get this problem aired before the Arbitrators. Therefore, I'm all for it. <p> I don't want to make nice, and to pour oil on this water. I want Malleus to understand that he's not as completely above-the-rules as he claims to be. I don't claim to be above the rules; he does. He just did it on AN\/I. How many times should we sweep this under the rug? <p> When it comes to responding to an RFC\/U or an ArbCom case, I am actually very, very, very good at being calm and just giving the facts. You are not familiar with my record. I care about this project very much, and I'm tired of seeing it shit on by a troll as insidious as Malleus Fatuorum. He is doing the project very great harm, and that's why I describe him as one of the worst and most malicious editors. He doesn't get banned in a week; he keeps damaging the project for years. How long shall we turn a blind eye to this? -
[GTBacchus]: Yes, I'm for that. Why are you still delaying? Empty threat, right? -
[GTBacchus]: I don't need time to think, as I already said. It wasn't a lie. Some of us don't lie the way you do. (\""I never demand apologies.\"") You get nothing from me. Now file a fucking case, already, or you're completely full of wind. I'm calling your bluff; how many times are you going to make me call it? I'm set, and I won't change my mind. -
[GTBacchus]: Why are you still talking to me? Do it already! -
[GTBacchus]: I've told you my position, and I wasn't lying. Nothing will change, except that it becomes clearer with each comment here that you're bluffing, i.e., lying again. '''I'm calling your bluff. There is nothing further to talk about.''' -
[GTBacchus]: He won't do it. See which of us is afraid of scrutiny. I've been an admin open to recall since the idea of administrative recall was first mooted. <p> I ''would'' appreciate Malleus leaving my talk page alone, as I'm trying to get back to work on the encyclopedia, and the constant orange banners are annoying. If there's actual new information, then by all means bug me, but this? Please. -
[GTBacchus]: (ec)You're repeating yourself, Malleus. Cut it out. We know where we're at: You're scared to do what you said you'd do. It bores me. -
[GTBacchus]: There's some stuff to think about here. One easy point: \""''when you '''offer''' to provide diffs upon request of his dishonesty and then '''refuse''' to provide them it doesn't look good.''\"" I didn't refuse to provide diffs of his dishonesty. He never asked for those. He asked for diffs documenting that he's driven people away. Those instances, don't tend to have clear diffs, unlike his dishonesty, which is easy to document. He lied 3 or 4 times during the affair yesterday, and I pointed those instances out, quite clearly. I am still completely willing to provide further documentation of Malleus' dishonesty, and he still hasn't asked for such, nor responded to what I have already provided. He wants documentation of those he's driven away, and I'm holding out on that until he fulfills his promise. <p> Your points about anger are well-made, and I'll take some more time to respond to that. If anyone wants further evidence of Mal's easy-to-document dishonesty, they need only ask. -
[GTBacchus]: Finally! :D Give me  few minutes to read this post below, and I will trot out a list of your words and behaviors that I perceive as dishonest. I pointed out some blow-by-blow yesterday, but I'll recap. -
[GTBacchus]: I would broadly agree with everything you've said here. As for disengaging, I'm disengaged with Malleus, except for answering his request for documentation above. The ball is in his court, and he'll either file the case he said he would, or he won't. If he files a case, I'll respond, if not... oh well. The only thing that an RFC\/U will accomplish is to document problems for a future ArbCom case. That's all that RFC\/U's are good for, mostly. I've never been party to Malleus receiving unfair blocks, and if he wants to take them out on me.... oh well. I truly hope that he brings an RFC against me. I want the vindication. <p> One other thing, and you're welcome to test me on this. If someone says I lied, or calls me dishonest, my '''very first''' reaction will be to ask for documentation. That's '''before''' I fly off the handle. If it turns out I spoke an untruth, they'll have an apology before they have time to ask for one. I take honestly '''extremely''' seriously. If I'm going to stop being honest, then I hope also to stop breathing in that moment. If someone claims to have caught me being dishonest, my thoughts are about identifying and fixing that problem, not about hitting that person. I'm not playing around here. -
[GTBacchus]: Ok. Yesterday's examples are fairly trivial, but their bald-faced nature makes them stick out in my mind. <p> (1) Just a couple of hours after saying at WQA, \""I have to agree with GTBacchus\"", you said that you doubt we'll ever agree on anything. That's trivial and silly, but glaring and telling to my mind. Someone who tells trivial lies will also tell big ones. Saying you doubt we'll agree on anything is also an absurd and grandiose claim, when it's trivially obvious that we agree about very, very many things. We both abhor abusive admins, for example, except that you won't believe me despite my clear record of calling them out, and watching them get desysopped for precisely the behavior I called them out for. What do you care about facts, when you've already decided you know what I am? <p> (2) Just a couple of hours after saying: \""I've never demanded an apology from anyone on wikipedia, and I don't expect to start now,\"" you demanded an apology from me. Is it true that you've ''never'' done this before? Perhaps. Maybe this was an entirely new behavior out of Malleus Fatuorum. It reeks to me of dishonest posturing followed by hypocrisy. Technically, you \""don't expect to start now\"" leaves open the possibility that you might, which would make it less of an honesty issue and more of a self-knowledge one. Who knew that you were about to open a new door, reporting others for \""civility violations\"" and demanding apologies? Next thing you know, you'll have a \""civility police\"" badge, and you'll wear it proud. I guess you'll never say again that you've never demanded an apology, because now you've done it. Remember that. <p> (3) Now we get to substantial stuff. Given your attitude about \""civility police\"" there's something fundamentally dishonest about reporting someone for a civility \""violation\"", but let's not linger over that. I got under your skin, and you reacted as such; this is normal. Lots of us (including myself) engage in behavior that we normally decry, when we're pushed to a certain point. That doesn't make us phonies so much as fallible humans, and if we can start from the premise that we both make mistakes in our interactions, then we'll get along just fine. I've never seen a glimmer of that kind of humility from you. Does it exist? I dunno. <p> Here's what I'm really thinking about, and it happened a little while ago, leaving a big impression in my mind. There was a WQA complaint about you, and I saw the thread and commented. Someone had posted a civility warning to your talk page for telling another editor that he should grow up. Your response to the warning was \""fuck off, troll\"", and his response was to go to WQA. I told him that leaving you civility warnings was pointless at best, which I think we would agree about. (There it is again! We agree!) Then you and I had a ''very'' interesting conversation. <p> You said that a reasonable person performs whatever actions are most likely to lead to their preferred result. We agree about that. :) I pointed out that you had essentially requested the WQA report, because you performed an action that was most likely to lead there: namely, telling someone to fuck off and calling them a troll, when they've already exhibited an officious and lawyerly approach to civility. This is a no-brainer. Tell a civility-cop to \""fuck off\"", and you've just asked for \""escalation, please\"". You said that my logic was wrong at the following point: that you really expected he would just fuck off. I responded that you couldn't possibly be that na\xefve, and your reply was fascinating. You said that you'd heard enough of my \""psycho-babble\"", and came around to my talk page to yell at me and \""set my hat straight\"" (another dishonest claim, which I'll get to in a moment). <p> Now, what really happened here? You knew damn well that a civility cop won't fuck off if you tell him to fuck off. He'll escalate; this is obvious, and you have more than enough experience to know it. You knew damn well that he would escalate, and you pushed that button, quite intentionally. After pushing the button, you claimed that you didn't know what that button did, and that you actually expected him to just toddle off into the sunset. When I pointed out that you can't be that na\xefve, you became abusive. You didn't argue that, no, you really thought he would leave you alone. You didn't stop and think and say.... \""hmmm, there's a thought. I guess that is pretty predictable.\"" No, you started in with the name-calling. <p> Now, is this a trivial untruth? No. It's not a \""lie\"" in the most literal sense of the word. It is fundamental, deep-down-inside dishonesty. It's intellectual disintegrity. When someone pointed out that you were wrong, you didn't think about acknowledging it; you just went into attack mode. That is the opposite of honesty. An honest man hears criticism, considers it seriously, and either takes it to heart, or says why it doesn't apply. An honest man does not respond to honest criticism by flying off the handle. An honest man owns up to his mistakes. <p> It's pretty clear that you enjoy a fight, that you like telling people off, and that you get a kick out of seeing people get upset over your blunt words. Do you admit to this? No. What do you do? You say that someone needs their hat set on straight, as if you're stupid enough to think that your yelling at someone will somehow improve them as a person. You would have to be a great fool to think this, and you are not a great fool. Thus, dishonesty. You don't yell at people to \""set their hats straight\"", because you know goddamned well that it doesn't have that effect. That's like saying you piss to make the sun rise. You piss because you have to piss, and you take the piss because you want to take the piss. You see, I can't believe that you're stupid; you weren't just born last week. You know how people react to things, and you know that they'll react in ways that you then claim to be surprised by. Therefore, I must believe that you're playing games with us. Playing games, and not owning up to them, is fundamentally dishonest. Honest men ''simply don't do it''. <p> I'm not talking about trivial untruths; I'm talking about fundamental intellectual integrity. <p> So, why did I call you dishonest? Well, partly it was to point out the nonsense in your claims from last time. Partly it was so you would ask me for examples, and as I think of more, I'll add them. Partly - largely - it was because I knew it would piss you off, and I ''am'' honest enough to own my motivations, even when they're as shitty and stupid as they were yesterday. Pissing someone off is a ''terrible'' motivation, anytime, any place. No question: I fucked up. So did you, Malleus, and I wonder when you'll be someone who can admit as much in public. <p> I'm owning up to mistakes here. It was a mistake to tell you that you're dishonest and emotionally a child, and it was a mistake I made because I was upset with your ridiculous writing off of my previous statements. Posting in anger is ''always'' a mistake, and I've done it a few times. I'm now trying to make the most of it. I'm certainly not apologizing for it, despite it being a mistake, because I want you to file that case. I think it will serve the community, which is much more important than either of us. I don't think that's a mistake; we'll see. <p> What have your mistakes been, Malleus? -[[User:GTBacchus|GTBacchus]]<sup>([[User talk:GTBacchus|talk]])<\/sup> 01:05, 4 January 2011 (UTC) <small> <p> PS: I'll add to the list if more instances of dishonesty occur to me or are brought to light. I wonder.... applying my advice here to myself, how are you most likely to respond, and is it what I'm after? Hmmm... I hope you respond by filing an RFC, and I hope you read what I've written carefully enough to consider applying it to yourself. I know little enough about how you function that I honestly can't say whether the latter is likely. I don't think it is, but I don't know what would work better, so I'm using the only reliable tool I've got, which is to break things down into logical pieces, and trace the causes and effects. We'll see... -
[GTBacchus]: You warned him? What effect will that have? Same as other warnings he's received? Malleus may reply here in whatever manner he sees fit, and then we can all see what he means by \""fit\"". I have a hard time seeing \""please don't have a confrontation\"" as anything other than \""let him be as abusive as he wants to be, anytime he wants to do it\"". Nobody has suggested any way of mitigating his behavior other than to let him be. That's been failing for years. -
[GTBacchus]: Between now and then, I don't know how much I'll have time to reply to. When I get back, I'll read everything, and reply in detail as necessary and appropriate. I hope that, if someone is putting together an alluded-to RFC, it happens soon, as I'm quite eager to see what people think. Whatever the result of that, you can be sure I will continue to contribute in my [[WP:RM|usual way]], because I've become quite attached to this crazy place that we call Wikipedia. I wish you '''all''' peace and good health, and I look forward to re-engaging in a few days. -
[GTBacchus]: I'm pretty sure that baiting is a behavior we frown upon. Until we can change human (or fishy) nature so that nobody takes bait, then having people around baiting for sport is a problem. If I ignore it as I have for years, then fish after fish after fish gets shit on. <p> Regarding \""discussing who is the bigger liar\"": If someone has made postings about my honesty, I haven't read them yet. When I do, I'll own up to any failing on my part, because I have no wish to be dishonest or misleading in any way, shape or form. It is my extremely honest opinion that if someone sees fit to use our servers to bait, insult, abuse, mock and poke at others, then they should be stopped. I don't do these things, and the only time I get really upset is when I see someone else getting away with treating their fellow Wikipedians like dirt. <p> I won't look away from active abuse, and I'm sorry if anyone else thinks that looking away is a solution. I'm sorry if anyone thinks that blaming people for not being \""thick skinned\"" enough is a solution. I'm sorry if anyone thinks that we should expect editors here to tolerate contempt and derision as being par for the course. We should be better than that, and I'm very sorry if we're not. -
[GTBacchus]: Now that I've had time to catch up, I see that \""discussing who is the bigger liar\"" is a completely misleading red herring. Nobody has even accused me of dishonesty, so that is sure as hell not what any discussion is about. Malleus asked for documentation of why I called him dishonest, I provided it, and that's that. <p> Looking the other way is no solution, and I'm disappointed. -
[GTBacchus]: I might be significantly calmer and less frustrated than you think. It's getting to be days between posts - how much emotion do you imagine I'm dragging around New Orleans with me? There are bigger and better fish to fry around here than anything on this Wiki, at least for my money. Also, I process things without doing all my thinking aloud on this page. <p> I feel pretty good about the way this situation is currently disposed: Either MF will do what he said he'd do, and that makes me happy, or he won't do what he said he'd do, and that makes me happy. I do feel passionately that Wikipedia suffers when we allow chronically abusive users to get away with it, and I think that MF is chronically abusive, but I don't have to file any action against him. Someone else will do it, and eventually he'll either moderate his behavior, or he'll have to go. It's just life on Wikipedia. Have a beer; it's a beautiful world. :) -
[GTBacchus]: I'm describing a behavior, which is not inappropriate to do. Your behavior is problematic, and it's fine for me to notice that. If you disagree, we can talk about your behavior, but crying \""no NPA\"" in the same breath as telling me to \""engage my brain\"" is not going to get you very far, or make you look very sympathetic. If you feel that someone has been rude to you, then being rude back is not a very good strategy. Try the high road. <p> I've never suggested that your brain is less than engaged; simply that you're doing something disruptive, and doing it regularly. I don't suppose you mean to be disruptive, so it would be good for you to learn better interaction skills. Now, you work on that, and I'll work on doing what I do. <p> Don't worry; I won't file a case against you, and you know that because ''I said I wouldn't''. You were quite clear that you absolutely would file one against me, and I look forward to that. Meanwhile, don't act like a \""civility cop\"", crying \""NPA\"" when someone suggests that your actions may be problematic. I'm describing your actions just as dispassionately as ArbCom will eventually have to describe them. <p> Before you reply, think: What's your goal, and what is most likely to lead there, in this universe? Will berating me get you where you want to be? -
[GTBacchus]: Ok, thanks! :) It's not a threat, but a prediction, because I absolutely won't be the one doing it. I said I wouldn't file any kind of case, so I won't. Someone will; it's inevitable. I hope you do what you said you'd do. Have a nice day, and I'll keep my counsel on how I spend my time. :)  -
[GTBacchus]: Ok, that's done. -
[GTBacchus]: It is a bit messy, isn't it? That's inevitable, but it can be minimized if everyone agrees as to what's actually going on. The whole [[WP:NCPEER]] guideline is clearly in a state of instability, and where it ends up will eventually be determined in these move discussions. People will talk about NCPEER at its own talk page, but that's not really where the decisions are made. <p> Therefore, we'll end up discussing quite a few cases on merits, until we see something consensual emerging from the soup. Whatever that is will be noted at [[WP:NCPEER]], at which point people will immediately start treating it as statutory law, written in stone. So it goes, 'round here. <p> I'm working in moves quite a bit these days, so until that changes, I'll keep making comments and doing what I can to steer the discussion away from the various rocks and into appropriate waters. I think that's the best thing - to stay focused - and for everyone to remember that we're all on the same side, and that we get to decide how Wikipedia will work, based on our mutual good-faith commitment to the project. <p> I hope this is somewhat helpful, and I'll see you on those talk pages. Let me know if you have any more general questions or concerns; you know how to find me. :) -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks for the note. -
[GTBacchus]: It's happened now, although it's beginning to look like we'll be back at [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] before long. -
[GTBacchus]: I agree that would be ideal. Maybe a note at [[WT:RM]] would be helpful, or perhaps a content RFC. It would be nice to find out what the community of editors ''really'' thinks. -
[GTBacchus]: It's not clear how well supported that naming convention is, but it appears that the discussion is going to favor what you're saying, at least for now. -
[GTBacchus]: No worries. I think we both know that we're both working in good faith here. Take care. -
[GTBacchus]: I'm probably not. I just entered the discussion, and I get the impression you've already gone twelve rounds with him. It looks like an uninvolved admin has arrived on the scene though; let's see how that plays out. -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks. I've made an extra paragraph in my closing rationale, which I hope addresses the concerns that you're bringing up. -
[GTBacchus]: Yeah, really. The discussion was a week deep into the backlog, and there was very little input from the community. If a few more people care to weigh in, then the page can be moved without having to go through the whole RM process, and I'd be totally willing to help with that. When I'm closing these things, I've got to make a call one way or the other, and it's pretty much guaranteed that someone will disagree with my decision each time. <p> It doesn't seem to be an urgent matter, so if it gets moved in a week rather than today, no big deal. If it doesn't get moved at all, that's also no big deal. Why not drop by a relevant WikiProject, see what people say there, and then let me know? -
[GTBacchus]: Hey, guys: I don't care who said she said he said what. I don't care what you think of each other's judgment. I'm not believing or disbelieving anything in particular, and whatever issues you may have with each other, I think you should pursue somewhere other than my talk page. I've posted a couple of notes around to get more input on this naming dispute, and no decision will be made based on either of you telling me anything about the other. Let's let it drop, okay? Please. -
[GTBacchus]: Indeed, that makes perfect sense about the accents. When I processed that page, I didn't even really look at what the issue was with the name, because I was just trying to adjust the formatting so that the bot tending the page at [[Wikipedia:Requested moves|Requested moves]] would know where to list it. Of course, there are no grave accents in Spanish, and I'm sure there won't be any problems moving the page when its requisite seven days have elapsed. Thanks for the note. -
[GTBacchus]: It had been inactive for two days, with no sign of emerging consensus. I guess I'll give it some more time. -
[GTBacchus]: I think it's pretty clear that there's no consensus. The admin who closed this one now makes some good points in his closing rationale. Can I ask why this important to you? -
[GTBacchus]: Ok, thanks for your comments. I'm not sure what to say in response. The more you use inflammatory language, the worse your chances are for dispute resolution. The more you use inflammatory language, the less chance that people arriving upon the situation will take you seriously. The same applies to me. When I sound more intemperate, I'm less effective as an editor. <p> I never declared a refusal to read anything. I read your entire comment, and I commented on the part that stuck out the most to me. That kind of thing sticks out to people. <p> If someone calls you a troll, the best response, and the one that will make you look the best, is to rise above it, not to hit back. This is useful knowledge for you; think about it. -
[GTBacchus]: Thank you so much! :D  <p> I don't really know anything about Sphingid moths, but I was able to figure out the sub-families and tribes well enough to sort a lot of stubs. The work was fun, and it's a good reminder to pay more notice to my Lepidopteran neighbors. There might be Sphingids on my front porch even as I type! Maybe I'll do some more in-depth reading. :) <p> Thanks again. -
[GTBacchus]: Oh dear, I'm sorry. I was moving the page, and I got a \""session data lost\"" screen, and I hit \""refresh\"", and I think I ended up making the same move ''twice'', with the second overwriting the first one. It might need a steward to fix it, because the revision history has over 10,000 versions in it. :\/  -
[GTBacchus]: Neelix, that was a brave close. Kudos to you for taking it on. The argument could really go either way, and at the end of the day, either title works just fine. I think \""no consensus\"" was a reasonable call. -
[GTBacchus]: Oh, and ditto all of that for [[C\xf4te d'Ivoire]]. -
[GTBacchus]: Thank you! It's true, I try not to be evil (and sometimes succeed). Thanks for noticing. ;)  -
[GTBacchus]: There was no crystal-ball gazing there. I said the present is much more accepting of diacritics than the past has been. Nothing at all about the future. I certainly don't see how I'm involved in the issue. Am I pro- or anti-diacritic? I've closed plenty of moves in ''both'' directions, you know. I've certainly tried to read consensus on the issue, over the years, but I don't care one way or the other. I just do my best to read consensus accurately; I've observed it grow steadily more supportive of diacritics over 5 years. <p> Since you've questioned this decision, I've posted to [[WP:AN#Request review of my actions]] for review of my actions. I will always defer to the consensus will of the community. <p> In general, Pmanderson, if you have an issue with any action of mine, you're welcome to bring it up at the time. You needn't wait until someone gives me a barnstar to let me know I've screwed up. I'm actually very receptive to constructive criticism. Thanks for bringing this to my attention, anyway. -
[GTBacchus]: Nah, I never remove things on my talk page. It's a record of who said what, and where, until I archive it. I still don't understand your allegation that I'm somehow \""involved\"". If you want to explain that, I'll eagerly listen. I'm willing to try harder, but the more specific you are, the more responsive I can be. -
[GTBacchus]: My \""example is more visible\"" than I am... I am very curious what this means. Specific examples would be awesome. -
[GTBacchus]: Fascinating. Thank you for that link. -
[GTBacchus]: Thank you for commenting. You are articulating a perspective that I have never before heard or considered in article titling questions, and I find it intriguing. We agree that speedy article improvement should be a goal for [[Jimo]]. I'll look into that now, and I'll be thinking about the \""balance\"" you refer to. That's very interesting. -
[GTBacchus]: If you want a partial map of the minefield you're sauntering onto here, just ask. There are some scary pages around here. You'll get used to not having legs though, because it's the good fight you're fighting. No joke. -
[GTBacchus]: My thought is that it makes a lot of sense to deal with this question in a centralized manner, rather than one category at a time. It would seem weird to use \""Old Fooian\"" style for some of these schools, and a different style for others. This is the kind of situation where consistency is a naming principle you can fall back on. <p> Why not find a way to combine all of those discussions into a community RfC on the subject? If you notify all relevant WikiProjects, that should drown out any private canvassing that might also go on. It seems silly to have dozens of conversations spread out over months, and over dozens of categories. I'm be inclined to close all those CfD's, but without prejudice to combining them into one request, and calling it a Request for comment. -
[GTBacchus]: The redirect is still there. I only deleted its talk page. -
[GTBacchus]: Yes, if you like. I don't know how standard it is to put project banners on redirects, but I have no objection to it. -
[GTBacchus]: Are all of these schools in the UK? Perhaps their WikiProject, but Schools makes sense too. Either way, both should be notified. -
[GTBacchus]: What have you got in mind? -
[GTBacchus]: I hope this clarifies matters. No points were ignored, although not everything was copied and pasted to my sandbox. I read it all, and I thought about it all. -
[GTBacchus]: Nothing is \""contrived to favor some predetermined preference\"", because I have no predetermined preference. Therefore it's impossible that I would contrive something for that reason. If you think I'm a biased closer, please say so quite directly, and I'll request review of my close at [[WP:AN]], as I always do when challenged. <p> The point of \""concise\"" is not that we choose the very shortest title available. It's that titles not be overly long. A person's full name is not overly long. Before you go quoting the text of [[WP:AT]] to me about conciseness, remember that I'm in a very privileged position regarding knowledge the original intent of the authors of the Principal Naming Criteria. <p> What you may consider an \""obvious\"" \""problem\"" in my analysis might be your own opinion, you know? That's a dangerous word, because once you say something is \""obvious\"", you're calling anyone who doesn't see it somehow dumb. To me, none of this is \""obvious\"", because there are obviously intelligent people disagreeing about it. -
[GTBacchus]: I've requested review anyway, because this is the second challenge to my close. [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard#Review of controversial move request?]]. I hope you realize that this would have happened no matter how I closed the thing. -
[GTBacchus]: No. I was certainly not thinking of precision, I was thinking of concision. You seem to be giving the weight of law to the words \""titles are expected to be shorter rather than longer\"". Those words are just something we wrote down one day. They were not handed down to Moses, and it's almost entirely certain that they're not the best way of expressing the principles involved. <p> To me, it is extremely \""obvious\"" that our policies should not be read legalistically. It's very \""obvious\"" that a full name is not a problem under \""concision\"". It's \""obvious\"" that I didn't ignore concision, but that I think of it in a less strictly by-the-words way than you do. It's \""obvious\"" that my thinking of it that way is reasonable, and in line with the intent of the policy. <p> Regarding the relative weights of criteria, those vary from situation to situation. In this case, none of the titles was a problem under concision, so concision weighed nothing. Also in this case, \""Mahatma\"" won under recognizability. However, the weight of that criterion is diminished by the fairly high level of recognizability of \""Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi\"", which is very familiar to a large proportion of educated people on this planet. -
[GTBacchus]: I don't \""own\"" it, B2c, I just know what happened. I was there. I know that consensus can change, but it's not clear that it ''has'' changed in this case! One person interpreted concision according to a strict reading of the words. That doesn't mean that consensus favors a strict reading of the words. It could just mean that people are easily led by overly rule-looking language. We certainly know that to be true. <p> It's not at all clear that consensus has changed to demand strict literal readings of rules here, i.e., that the lawyers have won. It has never been consensus to treat our policies as statutory law, because IAR still stands. <p> As far as the review, I ''always'' ask for review when my closings are challenged - no matter what the challenge looks like. It's not an escalation, and it's not a big deal. It's just what I always do. -
[GTBacchus]: No, I don't know of any evidence like that. Maybe I'll think of it or find it later, but I don't know when this has come up before. This experience will provide some evidence of what the community thinks of my reading of the spirit of the policy. So far I know that one editor finds it reasonable, and one disagrees with it. No more have commented yet on that particular point. -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks, by the way, for motivating me to fucking quit working in Requested Moves. I won't, because I'm one stubborn bastard, but that's what I'm getting from this interaction right now. I think you should close about a thousand move requests, deal with all the static that comes up, and then come back and tell me I'm fucking everything up. Spit. <p> Wikipedia is not made of \""rules\"", and it never will be. That is a beautiful thing, and one day, you'll understand this. For now, just think about how your words come across to other people. Nobody here is just a screen name; we're human beings, and we react in predictable ways. Think about it. -
[GTBacchus]: I wouldn't worry about \""breaking rules\"". You're supposed to be [[WP:IAR|ignoring]] those anyway. I'm going to click on your link now and see what's there. -
[GTBacchus]: I see that none of those titles present a problem in terms of concision. I'm not talking about concision in a vacuum, I'm talking about it as it meaningfully applies to article titles here, and the difference in concision between \""Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi\"" and \""Gandhi\"" is not anything we need to be concerned with. Neither name falls afoul of the concision criterion. I look at \""Gandhi\"" and ask, \""is this concise enough?\"", and I answer \""yes\"". I look at \""Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi\"", and I ask, \""is this concise enough?\"", and I answer \""yes\"". The point of the concision criterion is not to distinguish between cases like those; it's to distinguish wordy titles from reasonable ones. A full name is not \""wordy\"" to an extent that we need to be concerned about at all. I didn't say that \""Gandhi\"" is no more concise than the full name, if all we care about is the definition of the word \""concise\"". However, I don't care one bit about the definition of the word \""concise\"" except insofar as it applies to article titles on Wikipedia. In that sense, the criterion does not, to my mind, based on my observations of community decisions, distinguish between those two choices. If you had never seen a \""concision criterion\"" written down, would you look at a person's full name and say, \""oh that's too long\"". The point of the criterion is to avoid things that are too long. <p> The other examples are, of course, each their own thing. \""Madonna Louise Ciccone\"" is considerably less recognizable than \""Madonna\""; same for Liberace. Both names for Bush are fine. None of these options that you've presented falls afoul of the concision criterion, to my mind, based on my observations of community decisions. <p> When we wrote that criterion down, we weren't making a rule; we were making an educated guess about ''de facto'' naming standards that we were trying to abstract from a thousand varied experiences. We, with 100% certainty, got it wrong. Those criteria are guaranteed to be wrong. Neither you nor I nor anyone has ever actually seen a correct set of naming criteria. What I was trying to abstract when I wrote \""concise\"" on that page was not the difference between \""Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi\"" and \""Gandhi\"". It was the difference between wordy titles and titles that just get to the point. The letter of the law is a terrible approximation of reality, and that's why reading policy pages around here is like huffing rat poison: it's a bad idea. If you literally ''ignore'' them, like the policy recommends, and read the community instead, then you'll be much more on the right page. -
[GTBacchus]: Born2cycle, you said, at [[WP:AN]]: \""''We really have to agree on what Natural and Concise mean and how they are to be applied -- and state that clearly at WP:CRITERIA -- or we're never going to get consensus on anything.''\"" That is entirely incorrect. <p> We need to read community decisions, notice consensus where it happens, and then abstract principles from it. We do not reason top-down; we abstract bottom-up. If you're trying to use the letter of the rule to understand what the rule means, then you've got it backwards. The letter of the rule is pretty much ''always wrong''. If you take it as an approximate guess made by a fallible human who was trying imperfectly to express real criteria that we don't yet understand, then you're on the right page. There was not a consensus for the one-word name; if those criteria hadn't been written down yet, would people be arguing that a person's full name is somehow too long? Since I've never seen people making those arguments, I say that's not a ''de facto'' standard. The only reason someone would make that argument is if they read the criteria and then tried to apply them literally. It's a bad idea; you really shouldn't read policy pages at all, until you're ready to start correcting them based on your knowledge of ''de facto'' community standards. Then you'll realize just how thin and insubstantial those pages are. -
[GTBacchus]: Oh, I didn't notice this while posting below. I agree that the criterion could use re-wording. Now we're playing the right game. Use your knowledge of community standards to correct what the rules say, and then try not to believe too strongly in what you just wrote down. -
[GTBacchus]: Hi, Nedim. I'm sorry to have left you out of that decision; it was not my intention. I didn't read the whole talk page, and I was making that move in the context of a few moves of articles to \""Outline\"" titles. Since they were a consistent set of requests, I closed them all the same way. If I'd known about the earlier discussion, I would have allowed more time and notified a WikiProject or two to generate more input. <p> Is this something you'd like to pursue, or are you satisfied with the current article title? -
[GTBacchus]: Ah. It looks like I got there too late, and someone else closed it. I was visiting a friend who was in town from South Korea for the last day-and-a-half. I only get to see him every couple of years, and I've been offline accordingly. Many move requests come and go, though; I'll be checking on the backlog before long, and we'll have plenty of examples to look at. -
[GTBacchus]: Born2cycle, hi. I want to apologize for getting irritable with you over the whole Gandhi thing. Sometimes I get frustrated working here, for good or bad reasons, and sometimes when I'm frustrated, I keep typing instead of walking away. Please understand that I appreciate your interest and energy that you're putting towards our titling policy, which is something I've come to care about, for better or for worse. <p> I recognize that you and I, and 99% of editors here, are on the same team, and I sure as heck couldn't do it alone. I'm sorry for directing my frustration your way. I strive to improve my interpersonal skills in this area, and any forbearance and patience you can spare is greatly appreciated. <p> I'm usually pretty cheerful, I think, so I hope you get to see more of happy\/friendly GTB, and less of frustrated\/annoyed GTB. -
[GTBacchus]: Hmm. I seem to have some kind of knee-jerk reaction when I see people talk about policy in certain ways. This is something I could think more about before I tell more people that they're \""entirely wrong\"". Interesting... -
[GTBacchus]: Point taken. -
[GTBacchus]: Hi. I'm about to close the move request at [[Female genital mutilation]]. I've read the discussion there, and I see you quoting the PNC. It's bothering me a little bit, because it feels really top-down. Then I realize that my analysis of the Gandhi move also had that characteristic. If we look at the written criteria, and then decide which title fits them best, then aren't we doing top-down rule-following? Maybe instead, we should stop quoting policy, and start weighing arguments on their own merits. <p> This is tricky, though, because the criteria are written down, so we appeal to them. It just... feels like law, and it's not law. Those criteria are ''definitely'' written incorrectly, and probably always will be, and we're not being very up-front about that. The one person opposing the move over there made an argument based on NPOV, and the other editors present didn't find the argument to be persuasive. Furthermore, the one opposing argument isn't one I've seen succeed in the past, so I don't think we're violating a previous consensus. That's why I'm going to move the page; not because of the naming criteria. Isn't that how it ought to be? <p> This does, of course, beg the question: Why write down criteria at all? I think the point is that a local consensus may not represent a global consensus. In cases where we see people agreeing to do something different from the criteria, we should verify that it's not just a local effect, and that the community at-large really wants to differ from the PNC in that case. That means that the PNC, far from being rules, are just touchstones to help us notice when the community is making a decision that contradicts prior decisions. <p> It's okay for us to contradict prior decisions, but we should do what it takes to be certain that the community really wants to do that. If the same kind of exception-making happens a lot, then we can add it to the criteria list, not so that people do what it says, but so that we know that it's not necessary to double-check, because that double-check has been done many times already. <p> I don't know, am I on the right track here? -
[GTBacchus]: I've been having similar thoughts about how that page is written. It's kind of sprawling and random now. <p> There's only one thing you've said here that I really disagree with. \""''every such case where ignoring rules prevails is almost certainly a good case for updating the written policy''\"". I think that's how you get sprawling, random policy pages. It's like begging for instruction creep. It would seem better to only update the policy page in cases where an exception has come up ''over and over again'', and consistently works out the same way. <p> In general, people focus way too much on those pages. I guess I see IAR differently, too. (No need to link; I know all 12 words of that policy, and I wrote most of [[WP:WIARM]].) I ignore all rules with every single edit that I make to this wiki. People should read policy pages a lot less, and think about them on rare occasions only. They should be far from our minds most of the time. We have to actively fight against policies being taken as rules, because if we don't, the problem grows, with instruction creep, red tape, and rampant wiki-lawyering. <p> When I say I always ignore all rules, I mean that I never take them to be rules. Every single edit is thought of on its own terms. For trivial edits, there's not much to think about (I've just sorted a few hundred stubs, and it was not mentally taxing), but that's still the ideal we're shooting for. <p> I agree with you about stability in titles, but I'm not willing to write down anything that looks like a rule until I've seen it established in the field many, many times. When we finally do write it down, it's better to phrase it as an observation than as a rule. Imperatives encourage lawyers. <p> I'll have a look at that page and think about what major edits might be possible. It could certainly use better organization, even if the content remains as it currently is. -
[GTBacchus]: Oh, semantic point: the fact that we call it \""ignoring rules\"" does not mean that the things we're ignoring really are rules, or should be thought of as such. It's a term of art, and it doesn't quite mean what it looks like it means. A big part of the point of IAR is that they aren't really rules, and that's why it's okay to ignore them. -
[GTBacchus]: Good point. I've cut that sentence, as it didn't really add anything. -
[GTBacchus]: Hey, Born2cycle. I don't know if this is the kind of suggestion you're looking for, but I really think it's the best and most helpful thing I can say... <p> Sometimes you have to let it go. None of us is in the position to make sure that everything goes the way it should go around here. A huge part of life is choosing your battles, and when it's clear that the tide is coming in, no matter how wrong the tide seems... nobody can fight the tide. Wait until next time around, and restate your case then, but you can't control these things. <p> Especially around an issue like abortion, we're simply not very likely to find an optimal solution, with respect to any number of details, and we just have to live with that. I was involved for months and months of my life, a few years ago, wrangling over the first sentence over the [[abortion]] article. That sentence currently sucks, and there's nothing I can do about that. <p> Honestly, the best you can do about issues that you really care about is to steer clear of them, and only work on things where you're not going to invest anything emotionally. There are things in your life that deserve your emotional investment more than Wikipedia does, and if you let something go, a dozen people will take your place and worry about it for you. <p> You, from what I've seen, seem to be an idealist, and that's a beautiful, beautiful thing to be. I wish the world were kinder to idealists, because I've got those leanings, too. However, the Wikipedia community gets some things wrong, no matter what sincere idealists may say, and there's just nothing we can do about that. You've got to take care of yourself before you worry about titles of articles here, and there's nothing shameful or weak about that. <p> I'm not even going to try and address the policy issues here, because nothing I can say will be helpful. Sometimes, you just have to walk away, and be an eventualist about it. Things will come out in the wash, someday. <p> I try to be extremely passive here, and just reflect what's happening in the community, rather than try to exert any kind of control. Wikipedia is never going to be rule-bound, or even consistent, and that's actually a really good thing. The day we're entirely consistent, Wikipedia dies. No joke. Find areas where you can make a difference, and work on those. Be prepared to give up more times than you succeed. The comic books don't show it, but Superman let a lot more people die than he ever saved. <p> You're a good one, Born2cycle. Hang in there, and don't wear it too hard. I'd like it if you're still here in 5 years, you know? -
[GTBacchus]: You clearly didn't read what I said. No \""theory\"" is involved, and I find your reply completely unnecessary and unhelpful, not to mention tacky and obnoxious. I suspect you're better than that. Why not rise to the occasion? -
[GTBacchus]: My apologies. The comment I was responding to was equally uncivil, and you didn't purge it. -
[GTBacchus]: I have no interest in pursuing this conversation with you, Kenatipo. Thanks for understanding. -
[GTBacchus]: Never interacted with the person before in my life, and I think your reading of my statement was wrong. I never delete ''anything'' from my talk page, though. Obviously we've got different standards. The whole \""got another theory?\"" comment was rude and obnoxious, and also seemed intentionally irrelevant. I was talking about one thing, and he\/she decided to attack your politics. I consider that to be tacky and obnoxious, and saying so is ''not'' uncivil. It's honest. -
[GTBacchus]: Thanks for that, Kenatipo. No hard feelings; on the contrary, it takes character to do what you just did. I look forward to seeing you around. -
[GTBacchus]: Responded above. I think we're all okay here. -
[GTBacchus]: Please pardon my interruption, but didn't B2c say that, ''according to your approach'', the ''current title'' is \""crap\""? That's a world of difference away from saying your approach is crap. -
[GTBacchus]: I guess we're just reading that differently. I'll refrain from further comment here, as I'm not trying to upset anyone. -
[GTBacchus]: I would say that, empirically, clarity ''is'' a criterion that people use to determine titles. When we wrote down our ''observations'' (not rules) of what criteria people use, we didn't think of that one. That doesn't mean it's not a valid criterion. Would you say that clarity is, empirically, not a criterion that Wikipedians sometimes use? What you're calling [[WP:CRITERIA]] is just a list of criteria that we noticed people using. That doesn't mean they're the only ones that are acceptable to invoke. -
[GTBacchus]: More briefly, [[WP:CRITERIA]] is not an exhaustive list of criteria that may be applied. It's just a list of criteria that we noticed people were using, repeatedly. It's ''observation'', not law. -"
Bilz0r,False,"[Bilz0r]: Thanks for the nice comment on the spacticty image. I'm still really learning, but this is as good a place as any to practice, and I felt that was an article that really could do with a nice picture. I was scared to say I could \""contribute with a good level at vector graphics\"", incase people thought that that image wasn't very good. I.e. it's better to more skilled than you say you are, than to say you're more skilled than you truly are."

He writes novels that tend to be trashy, angry and worthwhile (an odd combination, I know): good for long flights. His characters tend to be two dimensional and his plotting has its ruts; I've read at least two novels by him that I thought were no more than tiresome pastiches of his best stuff, which I thought very good indeed (in their sordid way).

[Nishkid64]: Alright. This is old signature that I had until 3 days ago. --
[Nishkid64]: --
[Nishkid64]: --
[Nishkid64]: You're missing something here. I did not say you vandalized the page. I warned the IP address who edited the page after you and added all the \""gay\"" stuff. Why do you keep thinking I'm accusing you of vandalism? --
[Nishkid64]: Check out the user_talk page history. I did not warn you about the article. I warned the IP address. All the edits I made to this page were part of the conversation we have right now under this section heading. --
[Nishkid64]: --
[Nishkid64]: Hi, I just wanted to tell you that I have responded to the user question you added to my RfA page. Click [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship\/Nishkid64|here]] to see my response. Thanks! --
[Nishkid64]: Hehe, okay. I added a response to Question 9A now. Check the RfA page. --
[Nishkid64]: Yay! Yeah, I was thinking that's probably what other admins would make mistakes on. I guess if they refresh their memory by taking a look at the admin how-to-guide and the Wikipedia guidelines, such problems could be averted. --
[Nishkid64]: --
[Nishkid64]: Thanks! --
[Nishkid64]: Oh !@#$%. I take that back. I really need to get my eyes checked out. It was blanked by creator. My bad, aero. However, I don't understand why the creator blanked the redirect link. It's a valid redirect link that doesn't exist. Should I put it back in? --
[Nishkid64]: I noticed the sporadic editing by the user, and that was why I made the initial block of one week. I have changed it to one day now, because I don't want this block to affect other potentially good users from editing on Wikipedia. My reasoning for the initial block was because the edits were so spaced out, and the person had vandalized every few days, and I thought if I blocked them for a week, I could possibly discourage them from contributing negatively to Wikipedia. --
[Nishkid64]: Okay, I have a question here. See [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Special:Log\/block&page=User:24.75.176.130 here].  I was about to block that user for maybe a day or two, but not for a whole month like DVD did. Would this be a case in which a long-term block is appropriate because the user has only made bad edits? I would think that is the reason for his decision (and also because the last block was a month long), but I just want to make sure. Thanks for answering my question. --
[Nishkid64]: It seems that the vandal who kept adding porn links has stopped, so I have decided not to protect the page, since much of the material being added is done so by anonymous IP users. For future cases, please go to [[WP:RFPP]] and post your request for page protection there. Thanks. --
[Nishkid64]: You shouldn't be apologizing for this. It's my personal duty as an administrator to help other users when they have problems. These sort of things help Wikipedia, not hurt. --
[Nishkid64]: Thanks.
[Nishkid64]: Thanks! Now I understand this whole autoblock thing.
[Nishkid64]: Hahaha. ++
[Nishkid64]: [[Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser\/Case\/Listerin]] already established that you are indeed a sockpuppet. There's no point in trying to hide it when I can just go to your block log and see your history.
[Nishkid64]: [[Image:Stop_hand.svg|left|30px]] This is your '''last warning'''. <br>The next time you [[Wikipedia:Vandalism|vandalize]] a page, you ''will'' be [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocked]] from editing Wikipedia. <!-- Template:Test4 (Fourth level warning) -->
[Nishkid64]: I fully protected the page so only sysops can edit or move.
[Nishkid64]: I apologize, Mattisse, if it seemed I was going against you on this issue. I had a different understand of the applications of the sockpuppetry tag and I guess that's why I reverted your page. As stated in the protection log, I only temporarily protected the page because I did not want the situation to escalate any further that it would result in a block made by another admin. Again, I'm sorry for this.
[Nishkid64]: Hey, don't be so down about your RfA. Although you had some minor setbacks, I'm sure that a few months of good editing and doing the things you suggested will definitely lead you to a successful RfA. Best of luck.
[Nishkid64]: Congratulations, Plange! Have fun with the new toolset. If you have any admin-related questions, feel free to contact me. =)
[Nishkid64]: Not a serious matter, but I personally think that if you don't really have anything to say about the project itself, then it shouldn't be said. I'm talking about [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AWikiProject_Comics&diff=83502418&oldid=83501432 this]. It was brought to my attention by another user, so I just wanted to let you know. Thanks. By the way, how's the first two weeks of adminship been?
[Nishkid64]: Although it may be have been cited in the New York Times (which probably was just a brief bit or two), it really is not a notable company in its own respect. If you Google the company, you get <1000 hits, and the only links in the article are to the company website. There is no other way to verify any factual content besides going to the actual website.
[Nishkid64]: Congrats Os! If you ever need help with the new tools, you know where to reach me. =)
[Nishkid64]: Congrats Saxi! Best of luck with the new tools, and if you ever have admin-related questions, feel free to contact me. =)
[Nishkid64]: Stop removing prod tags. People write \""\""NN\"" or something like that in their prod statement. Just because you think that's not sufficient, don't remove the tag. Either, fix up the article yourself and remove the tag, or just leave it alone. Almost all prods are deleted within 5 days, and when we do delete them, we systematically review over the article, and judge if it should be kept on Wikipedia. '''
[Nishkid64]: I do think [[Ayesha Sana]] is not notable. Judging from the lack of links from other articles and the number of G-hits (although not always accurate), I don't believe they are notable. And I can't find any external links that can verify any possible future additions tot he page. The appropriate thing to do here is to send to AfD then. '''
[Nishkid64]: Kappa, how can you be sure that other users will think that the article should not be prodded? If you are thinking about what other Wikipedians will think, then you must also believe that there are others who will want to delete the article. You have to look at both sides here, not just one. '''
[Nishkid64]: Sorry I responded late, but thanks for the great co-nom note. =) Have fun as admin, and if you '''''ever''''' need help, you know where to find me. '''
[Nishkid64]: I always wondered but I had forgot to ask, but was the misspelling of your name intentional? '''

[Nishkid64]: Hey Wknight, I got a question regarding an image I recently uploaded [[:Image:LeeSmith.jpg]]. I just wanted to know if my licensing was right, and if it all legit? I tried checking over other baseball card images and it seems that I can do this, but I'm not totally sure since I got this image from Baseball Almanac. Thanks for looking into it. '''
[Nishkid64]: Hmm...okay then. I do have a Lee Smith baseball card from 1997 (somewhere around there), but I don't have a scanner. I added the fair use rationale for the image, and hope everything goes well. Does anyone exactly decide upon the image's fate or something? '''
[Nishkid64]: Okay, thanks. Question: that Carlos Delgado image? Was that a MLB.com image? '''
[Nishkid64]: Heh, you lucked out. About the time of my RfA, Meegs requested me to deleted 100+ images that I got from MLB.com. It was really annoying going to each article and removing the image and then deleting the image afterwards. By the way, it seems there are loads and loads of MLB.com images on baseball player pages. Want to discuss it on [[WP:WPBB]] and [[WP:WPBBP]] so people will know for future reference? '''

[Nishkid64]: The user vandalized [[Tera Patrick]] at 21:42 UTC, and I saw the AIV report and issued a missing t4 warning at 21:43 UTC. Although I don't mind, the user did not vandalize after the t4 warning, and therefore shouldn't have been blocked. Anyway, I just wanted to let you know for future purposes. =)Best, '''
[Nishkid64]: Btw, the block would have been approved by many others had the first warning been given today, but it wasn't. It was given on the 16th. '''
[Nishkid64]: Yeah I noticed that too, but it was the first warning given on the day after a period of 11 days without warnings. Whatever, it doesn't really matter. '''
[Nishkid64]: A instructive and informative approach is better since people will actually learn from the mistake, and may come back to help ITN, DYK, or whatever it is, in the future. Btw, do you really expect me to patrol your contributions and see whose side you are on lol? '''
[Nishkid64]: Also, I am afraid to change ITN images b\/c I think I would screw things up. That's why I only work with the DYK images. '''
[Nishkid64]: It's a current event article, and someone felt that semi-protecting such an article would not be beneficial. It was only protected to temporarily prevent vandalism. If you look at the article's history, there are IP users who have made contributions to the article. If there are 20 IP vandals, and 4 good editors, I would never protect the article. It defeats the purpose of Wikipedia. '''
[Nishkid64]: Btw, this is just for now. I probably will protect soon, if the level of vandalism continues. '''
[Nishkid64]: No, I said 20 vandals and 4 good guys; not the opposite way around. '''
[Nishkid64]: Yeah, I semi-protected Saddam Hussein. The level of vandalism on there was insane. Alright, I'll also protect Gerald Ford now. '''
[Nishkid64]: I already removed entry to make way for yours. I'll get it in next time. Thanks for helping out btw. =) '''
[Nishkid64]: By the way, I replied to your comments about one of my DYK suggestions.[http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Template_talk:Did_you_know#December_27] Tell me if you think it's fine now. '''
[Nishkid64]: Thanks, ERcheck. I like the new DYK better than the old one. It's now short and sweet. Happy New Year, btw. =) '''
[Nishkid64]: Check out [[T:DYKT#December_27]]. Tell me if you understand the wording of the entry. It's a great article, and I'd like to see it on DYK, but the wording's a wee bit off. Thanks for any help. '''
[Nishkid64]: Thanks for your contributions! '''
[Nishkid64]: Just a suggestion, John. Can you please try to re-word\/shorten your DYK's. I noticed that some of yours have been exceeding in length, and seem too verbose, to say the least. Thanks again for all your DYK's. =) '''
[Nishkid64]: Hi, I saw you were removing the Infoplease references and replacing them with the United States Congress, since they are identical (and come from the US Congress). Do you want me to change all the Infoplease references in all my articles to US Congress only? I didn't want to have a whole bunch of lettered sections for one reference, so I chose to split them between Infoplease and US Congress. Thanks for any advice. '''
[Nishkid64]: Okay, done. =) '''
[Nishkid64]: I would appreciate it if you would not unprotect the [[Gerald Ford]] for at least a week or so because this has been a high-vandalism target since the former president's death. As Wikipedia policy ([[WP:SEMI]]) states: ''Other pages linked from the Main Page may be protected if under attack, though more leeway should be given with these than with most articles.'' This article has been hit more frequently that some of the featured articles of late, and I would think it would be appropriate not to unprotect the article for a while. '''
[Nishkid64]: I'm going under the assumption that the users who want to actually seriously edit the article will be curious as to why they can't edit and wander to the talk page and ask there. Most IP edits have been vandalism, though. Another reason why I am requesting this is because it is a Featured Article, and through the various IP vandalism changes, it has been hard to track down the proper non-vandalized form of the page. Thanks. '''
[Nishkid64]: Thanks for your contributions! This shouldn't have gone up on the Main Page this soon, but I guess the people who added it to Next Update didn't know about our general policy with DYK. '''
[Nishkid64]: Thanks for your contributions! '''
[Nishkid64]: I have February 2007 already selected. This weekend I'm planning to add four more months to the rotation of articles, pictures and the new anniversary section. If you have any suggestions, let me know. =) '''

[Nishkid64]: Unjust block, JPS? The user made honest mistakes with the images. The best thing would have been to discuss before blocking. By the way, I have been in correspondence with this user on MSN, and I have been looking at his images and such. '''
[Nishkid64]: We know he's Molag Bal. We gave him another chance, and he has since taken advantage of it and contributed to Wikipedia. We told him if he did anything wrong, we'd block him indefinitely as a sockpuppet. Regardless of this, the block still seems unjust when it's a new user who isn't quite familiar with image tagging. '''
[Nishkid64]: Not really, JPS. I only let the 1-hour block go because Rasillon just went offline (on MSN). '''
[Nishkid64]: As will we (Martin and I). '''
[Nishkid64]: Well, {{admin|Academic Challenger}} blocked the user indefinitely, but he did leave a note on the block log that it was a vandal sockpuppet. If the guy comes back tomorrow under a different account, then I'll consider temporary protection of the article(s). '''
[Nishkid64]: And, I have watchlisted both pages. '''
[Nishkid64]: Thanks for your contributions! '''
[Nishkid64]: Okay, semi-protected. I don't know why VoA declined at the time, but it currently looks like it needs to protection. '''
[Nishkid64]: Since I'm not particularly sure how long we'll need this, I did not specify an expiry date for the protection. '''
[Nishkid64]: Despite the fact that this user has not contributed the encyclopedia and has made vandalism edits, I won't block him\/her until the user has been sufficiently warned if he\/she continues in the future. '''
[Nishkid64]: Okay, I talked with Betacommand just now. I re-protected your user page, and he was fine with that. I will only unprotect if you want your page unprotected. I usually won't unprotect unless the user requests it. '''
[Nishkid64]: Just to let you know, I e-mailed you. Making the RfA page right now. '''
[Nishkid64]: Btw, are you a male\/female? I think I know, but I just need some confirmation :-P. '''
[Nishkid64]: Page has now been created. Would you mind if {{User|Steel359}} also co-nommed the RfA? He was planning to nominate you, and he just missed out :-P. '''
[Nishkid64]: Well, first accept the nomination :-P. [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship\/Fan-1967]. Then tell me and I'll transclude it or you can transclude it yourself, but let me know. I need to get vote #1. In all of my RfA noms, I end up getting vote #30 or something. :S '''
[Nishkid64]: Meh, you're running at 55% or so, and it doesn't look good from here. Regardless, the RfA should be a good learning process, and I can definitely see you back up in a few months. I mean, most of the oppose votes only concern your biting, civility and mistaken CSD tagging, and that can easily be fixed with a few months of more experience and improvement. Best of luck in this RfA, Fan. '''
[Nishkid64]: I'm sorry it had to end that way, but I am glad it served as a learning experience, for the both of us. Hopefully you can improve based on the opposition votes, and maybe I can nominate you again in the future. '''
[Nishkid64]: Thanks for your contributions! '''
[Nishkid64]: The rule has not changed, but we have been backlogged lately, due to the lack of updating. I've been doing my normal twice-daily updates, but whenever I go back on the next day, I see DYK has not been updated for 10+ hours at a time (yesterday, it wasn't updated for 23 hours!). Hopefully, if we get more admins in Europe or other places to update, then we can fix the backlog issues. '''
[Nishkid64]: I don't think we can get past this backlog if we keep going back to items that are nearly 7-8 days old. Send Jan 28 + Jan 29 to expired, and add January 30th items. '''
[Nishkid64]: Thanks for your contributions! '''
[Nishkid64]: Thanks for your contributions! '''
[Nishkid64]: I did not really take that comment by Nkras to be a threat. I'm not in light of the whole situation, but I thought he was saying if more people like him edited these articles, then it will teach people the meaning of consensus. I'll talk to the user, though. '''
[Nishkid64]: Yeah I did read them. I think his edit summaries were suggesting that he might use meatpuppets, but what I was referring to was the comment made by Nkras that he kept adding to the page. I might be misinterpreting what Nkras' IP said. '''

In regards to [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=J._R._Richard&diff=prev&oldid=136965140], why do you think including his dimensions is a bad idea? Usually, sports-related articles mention the height and weight of the athlete. In this case, it's something to note, because he was much taller than probably 99% of all professional baseball players. Perhaps, I should mention that to clarify as to why it is noteworthy to include in the article. Also, I replied to your comments at the FAC page. I'll try to find something about Richard, but I don't think that's likely going to happen. There's hardly anything written about him, besides his baseball career.

[Nishkid64]: IMO, the article asserts notability (rookie-league team under the St. Louis Cardinals, a MLB team). The level of notability can be debated at AfD, but that's not another matter. <span style=\""background:#E0FFFF;color:#007FFF;font-family:Georgia;\"">

[Nishkid64]: Once you purge your cache, you should see a new tab (next to \""history\"" at the top) when you edit a user talk page or article talk page. On the user talk, it will be listed as \""user talk dyk\"" and on article, it will say \""article talk dyk\"". When you click on \""user talk dyk\"", there are 3 menu options: \""dyk-auth\"", \""dyk-nom\"" and \""unsigned2\"". Ignore unsigned2. When you are crediting the author of an article, click the first one. It will prompt you for the title of the article (no link brackets are needed). Press enter, and then save the page. For the article talk page, you just need to press \""dyk talk no sig\"" and save the page. Does that clarify things? <span style=\""background:#E0FFFF;color:#007FFF;font-family:Georgia;\"">

[Nishkid64]: Okay, but wouldn't AVG free just detect the rootkit because it was attempting to control the computer? As far as I know, anti-virus software detect rootkit signatures and report them to the user. It does not differentiate between what is good and what is bad. I think it's safe to say that Zybez's rootkit is safe (I haven't seen any widespread complaints about this. The tools seem to be working fine for people).

[Nishkid64]: [[J. R. Richard]] is currently at [[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates\/J. R. Richard|FAC]]. Laser brain requested that the article be copyedited by someone who has yet to see the article. I've seen you copyedit articles on many occasions before, so I was wondering if you could comb through the article for prose issues and grammatical errors?

[Nishkid64]: Oh, right! I remember that now! Well, could you take a look at the article again? There have been some changes to the text? <span style=\""background:#E0FFFF;color:#007FFF;font-family:Georgia;\"">
[Nishkid64]: Well, it looks like there are conflicting reports regarding the number of volumes in Lardner's ''Cabinet Cyclopaedia''. [http:\/\/books.google.com\/books?client=firefox-a&um=1&q=%22Dionysius+Lardner%22+%22133%22+volume+Cabinet+Cyclopedia&btnG=Search+Books 133] v.

The article on [[Dionysius Lardner]] claims it was 134 volumes, but that's coming straight from [http:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=pO_gCtlJRWwC&pg=RA1-PA214&dq=Dionysius+Lardner+%22134%22+volume+Cabinet+Cyclopedia&lr=&ei=qfA2SNP9DoT6yASG8aXMDw&client=firefox-a Encyclopedia Brittanica]. <span style=\""background:#E0FFFF;color:#007FFF;font-family:Georgia;\"">
[Nishkid64]: Thanks! I just wanted to let you know that I didn't translate the \""Canton administrator and union leader\"" section. I only recently took up translation with Biruitorul after Editorofthewiki hadn't edited the page in over two months. All three of us are now working on translation. It'd be great if you could join or even proofread. :) <span style=\""background:#E0FFFF;color:#007FFF;font-family:Georgia;\"">
[Nishkid64]: I too noticed the problems with sourcing. I plan to look for alternative sources once the translation process is complete. I hope we can get mostly English sources, but that seems unlikely since Houphou\xebt-Boigny is primarily written about by French-speaking writers. <span style=\""background:#E0FFFF;color:#007FFF;font-family:Georgia;\"">
[Nishkid64]: Alright, I'll start removing Gbagbo and replacing it with other reliable sources and I'll look into Mundt's work. We're now in the proofreading stage, so it'd be great if you could copyedit the article. Thanks, <span style=\""background:#E0FFFF;color:#007FFF;font-family:Georgia;\"">

[Nishkid64]: No sources? Someone had screwed up the bottom of the article with [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=2008_Wah_bombing&diff=233334459&oldid=233334376 this edit]; that's why you didn't see the references section. <s>Still, I don't see how you could have thought there were no sources, since there were multiple footnotes present in the article.<\/s> Nevermind, looks like you saw that now. And what's with this bureaucracy over discussing clear ITN-worthy candidates? A number of similar terrorist attacks have been added to ITN in recent months.

[Nishkid64]: I've just started college again, but since the early days aren't too stressful, I think I can manage focusing my attention on FHB for the month. I also picked up some English sources on FHB, so I will be adding more references to the article in the near future. <span style=\""background:#E0FFFF;color:#007FFF;font-family:Georgia;\"">
[Nishkid64]: It's a pretty big range. However, I thought the block would not do much harm, since it's anon. only, account creation blocked. <span style=\""background:#E0FFFF;color:#007FFF;font-family:Georgia;\"">

[Nishkid64]: I confirm Coren's findings. Hullaballoo Wolfowitz is {{unrelated}} to the IP. <span style=\""background:white;color:#007FFF;font-family:Georgia;\"">
[Nishkid64]: {{user|Gercekkaynarca}} is {{confirmed}}. He bypassed my two hard rangeblocks by requesting IP block exemption last month. In addition, this user was editing on {{IPuser|83.66.22.10}}, which appears to have been used by blocked sockpuppeteer [[user:Justice Forever|Justice Forever]]. From a cursory glance, they appear to be the same user. Coincidence? <span style=\""background:white;color:#007FFF;font-family:Georgia;\"">
[Nishkid64]: I hope this will enhance your editing, and allow you to edit successfully and without disruption. <span style=\""background:white;color:#007FFF;font-family:Georgia;\"">
[Nishkid64]: Although the [[WP:1RR|1RR]] parole you received in February was for only three months, might I suggest you try your best to sticking to discussion instead of engaging in edit wars? If I find you engaging in edit warring in the future, I may [[WP:BLOCK|block]] you and place you on permanent 1RR parole. <span style=\""background:white;color:#007FFF;font-family:Georgia;\"">
[Nishkid64]: No compromise was reached. The side against you has been arguing that \""foreign Iraq\"" is misleading terminology. I won't revert you, but start discussing on the article page. <span style=\""background:white;color:#007FFF;font-family:Georgia;\"">
[Nishkid64]: With [[user:Scibaby|Scibaby]], who is essentially treated as a banned user, the policy is [[WP:RBI|revert, block, ignore]]. If you want that section in the article, you're going to have to bring it up on the talk page, since I know at least a dozen editors will revert you on sight if that comes back in. <span style=\""background:white;color:#007FFF;font-family:Georgia;\"">
[Nishkid64]: \""Essentially treated as a banned user\"" in that his edits are reverted on sight. This guy is an indefinitely blocked serial POV pusher, who's disrupted global warming-related articles for more than three years now (he's created hundreds of accounts during that span). Surely you can't think that reverting someone who's not welcome to Wikipedia and is only here to push some fringe POV is an act in violation of policy? <span style=\""background:white;color:#007FFF;font-family:Georgia;\"">
[Nishkid64]: Did you bother clicking the link to Scibaby's user page. If you had, you would have seen the note on the userpage that Scibaby is indefinitely blocked. There ya go: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Special:Log\/block&page=User:Scibaby]. Want more? See this [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Category:Wikipedia_sockpuppets_of_Scibaby], which contains a list of all Scibaby [[WP:SOCK|sockpuppets]] blocked by a [[WP:CU|CheckUser]]. Scibaby's only here on Wikipedia to post Global warming denialist claims. That's why he was blocked back in 2006 and that's why we continue to block his accounts. I myself blocked two Scibaby sockpuppet accounts earlier today ([http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Special:Log&user=Nishkid64]). <span style=\""background:white;color:#007FFF;font-family:Georgia;\"">
[Nishkid64]: There's a difference between being [[WP:BAN|banned]] and being [[WP:BLOCKED|indefinitely blocked]]. Scibaby is the latter, but since he's treated like a banned user (in that his edits are reverted), I felt that I had to make that distinction clear. Posting global warming denialist claims isn't itself a blockable offense, but the level to which Scibaby engages in such behavior is quite clearly disruptive. Most of the time, he creates sockpuppet accounts to add to articles that global warming is not caused by humans (in fact, he keeps adding info that global warming is caused by cow dung to every single global warming-related article). I'm not familiar enough with James Hansen to assess the relevance of the Capitol Power Plant protest controversy, but it seems the matter was deleted because of certain BLP and POV issues. An example of a POV issue in the article is the last sentence (global warming protests hampered by record snowfall), which is quite clearly an attempt at irony on Scibaby's part. The BLP issues arise when one considers Scibaby's motives. He's here to discredit James Hansen, and he's doing so by including the negative comments made by Chris Horner and John Theon. I'd suggest bringing this up on the talk page of the article and seeing what everyone else has to say. <span style=\""background:white;color:#007FFF;font-family:Georgia;\"">
[Nishkid64]: Look, I don't know enough about Hansen to comment on criticism leveled against him. You'll get a much better response from the editors on [[Talk:James Hansen]]. What good is it if we let the edits made by indefinitely blocked users stay in the encyclopedia? That goes entirely against the whole principle of being blocked\/banned. The way we handle Scibaby socks ([[WP:RBI]] and [[WP:DENY]]) is a well-established tactic used to combat blocked\/banned users. Ask around for yourself and you'll find out. I ask that if you want to discuss content, go to the article talk page. Else, we can continue this discussion on my talk page (sorry for the distractions, Kanonkas!). <span style=\""background:white;color:#007FFF;font-family:Georgia;\"">
[Nishkid64]: I agree with J.delanoy's CU findings. In addition, the SPAs all seem to be targeting Bishonen, who I know Mattisse has some issues with, based on previous encounters at FAR, AN\/I, and other drama huts. <span style=\""background:white;color:#007FFF;font-family:Georgia;\"">
[Nishkid64]: Mattisse has been here for 3 years. We're supposed to just give her a slap on the wrist for sockpuppetry now? I don't think the user should be unblocked, but perhaps the block could be reduced to 31 hours or something along those lines. <span style=\""background:white;color:#007FFF;font-family:Georgia;\"">
[Nishkid64]: Furthermore, this looks to me like a clear case of [[WP:GHBH]], which by definition is a violation of our sockpuppetry policy. <span style=\""background:white;color:#007FFF;font-family:Georgia;\"">
[Nishkid64]: \""All users are proscribed from operating a \""bad hand\"" account for the purpose of disruption or artificially stirring up controversy.

Mandavo88,False,"[Mandavo88]: How do i use this template? I've read the documentation, but I can't find a place to enter my hash string."
Polyparadigm,False,"[Polyparadigm]: --
[Polyparadigm]: Kinetics aside, I would say that different critical temperatures would add to the structural & chemical evidence of a profound difference between the ordinary phases of lead and tin.  The same arguments (especially structural) would then carry over to the respective superconducting phases.  I'd also expect Cooper pairs to scatter at the phase boundary, since lead and tin have different crystalline structures, which implies that both phonons and electrons travel differently in each phase.  Then again, I know relatively little about superconductivity.  I imagine that if enough mixing occured for higher-temperature phase stability, Tc would become quite low in both cases.  Does this clarify anything?  I have the feeling I've misunderstood your question.--
[Polyparadigm]: I see your point, and understand that the way you use the word \""phase\"" is consistent and useful to you, and I have never suggested that it be removed from the article.  However, in my field the word is used differently, as per the definition (rather than the examples) at the head of the article.  That usage is also consistent and useful in its context, so I believe that the article should reflect both meanings of the word.  Notice also that my first arguments were about macroscopic behavior: eutectic behavior means that the solids are prone to phase separation, regardless of the underlying details of crystal structure or electron affinity.  I only mentioned microstructure and composition as an easy way to distinguish one phase from another; the important thing is that some nonuniformity arises.  In my use of the term, a stable boundary is what really defines distinct phases, rather than quantitative differences in their viscoelasticity, compressibility, ionization state, etc.--
[Polyparadigm]: Seeing no response, I will put back some of the material that you reverted--especially the oil and water example--in the next couple of days.  I believe that both of our understandings of this concept belong in the article: limiting it to your definition may lead to confusion of its own, since my understanding is more consistent with the use of the term \""phase\"" in some of the other articles on the site ([[ice]], as mentioned above, but also [[eutectic]] etc.).  You have given me some good perspective on the differences between solid state physics and materials science, so I'll be careful to only make assertions about my own field, but I would like your assurance that changes you make to my contribution will be constructive this time.  Please feel free to give whatever other input you wish of course, either before or after I make the changes, or alternatively to add material back in a form which you find acceptable.  Regards,
[Polyparadigm]: I agree that the part you quoted is wrong, and won't try to include it.  I'll also try to be careful to distinguish between phase in the ''transition'' sense of the word vs. phase in the ''equilibrium'' sense of the word.  I have some ideas; we'll see what you think of them.  Thanks for discussing, it has been (& will probably continue to be) illuminating.--
[Polyparadigm]: He seems to be in the habit of reverting things he doesn't agree with, rather than bringing them up on the article's \""talk\"" page.  But good luck in your endeavor, Vicarious, and I hope you can come to a compromise where I've failed.--
[Polyparadigm]: CYD: Sorry, that was impolite of me.  I am happy to accept that my edits are wrong, unless the facts in question are backed up by all of the literature in my field as well as every class lecture, seminar, or conference that I have attended and countless well-written Wikipedia articles that I have not edited.  I'm still baffled by the results of our debate on the definitions of the word \""phase\"", and my colleagues laugh when I explain it to them, but I've decided to work on other things for a while and leave that conundrum until later.  I also gave up because at one point I was worried that you would go through materials\/geology articles and force their use of \""phase\"" to conform to yours, but now I think that gives you too little credit.  Again, sorry for my lack of tact.--
[Polyparadigm]: Do these really have a highly nonlinear PTC response?  I thought that SiC, as a traditional semiconductor, was NTC.  Only the titanates were mentioned in the class I took, but please correct me if I'm wrong.  I'm also surprised to see SiC listed as a commercial heating element, and especially MoSi2: aren't these reserved for scientific\/industrial furnaces?--"

I suppose we could try just warning or blocking the IP address that is doing it, but I suspect the page will end up with the same sort of problems as the main hoax page. --
[Brianyoumans]: Could you perhaps do the latest revert on this article?  And, what do you think should be the next step?  I admit that the last time I asked might have been a bit early to take action, but, if you look at the talk page, things have deteriorated a bit.
[Brianyoumans]: Thanks for stepping in and helping out with this!
[Brianyoumans]: ...and again, thanks.  I'm afraid I have an unfortunate urge to try to talk sense into people like this, but most of the time reason just makes them worse.  I'll stop responding to him now.  --
[Brianyoumans]: Since you removed a previous prod on this article, I thought you might be interested that I just sent it to AFD. (You might look at the big honking list of Ohio libraries I sent to AFD as well.) --
[Brianyoumans]: I've added the \""{{tl|prod}}\"" template to the article [[Engro Chemical]], suggesting that it be deleted according to the [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|proposed deletion]] process. All contributions are appreciated, but I don't believe it satisfies Wikipedia's criteria for inclusion, and I've explained why in the deletion notice (see also \""[[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not|What Wikipedia is not]]\"" and [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy|Wikipedia's deletion policy]]). Please either work to improve the article if the topic is worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia, or, if you disagree with the notice, discuss the issues at [[Talk:Engro Chemical]]. You may remove the deletion notice, and the article will not be deleted, but note that it may still be sent to [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion|Articles for Deletion]], where it may be deleted if consensus to delete is reached, or if it matches any of the [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|speedy deletion criteria]].
[Brianyoumans]: Since I haven't seen any improvements or arguments about why this is notable, I have sent it to AFD. --
[Brianyoumans]: Since I was wrong and Engro ''does'' meet WP:CORP (I should have done better research in advance), I have improved the article somewhat.  I hope you like it! --
[Brianyoumans]: A ramp and a highway are sometimes hard to tell apart - some \""ramps\"" go on for miles. However, I suppose someone could make some criteria up and then sort the article into ramps and highways.  Then, a few months down the line, the article could be split in two.  Of course, as a deletionist what I would do is go through and eliminate everything that is unreferenced and sounds non-notable - which would probably reduce the article by 75% or more. Unfortunately, the \""highwayspotters\"" wouldn't stand for it, I'm sure. :-) --
[Brianyoumans]: Well, if it does, provide some references the next time you create an article on them - probably some newspaper articles that mention them. And try adding the info to the Christchurch article instead of creating an article just for the gang. --
[Brianyoumans]: I don't know, offhand.  I'm afraid that I haven't really been a Wikipedia policy wonk. The \""disputed\"" tag was obviously inappropriate, though.  The answer may be that there isn't any such tag; there will always be ''someone'' who disagrees with a particular policy page; the question is, does a consensus of Wikipedians continue to support it? You could try running a poll by posting to various places and asking people to vote, but I suspect that you would find that most people support the idea of [[WP:NOTABILITY]] even if they may want to change it one way or another.
[Brianyoumans]: Gosh, you found me out.  I guess I failed to hide my deletionist activities carefully enough. :-)
[Brianyoumans]: How about some references from local newspapers about the gang? Actually, I'm pretty convinced that you are just a bored New Zealand teenager who listens to rap music and fancies himself in a gang. Believe me, you don't want a real gang in your town - innocent people get shot, rivals get beaten up and killed, people are afraid to leave their houses... Be happy you live in New Zealand and can fantasize about \""tough streets\"".
[Brianyoumans]: I reduced this article to a redirect to the school district because elementary schools are generally considered non-notable when they come up at AFD; second, this wasn't a school with any particular claim to notability that I could see. I was working on eliminating many - not all - of the articles, but in the last couple months I'm afraid I have been on somewhat of a Wiki-hiatus, and haven't made much progress. Why do you think this particular school needs an article?
[Brianyoumans]: Please take a look at AFD results for elementary schools - specifically in BC, [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\/100 Mile House Elementary School]] and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\/A S Matheson Elementary School]]. High schools generally win at AFD, but in my experience middle schools and elementary schools have to show actual notability. Personally, I feel that is a good idea - there are 100s of thousands of such schools worldwide, and I don't think we need that many poorly-maintained vandalism-magnets in Wikipedia. High schools are bad enough. Would you like to revert the article back to a redirect? Having these BC articles in Wikipedia just encourages other jurisdictions to put up (unwanted, in my view) articles on their elementary schools.
[Brianyoumans]: How about [[WP:NOT]], specifically \""Wikipedia is not a directory\"" and \""Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information\""? I can see that I'm not going to convince you, so I suppose this will have to go to AFD.
[Brianyoumans]: All I can say is that at the most fundamental level Wikipedia is a collection of articles which the editors of Wikipedia think are appropriate, and the consensus on Wikipedia at the moment seems to be that elementary school articles - in Canada or not - are not appropriate. Even on the WikiProject Education in Canada talk page, I see comments by a number of editors - Pomte, TheMightyQuill, Serpent's Choice - who are dubious that these articles should have been created; and frankly not much support for keeping them. On the other hand, I see no problem with adding some of this info to the school district pages; for those articles I changed to redirects, I tried to add current website links for the schools, for example. Those are less likely to go out of date than information like the principal's name.
[Brianyoumans]: Her obituary in the Charleston Gazette gives her name as \""Olivia\""; it seems not unreasonable that that was her given name. I think the article should stay under \""Livia\"", since that is what she is referred to as everywhere else.
[Brianyoumans]: Your revision is an improvement over the original, although I think simply leaving the origin of the holiday out of the lede is superior; it leaves less temptation for edit wars there. I guess you figured out that I hadn't actually removed Blight's research; in fact, it was still the first thing mentioned, and very prominently, in the History section. I just think it is a very contentious and arguable thing to say that the Charleston event was the \""start\"" or the \""founding\"" of Memorial Day - it really depends on what you mean by those terms."

[AFL-Cool]: Thanks. I've notified them of the error. Might be an idea to change the picture here from 1945 to 1946 (I believe it to be 1946 - Essendon and Melbourne)."
TheBFG,False,"[TheBFG]: I changed the sentence \u201cthe isotope <sup>238<\/sup>U (T<sub>\xbd<\/sub> = 4.5\xd710<sup>9<\/sup> a) of uranium occurs in nature, but the shorter-lived isotope, <sup>235<\/sup>U (T<sub>\xbd<\/sub> = 0.7 \xd710<sup>9<\/sup> a), is 138 times rarer\u201d, because having read the first part of the sentence, the reader would anticipate that the shorter-lived isotope does not occur in nature. You may say that anybody who is able to interpret a multiple sentence must come to the conclusion (after some consideration) that <sup>235<\/sup>U must also occur in nature. It is true. But the reader is either puzzled by the sentence and starts thinking about it (as I did), or skips the consideration part and fails to draw the correct conclusion. With my version (which may not be perfect) I tried to produce a sentence which does not need much considering. So I ask you to rephrase the sentence more carefully.--"

Throbert McGee,False,"[Throbert McGee]: Hi, Flyer22... I am '''extremely grateful''' for the time and effort you've put into answering the objections and nit-picking of \""Mijopaalmc\"" et al.! ''(I sort of understand where he's coming from, since \""Frot Granddaddy\"" Bill Weintraub is so fanatically opposed to sticking ''anything'' up the wazoo that his site forbids discussion of butt plugs and those \""Aneros\"" thingamajigs, even though such toys may be much safer for rectal penetration than a man's penis. But on the other hand, Weintraub is a Lone Voice In The Wilderness wailing against a tsunami of anal-oriented gay pr0n, with bareback stuff accounting for 25% of sales, by some estimates -- so I'm inclined to forgive his fanaticism.)'' Anyway, I especially appreciate your efforts because you're a chick and don't have a prostate, so it must've been tempting for you to recuse yourself from the whole debate on the \""I ain't got a dog in this fight\"" principle. But you didn't, and I thank you.
[Throbert McGee]: Do not conflate \""male orgasm\"" with \""ejaculation of semen.\"" Yes, they usually go hand-in-hand, but prostate massage can trigger an ejaculation '''without an orgasm'''. (Conversely, when I was a wee lad of about 11, I figured out how to masturbate myself to a dry orgasm five or six months before I had my first ejaculation.) And as long as I'm in full and candid disclosure mode, my considered opinion as a homosexual man who very occasionally enjoys \""bottoming\"" is that the pleasure from prostate massage is ''real'', but the DEGREE of pleasure has been hugely, enormously, CATASTROPHICALLY oversold within gay male culture. If there is any such thing as the \""male G-spot\"", it is the frenulum region on the underside of the penis shaft, not the prostate. (Which is why I'm a frot advocate.)"
Redthoreau,False,"[Redthoreau]: Also there is no way that the article has doubled in length .... you have to be calculating the size taking into account the pictures, post prose - which should not be considered when weighing the articles size.  Where is a link to the supposed size of the article? For my part I feel there is an irrational panic taking place with reference to the article's size that I feel is unnecessary. If anything the total time it takes to scroll down through the article has been DECREASED not increased (try it for yourself).
[Redthoreau]: The prose of the article is only 69 KB or so (now probably smaller) - size is not the issue. Those lists are deceptive because they take into account all material post-prose - much of which I have edited out now.  Also I trust you to make revisions on prose content so feel free.
[Redthoreau]: I saw that you have accused me of being a '''\""spa\""''' ? or a '''\""sock puppet.\""''' I am unaware of what these names refer to, thus I can not respond in my own defense. In the future I would appreciate if you brought future allegations to me personally and allow me to respond, and not resort to libel gossip, on others talk pages.
[Redthoreau]: What does it mean? And you said you agreed with him, that I was one ... thus how could you do so, if you didn't know what it meant ?
[Redthoreau]: It isn't enough for you just to declare ''\""no\""'' on a change that I make. Some actual rationale would be appreciated in the future. \""No\"" implies you to be the sole arbiter of Wikipedia like a proverbial Caesar giving a \""thumbs down.\"" I would contend that such behavior does not represent the spirit behind Wikipedia.  Is there a specific rule behind your refusal to allow quotes within a quote box?
[Redthoreau]: As for the \""same picture\"" ... I actually replaced the old one with one of a higher resolution and thus better quality. Apparently cosmetic improvements are not your forte.
[Redthoreau]: You have the audacity to warn me of \""insults\"". You labeled (by agreeing) me a \""Sock Puppet\"" and ''\""Spa\""'' basically spreading the libel that I was a phony user of someone else. Now when I bring up the REALITY, that you told me you were \""finished\"" with the article, you label that a personal attack? This would be funny, if it wasn't so disingenuous.
[Redthoreau]: [[Image:Nuvola apps important.svg|25px]] Then in the same spirit, Please Stop Vandalizing my Talk Page. Do not post on my talk page again, as you have made the same request of me.
[Redthoreau]: '''I have not made any personal attacks against you!''' You believe that the rules only apply to others and not yourself, and also wish to have the last word on your talk page and expect me '''not''' to answer your accusations. '''Name me the specific insults I have lobbed against you, or refrain from the false accusation.''' I can document 2 insults you made against me, and all I have done is pose the question of whether I should believe your own words, when you declare to everyone you are ''\""finished\""'' with a particular article or not? That is not an INSULT. And if you would like me to stop commenting on your page, then stop casting accusations against me on it.
[Redthoreau]: I realize we had a \""trist\"" but am glad to see us working well together at present. It's my hope the harmonious partnership will continue. I do have a request - which you can feel free to deny if you desire. I was wondering if you could create an additional blank spin off list entitled \""Additional materials on Che Guevara\"" for me, so that I can place the materials formerly listed in the article there? Thanks.
[Redthoreau]: I agree with most of the changes you have made thus far. and have a few requests. Can you change the name of the list article of CG's works to \""Books by Che Guevara\"" - I feel that would be more precise and accurate. On that article itself I can then specify that these are (English translations only). Also I have restored the external links for the time being until some more people give their input. I am not against moving them to a list (Especially the archival footage to it's own seperate list) but I do think that the other media links are worthy of staying (but am open to your reasoning why they would not be). In addition I put the wording in the first few sentences back to the earlier wording as the changes I felt were poorly constructed. Overall however I appreciate your efforts thus far and wish to remain collaborative on the changes.
[Redthoreau]: Matisse, what is with the aggressive response? I am confused. Whan I change something you refer to it as \""reverting\"" you, but when you change something I previously wrote it is seen as legitimate. I mentioned on the talk page my changes and am open for discussion on them. Please point out to me what you believe is POV as I am open to changing it. It is not a 3 RR violation to continue to improve the article as we both have been doing. My piece was written last night and this morning before your recent edits and thus were not an attempt to alter your recent edits. Let's please discuss this on the CG Talk Page. ;o)
[Redthoreau]: I had stopped editing it because I thought that in its current state it was going to be judged for FA status. I believed that everyone was sort of letting it remain as is. As I noticed that someone else was interested in continuing improvements, I then rejoined back in, under the hopes of working with you. A few issues: how are 2 links substantially more than 1 in the lead ? Most leads have 5+ from what I have seen. Also wouldn't any edit you do also be a revert, as you are altering changes I have personally made many times. The 3 RR rules refers to just hitting UNDO on your work and erasing it all. That is not what I have done. I am continuing to better the wording just as you are. You have removed countless sentences that were at one time added by another editor ... however this is not reverting ? But when I change a few sentences for wording - all of the sudden I have committed a cardinal sin ? I don't get it. Also what is POV in the lead ? I am open to correcting it, but you have given me 0 specifics.
[Redthoreau]: I appreciate the specific suggestions and believe I corrected the author issue by linking to the list of his books. As for the two words in a row, that is common throughout the article, which specific links (for example) do you believe should not be linked in sequence?
[Redthoreau]: I do not want an edit-war with you. Why won't you bring up your concerns in the lead to me so I can address your concerns and fix them, or give me a chance to explain my rationale for their inclusion. Actually you editing the lead would be the 3rd revert by you as well ... as it would be if I edited it, so that is an irrelevant point. Hell we have each edited wiring by each other countless times and that is not my concern. I want to be collaborative with you on this, but you are making things difficult with an overly aggressive tone and threats which are unnecessary. Wikipedia belongs to all of us, let's figure out a way to ensure everyone is able to use it how it was intended.
[Redthoreau]: correction ... '''I templated you after you falsely templated me'''. You are the one that drove everyone away, not me. You are the one that continues to hypocritically harass my talk page and then when I respond with the exact same behavior you freak out and attempt to run to moderators for cover. You continually tell me to stop contacting you, and yet contact me and ask others to also do so. I have continually requested you to work collaboratively and yet you refuse every time ... telling me to \""grow up\"" and refusing to be specific with your suggestions remarking that I am a \""grown up\"" whose hand you will not hold. Although yes to cover yourself you did post some specifics on your 4th \""I am leaving for good\"" declaration today. You are disrespectful, and impossible to deal with politely, even though I always do. The only reason I am responding here is because you always run to others and misrepresent the situation in an attempt to create a fictitious account of what happens. Your misrepresentation or reality is truly astounding and leads me to question your overall honesty. Please stop referencing me and I will finally be able to stop spending time defending myself against your made up accusations.
[Redthoreau]: [[Image:Information.svg|25px]] Hello. Your recent vandalism to [[Che Guevara]] has led to the article being closed for 5 days. Also You are being warned about personal harassing user [[User:Redthoreau|Redthoreau]] for the third time now. Further harassment will lead to formal complaints and possible loss of editing privileges.  This is you third warning of harassment today. {{#if:|{{{2}}}|Thank you.}}<!-- Template:Uw-warn -->   This is a warning ''
[Redthoreau]: '''Correction of the facts''' - as it is clear that Mattisse has an issue getting them correctly and lies more than any editor I have ever seen ''(by the way that is not a personal attack, but a fact, he makes factually incorrect statements at will about me)''. (1) I am not a \u201csingle purpose account\u201d, and have contributed to a wide range of articles since I first began editing a few months ago. Yes many of them have been related to a similar subject area, but that is the area that is my expertise, thus I edit accordingly ''(just as most of Mattisse\u2019s edits have to deal with a similar subject matter which I believe may be Psycholgy ... oh the irony)''. Also all I have ever wanted was to be treated the same as anyone else ... it is Mattisse who believes that since he has (44 K edits) that it allows him to play de-facto monarch of any article for which he is involved in. ----- Yes, please do look at the article history, read the talk page and take note of my demeanor in contrast to Mattisse. You will find that he declared he was finished with the article and demanded that I stop messaging about him around Noon yesterday (he is notorious for doing this in the past) ... only to come back in the afternoon and begin editing again and false templating me against wiki policy. When I point out that he makes statements publicly on the talk page \u2013 only to then act as if they haven\u2019t happened, and ponder openly how I can react to such ''\u201coddity\u201d'', he then from that impugns that I am attacking his mental state ''(which is not necessary, as the facts speak for themselves)''. I have come across a wide range of people in my life, and I am truly dumbfounded at whatever ''\u201creality\u201d'' Mattisse seems to be living in. = Nothing he says represents reality, and thus when I became angry after weeks of this and in response to him calling me a sock puppet I called him ''\u201cInsane\u201d''. An insult? Possibly, but also a medical diagnosis I believe ''(as I am not sure what else to call it)''. I have made countless pleas for him to '''(1)''' Stop Harassing me '''(2)''' Stop templating me against wiki policy -- which he has been warned from a moderator about '''(3)''' Stop mirroring my edits and placing tags on any article I work on as a way to cause annoyance '''(4)''' Stop lying about my behavior, creating a situation where I am justified in defending myself, and thus responding '''(5)''' Be civil and collaborative instead of rude, divisive, irrational, \u201ccrazy\u201d, and combative. ---- I will continue to defend myself against his lies, as I believe I am entitled that opportunity. I do not rant, something he does often, and only '''defend my right to answer the charges against me'''. I would just as much prefer to never have to leave a message on his talk page again ... but unfortunately he won\u2019t leave my talk page alone, and thus every time he leaves a message for me, I respond in turn, and then discover another libelous smear he is spreading about me. As I asked several times nicely yesterday ... Mattisse please follow wiki policy, and leave me alone. If you wish to discuss something about me do it on the article talk page. I will not respond to you unless you message me or attack me on your talk page. Thank you.
[Redthoreau]: Mattisse ... considering our recent and heated feud that has been taking place for several weeks ... '''I do find it questionable for you to now having taken ''interest'' in all of the articles that I have recently worked on.''' After not editing any of these articles ever before. Now sure every editor on wikipedia has the right to work on whichever article they wish ... and you could truly be interested in improving the quality of \""coincidentally\"" the same articles that I recently worked on ''(even though the probability of such an occurrence would be very low)'' --- thus it leads me to question your true genuineness of criticisms and critiques. Going through and excessively tagging every photo on every article I have worked on, along with POV tags, tone tags, length, tags etc ''(as if you are an administrator, which you are not)'' could be warranted ... but they could also be an example of an attempt to create \""annoyance\"". One that an administrator already warned you about this past week. I hope this is not the case, and that your motives are collaborative and not destructive. I would also contend that because of our past and very heated rivalry ... that it may be best for you not to mirror all of my edits, as you are already aware of our personal feud which as history shows us both, usually creates unnecessary frustration for the both of us.
[Redthoreau]: see my comment I am about to post on the talk page. Actually positive to negative ratio of reviews should be 5 to 1 based off of [http:\/\/www.metacritic.com\/film\/titles\/motorcyclediaries\/ Meta Critic] which has 32 positive and 6 negative reviews.
[Redthoreau]: In the interest of fairness, will you hold the same position if I \""suddenly\"" become interested in finding things to tag in all of the articles you have created or worked on?
[Redthoreau]: The Movie Poster for MD is now very large, and I have no idea why ?
[Redthoreau]: Coppertwig is willing to provide a process for all editors to go through each section and provide their suggestions, rationale for dispute, etc. If you wish to be a part of that, then please participate and allow (the valuable experience I know you have) to be utilized. An incessant preoccupation with article statistics is not helpful (especially since 1 edit solely in #, can be everything from adding a comma, to erasing an entire paragraph.) I take you at your word that you want to create a better article, so let's use the process Coppertwig is creating to reach consensus on the content, in order to develop an improved article.
[Redthoreau]: Is this somehow meant for me? If so I am not sure what you mean by the cryptic message, or what would have spurned it on.
[Redthoreau]: For starters you mentioned my name in your message, which is why I responded. Also the edit summary you cite is one by myself, thus it is normal for me to assume you are referring to me. As for your rude \""sending me to bed\"" I won't respond in kind, as I am committed to taking the high road with you for now on. So have a good night ;o).
[Redthoreau]: You still have yet to show how my information was '''inaccurate''', or '''incorrect''', despite the fact that I repeatedly have requested it ???
[Redthoreau]: color=\""#FFCC00\"">'''thoreau'''<\/font>]] (
[Redthoreau]: Please stop harassing me and the articles I work on with a barrage of tags in order to create frustration. Tags or criticisms from you are not in good faith, as our long and quarreling history shows. If this continues I will be forced to report you.
[Redthoreau]: I highly doubt this claim, as you and I personally have quarreled over the films article for the book. Just admit it, you enjoy causing me frustration, and this is not what Wikipedia is about. The article has not been tagged for weeks\/months in that state, and all of the sudden, the same person who has been edit warring with me for weeks, and been warned not to tag to harass, shows up with a barrage of tags and acts in an aggressive tone per usual.
[Redthoreau]: This is not about you finding one of your editor friends to agree with you either. How about lets get some separation, as we had the past few days which worked great for both of us. The probability of you stumbling upon the 2-3 articles I am working on, a few days after we have been warring for months is suspect. Please go your own way, to prevent us from having future edit wars, like in the past.
[Redthoreau]: How can I ? You have made false accusations about me, which still go unanswered, and we have been at \""edit war\"" for weeks ... I have extended an olive branch several times and been rebuked. It is not enough to hide behind the veil of \""good faith\"" now, as you attempt to reignite and instigate our dorment conflict.
[Redthoreau]: Even veiling it as \""one editor\"". The only thing egregious here is your behavior, and the amazing fact that after several days of peace, you are beginning to cause more conflict. You have treated me very badly for weeks ... I get along very well with all other editors I am working with right now ... the only problem comes with you, as you only act in bad faith, over, and over again. You never \""assume good faith\"" with me ... and it showed by you declaring me creating a \""glorifying\"" article. While I did show good faith, by addressing your \""would\"" suggestion. Your mis-recollection of events even within the last hour is truly astonishing.
[Redthoreau]: You see, instead of acting properly and messaging me expressing your view that the article was too \""praise worthy\"", '''you automatically assume [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=The_Motorcycle_Diaries&action=history BAD FAITH]''' and assume that I am purposely trying to GLORIFY Guevara, instead of assuming I may have a different view than you. instead of wanting to discuss on the talk page ... (especially considering our history) you resort to a barrage of tags meant to annoy.
[Redthoreau]: You had never edited this article before ... and had been editing articles on Hawaii for the past several days. Then all of the sudden as we had peace, you discover an article I have been working on, and instead of talking on the talk page, you start with a barrage of tags and attack me in the edit summary. Look at how harmoniously me and Coppertwig have worked on the CG article now that you have left. My problem is not with any editors ... it is with your behavior and bad faith actions.
[Redthoreau]: I haven't followed you around at all, realizing that per your usual behavior that you would seek out admins to misrepresent your case to (which you did again), I clicked on Contribs and saw that you have been making dozens of Hawaii themed edits. I never said you WERE NOT allowed to edit the article ... I claimed that you were acting in bad faith and to annoy.
[Redthoreau]: '''PLEASE READ CAREFULLY:''' [[Wikipedia:Village_pump_(policy)#another_use_of_POV_tags_and_other]] = There you have it. I expect you to cease your abusive use of article tags without justification, so that reporting you will not be necessary.
[Redthoreau]: It is not a personal attack to describe bad faith as so. The only time you show good faith, is when you repeat the word over and over lately '''(to cover yourself)'''. However your actions have been deplorable for weeks in relation to me, so forgive my skepticism. I see better than I hear.
[Redthoreau]: Also maybe you should read [[Wikipedia:Do not disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point]] and [[Wikipedia:Gaming the system]]
[Redthoreau]: Or maybe he was being nice and congratulating you on the Barn Star you mentioned. [[Wikipedia:Assume good faith|Assume Good Faith]] remember? ;o) &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
[Redthoreau]: '''I reserve the right to \""appear\"" anytime you mention my name. If you do not want me to \""appear\"" = then desist from talking about me ... it's that simple.''' Every editor has the right to defend themselves against their accuser. If you stopped making false accusations about me, then I could stop posting my defense. As for ''\""ruining\""'' it ... your paranoia ruined it, as you took a nice compliment by a fellow editor ''(who has always been kind and fair to you)'' and once again accused him of making an insult. Because I know [[User:Coppertwig|Coppertwig]] is a good person, I am sure he will show up and needlessly ''\""apologize\""'' for your misunderstanding ... as he usually does when you ''\""get upset\""'' over something that only occurs in your own mind. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
[Redthoreau]: = accept personal responsibility for your actions, and have a nice day. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
[Redthoreau]: Please do not use edit summaries to make false personal attacks. I have never harassed you, and this is not the way to deal maturely with the fallout from your poor behavior. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
[Redthoreau]: I have never and will never harass you. I am allowed to request that you not use edit summaries to make attacks against me, and then close your talk page. For the '''10th + Time''' .. please stop casting aspersions against me ... so that I can stop having to defend myself. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
[Redthoreau]: In the '''2 days''' since you have been back from your several week hiatus ''(in which I harmoniously edited - with 0 problems with other editors)'', you have made obvious veiled references to me as being a '''\""POV pusher\""''', '''\""aggressive\""''', '''\""amoral\""''', and '''\""abusive\""'''. You have made obvious but 'cleverly' veiled references to me not only on 2 editors talk pages [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User_talk:Coppertwig#Objection 1] [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User_talk:Iantresman 2], but also the Wikipedia Administrators' notice board [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard#User:Iantresman 3]. All of these have been unprovoked, as I have not had any contact with you in weeks - as I had ''(naively I guess)'', believed that you were finally willing to go about your way and edit without constantly making unfounded and merit-less attacks against me --- as you did during the several weeks where you made it a hobby to harass me, my talk page, and any article I was working on a daily\/hourly basis. For the 20 + time, '''please desist from constantly attacking me for no reason''' - and please use the talents I know you possess to be a productive wikipedia editor. I will be logging all of your attacks against me this time, and hope that it will not be necessary to seek administrative action. Thank you. &nbsp;&nbsp;[[Image:Smile icon.png|14px]]&nbsp;

Pretend I don't exist and desist from this obsession that you have with me, and every edit I make. I am astounded that you have taken it upon yourself to distribute your skewed interpretations on the reality of this situation all around Wikipedia ... it is not a case where the kid who yells the loudest is right. I want to be done with you, I want to never have to address you again ''(as was the case the several weeks when you were on vacation and thus were not harassing me)'', but you constantly on a daily basis create situations where I am justified in responding to your allegations against me.

[Redthoreau]: Hello '''TDogg310''', nice to meet you. I wanted to first express my appreciation of the work and edits you made to wiki'izng' [[Che Guevara]]. I did however have one question of clarity. You switched the dates from the Middle endian form ''(used in the United States)'' of Month\/Day\/Year to the Little endian form ''(used in most other nations)'' of Day\/Month\/Year. The issue was previously discussed with relation to the article, and it was decided to use the Middle endian form ... with that said is there a specific rationale for why you changed these dates, or do you merely believe it looks better\/works better\/makes more sense etc? I can see the arguments for both forms, although yes I do favor the previously used Middle form. Thanks. &nbsp;&nbsp;
[Redthoreau]: '''TDogg''', no problems were caused at all, I was simply curious if maybe there was a wiki policy on date listings etc. I also didn't want to revert them, or make any adjustments before speaking with you about it - ''(I'm still not sure what to do to be honest, as I can see the rationale for both ways)''. Additionally, I can empathize with your \""OCD\"" on the matter, as I also possess several \""quirks\"" which irritate me\/enact a response. &nbsp;&nbsp;
[Redthoreau]: '''TDogg''', The vast majority of your wiki'ning of the article has been excellent and is much appreciated. However, I was wondering if you wouldn't mind reverting solely the dates to the Middle endian format. The reasoning being that it was previously decided that since the page was mostly read in America that it should reflect that particular audience. After perusing other similar historical figures English pages, I found most to also use this particular formatting for dates. Thank you. &nbsp;&nbsp;
[Redthoreau]: '''Thanks''' for doing that for me. Also nice work with the continued wiki'n and citations. If you have the time I think a few repeat citations could use formatting, as you seem quite adept at quickly synchronizing them. &nbsp;&nbsp;
[Redthoreau]: '''Mattisse''', I might be one of the last people you want to hear from right now ''(considering our sometimes turbulent past)'' but I wanted to take this opportunity to let you know that despite all that, I still recognize that you provide many useful and helpful services to Wikipedia. We all can get emotional\/impassioned at times ''(lord knows I am guilty)'' and I hope that the RFC ''(of which I had no intention of taking part)'' does not drive you away from the Wiki project for good. Most of us make up a beneficial link in the proverbial Wiki-chain and even though we have had our share of past edit-battles, I recognize that you bring many beneficial attributes to the overall wiki endeavor. It is my hope that this short message serves as a second olive branch ''(the first being my unilateral apology long ago)'' that should we work together in the future, I would hope it is with a fresh slate. Best regards. &nbsp;&nbsp;
[Redthoreau]: '''Mattisse''', I have not said a remotely negative word about you in more than 6 months, and have been more than courteous to you despite our turbulent past. I have gone out of my way to twice unilaterally apologize to you ''(something you still have yet to ever return)'', extend my hand in friendship to you, and send you [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Mattisse&diff=prev&oldid=263081246 encouragement] during your difficult recent RfC tribulations. I purposely chose not to be a part of your RfC because I remained optimistic that you would realize that your abrasive actions, only stain the many valuable things you bring to Wikipedia. [[User:Coppertwig]] for his\/her part has gone even further than I have and continually always deals with you in a respectful manner. Still you insist on casting aspersions against us as some \""courteous cabal\"" who secretly works together in unison to be as friendly to others as we possibly can. You find our commitment ''(and Copper's advice to me)'' on civility to be a threat for some reason, and interpret it as a sinister plot to push POV, or prevent you from editing an article -[[Che Guevara]]-, that Coppertwig has repeatedly invited you to collaborate with us on. Now out of the blue you begin with a unprovoked attack against myself and Copper [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Talk:Che_Guevara&diff=prev&oldid=268416145 1]. I removed this for your own good. Because I believe you are a good person, and I know that you sometimes let your emotions get the best of you ''(as I also do)''. Luckily, I have Copper to remind me when I slip up and get frustrated, however you lack such a safety net, and it unfortunately results in you sporadically showing your anger in situations as mentioned in the RfC. I am not sure what I need to say to implore you to not blemish your full Wiki potential with these continued episodes. The last thing I want is to have you as an enemy, or to see you attacked for your behavior ... however you make this commitment to civility very difficult with such actions as your recent decision to turn an article's talk page into a [[WP:Forum]] to voice your concerns against me and Copper. I will revert this one more time, in the hopes that you will let it be, and take some time to cool off. You and I both know that the result of this will only be more frustration for both of us, and that it will distract us both from our more meaningful tasks of editing articles. Please, take this message to heart and learn to let things go. You literally just posted that you [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Talk:Che_Guevara&diff=prev&oldid=268417930 \""can't breathe\""] because you are so frustrated that Copper and myself ''(do the basic task)'' of responding to messages on the [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Talk:Che_Guevara talk page] of Che Guevara. There is no reason for you to get yourself so worked up about nothing. Thanks. &nbsp;&nbsp;
[Redthoreau]: '''Mattisse''', to specifically answer some of your concerns. I don't view Copper and my communications as \""collusion\"". If it were so, then all collaboration would be. I also am not sure why you define simple talk page comments to me to be liaisons. I wouldn't classify our current discussion as a \""liaison\"", so why is it so when me and Copper do so. I also am not sure how Copper leaving me a message on my talk page is \""covert\"". If anything Copper has my email ''(which I publicly disclose)'' and could easily 'covertly' communicate with me, if that was our intention ... but it is not. In reference to \""whispering\"", I believe that you are misreading Copper's practice of simply placing any critiques\/criticisms in <small>small font.<\/small> It is sort of his\/her modus operandi, and not an attempt to hide or conceal anything ''(as it is still easily readable to all)'' and not a \""code\"" or something. Lastly, it seems that Copper has [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Talk:Che_Guevara&diff=prev&oldid=268465243 reverted] my removal of your talk page comments ... thus '''I am going to politely request that you remove these yourself.''' I feel that such comments will only \""poison the well\"" and reflect poorly on you, as you are far more reasonable than they appear. Moreover, if they remain then I will have to counter your claims with how I disagree with your assessment ''(and blaming me for the article losing FA status)'', and we both know where that will lead and possibly spiral into. So please will you remove those comments yourself? I believe that such an action will go a long way to displaying your commitment to taking some of those RfC comments to heart. There is no reason to feed the unfair stereotypes that you believe you have been painted with. &nbsp;&nbsp;
[Redthoreau]: '''Mattisse''', I don't agree with your analysis that the pages standards have been lowered, but on that issue we will just have to agree to disagree. However, '''I would be more than willing to be your friend :o) , and I appreciate your commitment to \""not hassle me anymore about the Che article\""'''. I believe that such a commitment will be best for both of us in the long run. You add countless things to this wiki project, and I feel that your talents are best used when you are not in confrontation, but rather in adding your wiki knowledge to the hundreds of various articles you like to edit. As for your talk page comments, I will let you decide what to do with those. I don't believe that they help your image, and they aren't exactly a good way to begin a friendship, but if you wish for them to stand as your parting testament, then there isn't much I can do about that. I do understand where you are coming from, and to reiterate will be happy to \""be your friend\"" per your request. Thanks. &nbsp;&nbsp;
[Redthoreau]: '''Thank you Mattisse''' for the barn star of peace. I hope that it will act as a symbolic \u201cnew beginning\u201d to a more harmonious editing relationship between us. My wish is for us to operate with a clean slate towards one another and to leave the past behind. You have many valuable attributes to offer Wikipedia, and it is my desire for us both to no longer be distracted from our main mission ... which is the production of a great encyclopedic resource. In appreciation, &nbsp;&nbsp;
[Redthoreau]: Hello '''Cosmic Latte''', I have noticed your productive editing recently from afar and thus it is nice to meet you. Additionally, through my watch pages I have noticed an ongoing disagreement between you and [[User:Luis Napoles]] on Cuba related topics ''(a subject matter which I heavily edit and deeply interests me as well)''. I have sent a '''[[User talk:Luis Napoles#Response|message]]''' to Luis about many of the issues which I believe you may have also had disagreements with him on. I include it here so that you can possibly add to the discussion, or merely be aware that another editor shares some of your same concerns. It is my hope that a neutral solution can be met, which I [[WP:Assume good faith|believe]]\/hope to be your goal as well. Thanks &nbsp;&nbsp;
[Redthoreau]: '''Cosmic''', as someone involved in editing the [[Fidel Castro]] article, your views on the \""U.S. backed\"" question per the talk page, would be welcome. Thanks &nbsp;&nbsp;
[Redthoreau]: Just so you know, I have mentioned you ---> [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard\/Incidents#Luis.27_POV_edits_speak_for_themselves_-_complaint_.233 Here]. &nbsp;&nbsp;
[Redthoreau]: Hello 3after3, nice to meet you. I have noticed that you have been following my edits the last day or so and removing those external links that I add to articles. Of note these are not my own personal websites, and always belong to reputable news organizations and websites. I am familiar with the unfortunately vague [[Wp:EL]], and thus don't see how many of these clearly violate this policy. If you are the only one that removes those links that I add and not others, then it becomes even more clear that they potentially are not a violation, but perhaps ones that you don't like or part of an overall preference on your part against most EL's to begin with ''(which is your prerogative, but short of an official policy against all EL's it doesn't seem collaborative)''. Additionally, I feel like you should have messaged me about the links if you felt they were in violation ''(could have saved me the time)'', rather than merely shadowing my edits and removing them behind me. You are obviously a veteran wikipedian ''(as I am)'', and I guess that is why I find your lack of letting me know to be out of character for a veteran of the project considering the fact that I am not a troll, vandal, spammer etc. Let me know what you think. &nbsp;&nbsp;
[Redthoreau]: I came across your remarks in reference to Cleon Skousen on the Glenn Beck talk page and agree with your rationale. In the coming days I am going to try to improve and expand Skousen's article and introduce a section on Beck's article in reference to his influence. Your collaboration, assistance, suggestions, and feedback is of course welcome and appreciated if you have the time. Nice to meet you. &nbsp;&nbsp;
[Redthoreau]: I took your advice and have done so on the talk page. &nbsp;&nbsp;
[Redthoreau]: Hey Copper, hope life is well. Just a quick note that I [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Talk:Che_Guevara&diff=prev&oldid=321129952 added] you to a maintained tag on the Che article as you and I are usually the first to respond. If you would rather me remove you, just let me know. As an aside, I miss running into you around the Wiki world :o) - hope you're not to busy. &nbsp;&nbsp;
[Redthoreau]: '''Since you created the article 4 years ago''', I wanted to let you know about the recent proposal. I have added a paragraph of the incident to the relevant article (Che Guevara) and thus deem this one unnecessary and failing general [[WP:Notability]] guidelines.

I wasn't aware of all that had gone down before InShaneee blocked Ardenn, but from the reason given by InShaneee on Ardenn's talk page, it didn't seem like there was real justification to block him\u2014certainly not for a full two days\u2014and that's why I made the comment I did on InShaneee's page. However, I was unaware of some of the earlier things said, including the \""STFU\"" comment noted above (which I actually can't find, but which I assume is somewhere), and I agree that's certainly deserving of a block. I've had my share of problems with Ardenn myself, but I've been trying to help out a bit, knowing that he's also done a lot of good.

[Jondel]: YOUVE STARTED WWIII AND A NUCLEAR REACTION THAT WILL END THE WORLD!!! just kidding.I believe you need to create an acount on the french wikipedia at least once, with the login password and all even if  a 'dummy' user page comes up. The cookies of your computers must be up. If you have created the account once, the interwiki should go that page from the cookies of your PC. I don't want to get involved with the imbroglios at the interlingua page although I'm fascinated with the langauge.I've made some suggestions to be able to achieve a consensus. I don't know if the offical interlingua committee are creating a myth that the language is based on major languages outside of romance. It is romance based and that is why it is good and why I can immediately understand it. Still, it should become popular. I'll vist your page and see what I can do.--
[Jondel]: Yes . Do that first before going there from an interwiki. I placed a delete notice at the other accidental french userpage.  Hmm maybe I should study esparanto anyway, also folkspraak.--

[Jondel]: Enrique . I know that Pigafetta worked on the dictionary with Enrique before they arrived to the Philippines( where is that source again!  ). It was supposed to be the first Italian Malay dictionary but the words were unmistakably old cebuano but recognizable to be visayan(cebuano, many words are similar to ilonggo ). I looked at the second and third links from the university website. Very good for future references but little on the dictionary. Sooner or later   somebody is going to contend or dispute that Enrique is from Cebu. Be the firstest with the bestest (proof).  I'll be checking your fourth link. Merci, encore.  --
[Jondel]: About the usenet thread. This seems to be a debate I already know. The definite, conclusive, undeniable proof is the purported Italian-Malay dictionary of Pigafetta. If the words were old Cebuano, this will establish that Enrique is in fact from Cebu.--

[Jondel]: Wow. Ubi laboras? Cur latine sciunt? Where do you work? How come they know latin?--
[Jondel]: Yes I went back to look at your user page and saw where you work. I work with computers and worked as a programmer for more than a decade.

[Jondel]: I apologize for taking so long to respond. I am reluctant to engage in edit wars. My main concern is neutrality especially in the INC and its rival orgainization. I will see what I can do.--
[Jondel]: The issues are controversial in Philippine society. I was responding to \"" If you feel you yourself are too involved.... \"". A metaphor which might apply here to explain my responce is like, a doctor might not be the best person to operate on his own wife because he might be too emotionaly involved. Hence a third party doctor would be the best to operate. I've set the expiry to a few weeks btw and blocking out only unregistered and totally new users.--

There is no malicious intent and the notice includes 'If you do not want your writing to be edited, used, and redistributed at will, then do not submit it here.' How far does this consensus extend? I will have a look at this consensus. --

Drunkenduncan,False,"[Drunkenduncan]: You have a good point, they did fight all the time. I maybe should have worded it more towards my own belief that the word coalition was only used by the united nations as a pr effort to make the situation sound more stable and legitimate than it really was. The wiki page for the [[Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea]] however supports exactly what I wrote. Would you object if I added my edit back in but with the words \""a coalition of political forces called the [[Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea]] was established with the blessing of the [[United Nations]].\"" changed to \""country was divided up between three factions that the [[United Nations]] euphemistically referred to as [[Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea]]\"" I believe this is fairly accurate and takes your objection into account. I may also look at changing the [[Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea]] page too but that will require more research so I may not get around to it for a while."
{unknown-4375},False,"[{unknown-4375}]: Thanks. I wouldn't even call it a minority opinion. I think his approach more represents the view that events cannot be talked about candidly and honestly, and instead must get dressed up or get a spin job. And of course not only is that contrary to wikipedia, it is just plain obnoxious and detrimental to the dharma. Sylvain1972 13:52, 27 March 2008 (UTC)"
VitaleBaby,False,"[VitaleBaby]: For that fact, I don't have my reference.  I'm trying to think where it came from.  It wasn't from someone's blog or anything like that.  Damn, I just can't remember.  It's from one of those voting websites, something similar to vote smart or voteusa, but I just cannot remember right now.  I'll look and verify that for you when I'm less buzy, ok?
[VitaleBaby]: I was wrong about his first name.  I see what happened though.  I found the voteusa page that I was looking at, and it had Stickland and Ted Kulongoski, who actually is Theodore, listed one after the other.  So I screwed it up.  Interesting that the guy's name is actually Ted though.
[VitaleBaby]: Strange to me that two such prominent sources would have contrasting info. I found it in The Hill at http:\/\/thehill.com\/new-member-guide.html
[VitaleBaby]: While I know that these articles aren't very long, I feel that a less extensive system like Pittsburgh's T is being singled out. For example, many of the stop's on New York's subway that are located outside of Manhattan feature one or two paragraphs of information. If the small suburban T stops must be deleted because they don't serve anything but residences, then the NYC stops that serve residential-only areas in Queens or Brooklyn should be deleted as well. Anyway, I decided to start this page because I'm from the North Hills of Pittsburgh and haven't ridden The T in a long time (its 20 miles away from me). I was going to head out on it to a friend's house which is located off one of these smaller stops, and I couldn't find a lot of info. So if we're helping people to find info quickly, rather than forcing them to scour the internet, I think we're adding to the site.
[VitaleBaby]: Ha, nice error on that one.
[VitaleBaby]: Oh. Forgot about the bridge. Just thought about editing this while riding in on The T a few days ago. Obviously, the entire line was re-done in the 1980s, so I'm sure the reason the name and station were kept were because of the apartments. But yes, the bridge is older.
[VitaleBaby]: I'm not a frequent rider, I generally only use The T to get to sporting events. And because of the backlash to the Port Authority cuts (and the subsequently slight scale back on what the agency planned to eliminate), I'm hoping that all the minor stops stay open. If I can ever get pictures I will, as the street level stops all look very different. For example, many of the ones in Beechview are concerete islands in the street (similar to what they have at minor stops on the Boston MBTA Green Line or the SF Muni Metro), while suburban ones range from low concrete platforms with attached bus shelters to little more than wooden ramps that hold a two-person bench.
[VitaleBaby]: I'm not sure to what you are referring. Truck 653 is a real route. I may not have the street names correct, and I'll refer to my sources to see if I can get some better information. If you're from the area and the route is not signed well, I wouldn't be surprised. PennDot is notorious. Truck 148 in McKeesport was barely signed for decades before they finally got around to improving it.
[VitaleBaby]: It's not incorrect. It comes directly from PennDot. The map of their Somerset County maintenance is at the bottom of the 653 page. I updated the street names based upon their data.
[VitaleBaby]: I've been trying to create some fairly detailed articles about PA gubernatorial elections. However, it's sometimes really hard to find out who was the losing candidate in the lieutenant governor's race. I see that you've added boxes to the pages of some figures that show that they were the nominee to this office and lists the candidates who preceeded\/followed them. Could you tell me where you found this information? Right now, I'm at a loss for finding the 1914, 1926, and 1938 Democratic nominee.
[VitaleBaby]: Thanks for the help. I've found some information that will definitely be useful in future gubernatorial articles. However, I still haven't been able to find the 1926 Democratic nominee for Lieutenant Govenor. If you could help me out, that would be great. I'll bet set to chronicale the governor's races back to the beginning of the 20th Century.
[VitaleBaby]: Messaging you must have been good luck. I tried one last search and figured it out."
Tao of tyler,False,"[Tao of tyler]: I think that it would be wise if you and I refrained from any more debate with eachother over the content of Man vs. Wild.

Matkatamiba,False,"[Matkatamiba]: I assume you are the manager of this page, which means you certainly have the power to determine appropriate links.

I know what I must do now in my future contributions and my bad behaviour won't happen again. (
[Darkness2005]: Yes, that was the reason I was blocked. I didn't actually use the talk page to communicate with other users as well as not using the edit summary as to why I edited the articles. Now I know I have to use the talk page and the edit summary to actually explain why I had to edit an article. (
[Darkness2005]: Can you give me a template example of what it should look like next time I edit the Challenge TV article? (
[Darkness2005]: Oh, yeah. Sorry about that. I got a bit carried away there because I didn't know what you wanted me to do on that article. When I get unblocked soon enough I'll contact you to tell me what you want me to do on the Challenge TV article and maybe give me a template example so that I know what to do next time. OK? (
[Darkness2005]: Thank you for awaring me about that. I've got it memorized in my head. (
[Darkness2005]: Yes, I am willing this time to communicate and engage with other editors on why I'm doing these edits and I am willing to agree with other editors if they don't like any kind of edit change or vandalizim I attempt to do. (
[Darkness2005]: And I'm pretty sure I will start engaging with other editors from now on during edits or vandalism that they won't like from me. (
[Darkness2005]: Yes, that was the case. I got confused what the word ''Vandalize'' meant. Because it's a new word to me. Is there some way to change the word ''Vandalize'' to a word that's more easier and simpler for me to remember? (
[Darkness2005]: Thank you very much. I'm sure I will from now on engage into any discussion if they are concerned by an edit I attempt to do. I'll hopefully contact you or any other editor soon if there's something I'm unsure about. (
[Darkness2005]: I will. I need to test out the edit summary first on a few articles then I'll go over to your Challenge TV article issue. (
[Darkness2005]: No, it wasn't. It was something else.
[Darkness2005]: Hang on a minute. That's not the picture I uploaded on Wikipedia.
[Darkness2005]: As I said before. Do NOT include games in the aggregate review scores that are 2 in 1 (or bundled) because that will be unfair & confusing. NOT hypocritical. Also, the PSP version of FFIV is NOT a compilation.
[Darkness2005]: I'm not talking about the talk page. I'm talking about the review score template."
ErikWarmelink,False,"[ErikWarmelink]: @Tdevries: I think the \""mentor\"" is as guilty of [[COI]] as Guido. The only difference is that the person behind the account of the \""mentor\"" may not be named. You speak Dutch, search [[:nl:Wikipedia:Relevantie]] for which group of teachers at tertiary education are deemed relevant ''per se'' and find out which account added that clause (as a hint: you [http:\/\/nl.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Relevantie\/Muziek&diff=10605602 protected] the subpage with that selfpromotion).
[ErikWarmelink]: In short (and I have to be short, unless I get blocked by \""accident\"" by oscar again, or by his friends from IRC because I violated oscars privacy), oscars profession in real life is the only teaching job which makes the holder of that job \""relevant\"" for nl.wikipedia. Oscar added that clause, Tdevries protected the page. Oscar & friends managed to drive Guido from nl.wiki (in my opinion because anyone with a ''cum laude'' for his\/her thesis is a threat to the pokemon, soccer and television crowd). That was not enough, so the mob started vandalising [[Melody Amber chess tournament]] on en.wiki, because some of the tournement books were written by Guido (and someone on wikipedia who has written books and a thesis instead of making a fancy signature is awfully threatening to their self-esteem). Well, that's not short at all. I guess I will spend less time on nl.wiki.
[ErikWarmelink]: I did read [http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9C05EFDB1F3FF937A35752C0A9659C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all Killing of U.N.

[Theuhohreo]: I would never laugh ''at'' you Jivesh! :p Just like how Rihanna has the \""Rihanna Navy\"" and Lady Gaga has her \""Monsters\"", a group of mega-fans (stans) created the group name \""Bey-Hive\"" for us mega-Beyonce fans! :D It's a play on the word [[beehive]], since Beyonce is the Queen Bey :D. And their is some test online you can take to see what type of \""Bey\"" you are. But i can tell you from now, you are a \""Killer Bey\"" Hahahahaaa! :D
[Theuhohreo]: Hello Nathan! I was wondering if you had time, could you possibly make me a sample for Beyonce's \""[[User:Theuhohreo\/Sandbox|Love on Top]]\""? Preferably towards the end with the constantly changing pitch of Beyonce: 3:55-4:15? Please let me know if this is too much of a hassle and thank you so much for this :]
[Theuhohreo]: Thank you so much! And yes i was, i was one for a whole month :D I just got back last week and now i'm back to making ''4'' articles because the album was amazing! So glad that i waited to hear it because it became the soundtrack to my vacation! Hahahahahaaa! :D
[Theuhohreo]: Yess the sample is absolutely perfect! That part is one of my favorites of the song, so I'm happy critics claimed to like it as well :p. And honestly, with the first listen \""Love on Top\"" and \""Party\"" were my least favorite songs, but by the end of the trip i was hittin them high notes and drippin swagu! I couldn't resist the 80's swag! Hahahahaaa! I completely understand what you mean about taking a few listen to actually get a feel for some songs, cauz in all honesty, if it wasn't Bey singing some of these songs, than I wouldn't be feeling them at all. Although that does sound a little biased, its true lol :p
[Theuhohreo]: Oh yea, and I went to Greece (my family's origination) Hahaha! It was truly amazing! Although Athens was a bit scary because it looked unsafe. Otherwise it was a fun trip with lots of growing and lots of experience and LOTS of Beyonce :P"
Splamo,False,"[Splamo]: Nice picture of the [[MS Prinsendam]]. Love that ship. Thanks for helping improve the article.
[Splamo]: Those are good. I have few pics from my 3 week transatlantic that I'm going to try to work in for a few articles."
EmilJ,False,"[EmilJ]: Yes, I am aware of the rationale for the system in use and I don't see any problem with that, and I'm also aware of the discussion at [[Wikipedia talk:IPA for English]] (though I stopped following it in detail some time ago per tldr).\u2014
[EmilJ]: Your list of fonts suggests that you are probably using Windows, which I'm afraid implies that I won't be able to help you much, because I don't. I also use Firefox and it looks fine, which may indicate that the problem is with fonts rather than the browser, but on the other hand it is quite likely that Firefox relies on different font-rendering libraries on different systems. The default Wikipedia font is sans serif, so that's probably the setting to look into. Anyway, [[WP:Reference desk\/Computing]] may help you more with Windows font issues.\u2014
[EmilJ]: Well, if the same font looks works in IE and not in Firefox, then it is definitely an issue with Firefox (or rather its font-rendering subsystem). Upgrading Firefox may help, if you are using an older version. Other than that, I don't know what can be done about it (no, I'm not going to suggest \""use IE\"").\u2014
[EmilJ]: Before any nonsonorant voiced consonant except \/v\/, just like voice assimilation works for other consonants. It's somewhat rare because of the historical change {{nowrap|[d\u0361z] > [z]}} which more or less ensures that it can only occur before morpheme boundary or in words of foreign origin, but here are some examples (btw, http:\/\/bara.ujc.cas.cz\/psjc\/search.php is quite handy for searching for weird phoneme combinations): ''leckdo'' {{IPA|[\u02c8l\u025bd\u0361z\u0261do]}} (and similar words, like ''leckdy''), ''nanicdobr\xfd'' {{IPA|[\u02c8na\u0272\u026ad\u0361z\u02ccdobri\u02d0]}}, ''salcbursk\xfd'' {{IPA|[\u02c8sald\u0361zburski\u02d0]}}, ''socdem'' {{IPA|[\u02c8sod\u0361zd\u025bm]}}, and of course there is any number of cases like ''noc byla dlouh\xe1'' {{IPA|[\u02c8nod\u0361zb\u026ala\u02c8dlo\u0361u\u0266a\u02d0]}}.\u2014
[EmilJ]: OK, thanks.\u2014
[EmilJ]: The publication year was all right until you touched it, there was no need to change the source in the first place. In other words, what you present as \""make that happen\"" actually means that you fixed problems introduced by yourself. On a related note, I have no idea why you changed the publication year to 1957, but it is wrong. The paper was only published in 1959. One would thought that it is obvious that proceedings for a conference which only ended in 1958 could not possibly be published in 1957.\u2014
[EmilJ]: First, I have corrected the width and height attributes: units have to be written immediately after their numeral, with no intervening space. Second, I factored out common presentation attributes of all the circles: that is, I grouped them together in a <g> element styled with the relevant attributes (fill, stroke, stroke-width), then these attributes do not have to be repeated for each circle as they are inherited from their parent (<g>) element. I think that it should be fairly obvious from the source.\u2014
[EmilJ]: Validators tend to be very strict about XML\/SGML syntax rules, but often less so about things like permissible attribute values (because these have to be checked by ad hoc rules, whereas there are plenty of ready-made generic XML parsers available where one just drops the SVG DTD).\u2014
[EmilJ]: You're welcome.\u2014
[EmilJ]: OK, thanks.\u2014
[EmilJ]: \""Induced\"" is a word used a lot in different ways in various contexts, often even informally, and as such it is quite ambiguous. I don't recall seeing it used for the concept you describe, but I guess it could be a sensible name for the property, as long as you define it before use. I don't think the property has any widely recognized name. As a noun, however, \""induction\"" is a very bad choice, as this word universally refers to [[mathematical induction|induction]] in mathematics (and in logic in particular); if you really need a verbal noun to go with \""induced\"", you'd be better off with \""inducing\"", even though it does not ring so good.\u2014
[EmilJ]: The first one sounds reasonable. I don't quite understand what you mean in the second one, but it sounds too complicated for the problem at hand.\u2014
[EmilJ]: What remains is to write (*) as a <math>\\Sigma^2_1<\/math> formula. Since all three types have definable pairing functions, we can use quantifiers for binary, ternary, etc., relations instead of just subsets. Thus we can start with an existential third-order quantifier for a binary relation < on '''R'''. We can say that < is a linear order with a bunch of quantifiers over '''R''' (i.e., second-order in our setting) just by stating the usual axioms. Then we state that \""for every a in '''R''', the initial segment {x in '''R'''|x < a} is countable\"". The last part is slightly tricky and I'm not going to write it down explicitly, but the point is that we can encode a function '''N''' \u2192 '''R''' (= P('''N''')) by a subset of '''N''' \xd7 '''N''' (and therefore by a real).\u2014
[EmilJ]: I don't see a problem, the model will be a two-sorted structure with one sort for reals, one sort for continuous real functions, an application operation, and whatever other predicates or operations are used in <math>\\varphi<\/math>. This is pretty much a [[second-order logic#Semantics|Henkin model]] for second-order logic (except that it involves functions rather than subsets).\u2014
[EmilJ]: #OK, maybe I shouldn't have used the word in an edit summary, but if a user edits an article, sees a large boilerplate notice telling him\/her not to do something, ignores it, and does exactly what the notice is telling them not to do (without any explanation either in edit summary or on the talk page), then in my book he\/she is either ignorant or acting in bad faith.\u2014
[EmilJ]: You are welcome.\u2014

[EmilJ]: \u2014
[EmilJ]: Last time I checked, there were about half dozen such templates, and a brief look at their talk page made it clear that they were broken in one browser or another (only each of them in a different way). Are you really sure that the current incarnation of {{tl2|su}} is cross-browser compatible?\u2014
[EmilJ]: As a matter of fact, I can already see that your change to the article is broken in ''my'' browser: in \""Conservative over RCA_0 for \u03a0{{su|p=1|b=1}} sentences\"" in the table, there is a line break between \u03a0 and {{su|p=1|b=1}}.\u2014
[EmilJ]: The line break ''is'' a problem of the template, because plain <nowiki>X<sup>a<\/sup><sub>b<\/sub><\/nowiki> does not break. But that is a minor problem. The real problem is whether it actually works reliably in browsers ''other'' than Firefox, which you did not demonstrate. The template produces ''much'' more complicated code than the simple hack I used. The actual choice is between a complicated template which tries to be clever to align things automatically and may be broken in some browsers (and I mean ''totally'' broken, such as making the superscripts display on a line of their own far away from the base text), and a simple and robust CSS which relies on a manually adjustable and somewhat font-dependent shift (and therefore tends to be off a bit). I am perfectly aware that it is an unelegant hack, but the only reason I'm using it is that I have not yet seen a better reliable solution.\u2014
[EmilJ]: The paragraph you quote is irrelevant, it only describes the practice when writing small numbers in everyday language, not mathematical conventions when writing long decimal fractions. The relevant guideline is  [[MOS:NUM#Delimiting (grouping of digits)]]. To give you an idea of the actual usage, a search for 90 digits of pi [http:\/\/www.google.com\/search?hl=en&q=%223.14159+26535+89793+23846+26433+83279+50288+41971+69399+37510+58209+74944+59230+78164+06286+20899+86280+34825%22&btnG=Search in groups of 5] gets ~189,000 hits, whereas the same [http:\/\/www.google.com\/search?hl=en&q=%223.141+592+653+589+793+238+462+643+383+279+502+884+197+169+399+375+105+820+974+944+592+307+816+406+286+208+998+628+034+825%22&btnG=Search in groups of 3] gets 231 hits (YMMV, but not by several orders of magnitude).\u2014

[EmilJ]: I have no idea, since I didn't read Franzen. I was going to add a source for the second incompleteness theorem for Q, but I didn't get to do it yet.\u2014
[EmilJ]: OK. BTW, Pudl\xe1k's theorem (the one referring to ordinary provability, not to restricted provability) can be further generalized by using arbitrary relative interpretations instead of cuts, giving this neat formulation: if ''T'' is a consistent theory [not necessarily in arithmetical language, and not necessarily extending any given base theory] and \u03c4 is a \u03a3<sub>1<\/sub>-formula defining an axiom set for ''T'' in '''N''', then ''T'' cannot interpret Q + Con<sub>\u03c4<\/sub>. The interpretability logic people use this version. Unfortunately they seem to treat it as a sort of folklore, so I'm not sure whether one can find a good source for the statement (for example, here[http:\/\/www.phil.uu.nl\/preprints\/preprints\/PREPRINTS\/preprint267.pdf] it's simply attributed to Pudl\xe1k's 1985 paper).\u2014

But he vandalized the talk page, posting the his version of the article there and deleteing discussion, more than 5 times, and he has vandalized again, soon after you removed the Sprotect.  Multiple admins have locked the page, all I ask is that the next time an admin Sprotects the page, will you please allow the Sprotect to stand for a couple of days (I won't be the one to ask an admin to, so it will likely be an impartial decision)?

[RobinHood70]: Hi Ward.  In your recent changes to the CFS article, there's one minor anomaly that's cropped up in the [[Chronic_fatigue_syndrome#Naming]] section:  it now reads that \""A review in 1999 explained ...\"" followed by \""For this reason, a 1996 report ... recommended ...\"".  Ummm...were they time travelling? ;)  Wasn't sure what you had intended there, so I thought I'd just bring it to your attention and let you fix it. \u2014
[RobinHood70]: Looks better now. \u2014
[RobinHood70]: That's all I did and I got it within moments of requesting it yesterday.  I hadn't yet had a chance to go through it, though.  If you don't get it, drop me a private e-mail and I'll send it to you. \u2014
[RobinHood70]: Hey Ward. I think this was probably originally moved due to the bias it gave the article with the House reference, but I thought I'd let you know in case it was something you thought should be kept. \u2014
[RobinHood70]: In addition to Ward20's points, the other reason that your conciliatory statement is inappropriate and potentially offensive is that it makes a boat-load of assumptions about the motivations of the CFS community and, as Ward20 said, implies that those are his motivations as well. To cover the broader scope, however: while many in the CFS community have high hopes that XMRV will turn out to be the causative agent, many others are much more cautious and don't attribute CFS to any single cause, nor would they consider XMRV to be a \""favored hypothesis\"". Furthermore, as has already been discussed, that hypothesis, while certainly in dispute, is far from disproven. Finally, at this point, very few people in the CFS community could be described as \""disappointed\"", as most of those who support the theory have noted numerous flaws in the contamination-related research and are awaiting more definitive results from other researchers. <span style=\""white-space:nowrap\"">\u2013

[RobinHood70]: Can you explain why you restored the parameters to {{tl|London Gazette}} in {{Diff|Template:London_Gazette|436462831|436421093|this edit}}? They're deprecated and there are no instances of calls to London Gazette that use these parameters any more, so why keep them around? <span style=\""white-space:nowrap\"">\u2013
[RobinHood70]: I have a non-editing bot that I used to check, and none of those parameters are used on any calls any more. Mind you, I may keep you logic and simply change the parameters, as there are a couple of parameters like <code>linkeddate<\/code> and <code>notarchive<\/code> that are deprecated, but still in use. <span style=\""white-space:nowrap\"">\u2013
[RobinHood70]: Okay, I'll revert then. Based on the documentation for the category, I gather it's only supposed to be used for certain parameter names at the moment, so I'll just do a revert for now; we can reinstate it with different parameters if the scope of that category expands later on. <span style=\""white-space:nowrap\"">\u2013

Please dont put the yellw map on the Moncton page, Thank you

[Stu pendousmat]: Hey, well I suppose if you are going to re-direct all of them due to a policy about notability that makes more sense. To me it looked like you were singling out the SX10. I thought it was kinda nice to have it, as most SLR cameras have an article and the powershot model line of \""bridge cameras\"" are close to SLR level. I'm fine with the redirect if its an across the board type thing, just maybe take the pictures into the other article as each of these cams have a picture. Have a good one!"

[Osndok]: Because range voting allows voters to rank candidates equal (or express no opinion at all!), therefore in the theoretical\/strictest sense range voting '''cannot ever guarantee''' \""a unique and complete ranking\"" (required for arrow's theorem). This is true even with one voter, and is IMHO the quintessential difference between the theory and practice of voting systems (single-voter \/ ties). Also why 'majority defeat disqualifier' (and other rank-with-equal-option voting systems \""fail\"" arrow's theorem). Cheers. --"

If you would like to check, [[The Cheetah Girls 3]] has more than one reference, ''and'' an IMDB page, which I just added to [[The Cheetah Girls 3]] page.

Vampire Warrior II,False,"[Vampire Warrior II]: I was recommended by another user to come talk to you. I am wondering if it'd be possible to have my original account, [[User:Vampire Warrior|Vampire Warrior]] unblocked. If I may, I can clear up a few things. The suicide note, as I've stated was my way of ditching the stalker. The police did show up to my house after tracking my IP and I explained it all to them. As for [[User:ImmortalKaine|ImmortalKaine]], he isn't a sockpuppet, persay, but an old account of mine. I forgot the password to the account and I don't remember the email I used. So I was wondering if I can get Vampire Warrior unblocked and I can move my userpages over to his name myself (if that's possible). I've taken some time to cool down. It's been about 4+ months since I was last here. I'm also on new meds so I'm much calmer, etc. Thanks for a speedy reply!
[Vampire Warrior II]: Excuse me? I took a couple months away from Wiki to cool down. I ain't here to create some damn soap opera. And yes, I would unblock me. There are alot of people WORSE than me.
[Vampire Warrior II]: It is impossible to name the many IP addresses that vandalize every day. If memory serves me correct, there was a certain member who used usernames with \""Candice Michelle\"" in the name who persistently kept adding week-by-week synopsis' into Candice Michelle's article. After he\/she was blocked, he\/she came back several more times under varying nicknames, usually involving WWE or Candice Michelle and frequently attempted to add back the information. That one's off the top of my head, as I dealt with him\/her and I think...but I'm not sure...that you dealt with him\/her as well. CANDICEMICHELLEFAN was his or her name, if memory serves me correct.
[Vampire Warrior II]: Look, I've admitted the suicide note to throw the guy off was a mistake. I explained it all to the police officer and he assured me he'd be watching the guy. Haven't heard from the stalker since. Also, they didn't risk their privacy. You can remain anonymous. You dwell on the past too much. That is why you fail. Also, apples and oranges? Where?
[Vampire Warrior II]: There's a problem with that. Mass community things normally don't go well. Not many people know me, and as such, will be inclined to go with the crowd and possibly give negative comments. That's why I don't like community-based stuff. I've changed. I'm no longer the immature fool you once knew. If you'll excuse me, I must go shower. I'm going out for dinner tonight.
[Vampire Warrior II]: I have returned. Oh, and thanks Wknight, for removing that administrator template x] I forgot about that. See, I used Dfrg.msc's user page template (he gave me permission on Vampire Warrior). I forgot to change a few things over."

Qwerta369,False,"[Qwerta369]: I'm afraid I think it is certainly vandalism, since fact is being replaced with fiction and this has been pointed out repeatedly and in depth. Please refer to the Talk Page on [[John Rocha]] if you wish.
[Qwerta369]: Well then, respectfully, you should see that Rocha is not Irish, no?  One doesn't gain a nationality simply by living in a country for a long time.  I don't quite fathom why this is so hard for people to comprehend.
[Qwerta369]: I'm sorry to tell you, but you're quite wrong.  I don't have any agenda and I do not delete references because I do not agree with them.  You call them references, but none of those in question refer to Rocha to be an Irish citizen and if they did they would be incorrect since Rocha has at no point naturalised as so.  Please do not attempt to bully me.
[Qwerta369]: I don't think that is your call to make, NorthernCounties.  If Wikipedia is a credible encyclopaedia, it cannot contain untrue statements.  In reply to RashersTierney, Irish nationality has not been awarded to John Rocha.  He is not an Irish national and has never claimed to be.  Rocha is resident in the state of Ireland and is eligible to apply for Irish nationality based on his length of residence in Ireland and\/or on his marriage to an Irish national, but until an application is made and is subsequently granted, John Rocha is not and does not claim to be an Irish national."

[Bearian]: After being warned '''several times''', an editor using a certain IP address is continuing to spam other articles.  The diff evidence is here: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=American_Youth_Hostels&diff=152881145&oldid=151475372].  It is spam because the backpackers hostels are proprietary, for-profit competitors to the not-for-profit [[American Youth Hostels]].  Can you ''please'' block that address?  BTW, I am a member of American Youth Hostels, and a former volunteer of the year, if that matters for [[WP:COIN|COI purposes]].  I don't have a \""mop\"" yet.

[Bearian]: I moved it per your suggestion, and sent it to [[Template_talk:Did_you_know#Articles_created.2Fexpanded_on_October_26]].
[Bearian]: I cropped your added comments per [[WP:UNDUE]] - you gave too much undue weight to the defamatory accusations.  \""Can't we all just get along?\""
[Bearian]: I [[WP:AGF|assumed good faith]], but overenthusiasism is a fault many of us share.
[Bearian]: It took me a few clicks on the [[Arkansas Secretary of State]]'s website to find the information we needed.  I sourced it and removed your prod.  Just because it's not on Google doesn't mean it's not verifiable. It needs updating.  Can you please do that?
[Bearian]: Wow, thank you for the barnstar!
[Bearian]: I have been working on this with an expert in the field to fix this article.  Do you think we are making progress?
[Bearian]: Well, I found at least one textbook (a secondary source) on the topic by J. Rose, and have discovered some pre-2003 primary sources.  I am still working on it.  I am an eventualist.
[Bearian]: I like your suggestion of smerging some material from [[History of the Constitution of the Roman Republic#From the Gracchi to Caesar (133\u201349 BC)]] along with its footnotes.  However, I feel a fit insecure about '''how''' to do that while preserving attribution.  Can you please do it, Obi Wan Mandsford?  You are my only hope....  I'll cut and past the images for now.
[Bearian]: I'm going to take a crack at it this weekend.  Please revert me if I screw up.
[Bearian]: Hi, sorry to bother you again, but I think guy is notable.  His entire family is notable (two have been long-time [[Harlem]] politicians), and he frequently appears in NYC area papers and other media.  He's [[WP:BARE|notable enough]] in his own right as an engineer.  While [[WP:UGLY|clearly a mess]], the article [[WP:BEFORE|can be fixed before it is deleted]].  The deletion of this without very clear consensus will likely cause bad publicity to Wikimedia.  Please give me a few weeks to work on it, and then it can go to [[WP:AfD]] if you still feels it must be deleted.
[Bearian]: Thank you for the tea and biscuits....  I removed your ProD, because parents of [[United States]] Presidents are usually, but not always, considered notable.  This particular article has a [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=John_Adams,_Sr&action=history history] of edit-warring and vandalism.  [[WP:OUTCOMES|Past outcomes]] at [[WP:AfD]] have gone various ways, but most often a '''keep'''.  Category:Proposed deletion is only for ''non-controversial'' deletions.  This man in particular has had whole chapters of major treatises and award-winning popular biographies written about him.  I will work on it ASAP.  I protected it in the meanwhile from further damage. Thank you in adavnce for your patience.
[Bearian]: I've added information and citations, notably several books.  His home is now a National Park.  I think that makes him [[WP:GNG|notable]].
[Bearian]: Regarding [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Crisis_of_the_Roman_Republic&diff=415036128&oldid=414027083 your edit], yes, that's what I thought I read.  I may have misspelled it, and have since returned the book to the library.
[Bearian]: What part of \""Feel free to edit the article, but the article must not be blanked, and this notice must not be removed, until the discussion is closed. For more information, particularly on merging or moving ...\"" do you not understand?  You are [[WP:BITE|not a noobie]], and should know better.  Further such obnoxious moves shall result in your being blocked.
[Bearian]: No problem.  One must use a \""templated reason\"" for protection, and that was the closest of those offered.
[Bearian]: Thank you for the C-rating. I am trying to get it up to a GA.

[Bearian]: This was the fictional town in [[Tarantula_(film)#Production]].  LOL.  I am re-directing it instead.
[Bearian]: Very interesting article!
[Bearian]: You semi-protected this article.  I want to un-protect [[Donald Trump]], so that uninvolved and anonymous IPs can edit this, which is FUBAR.  If IP vandalism returns, we can revert that and semi-protect it again.  May I do that?
[Bearian]: What's going on here?

[Bearian]: Hi, either my computer at work or the en.WP database has a glitch.  It won't let me vote.  Do I have to disable cookies?  What is trhe correct site out of en.WP?
[Bearian]: Oh, dear.  It appears that the polls closed before I could vote!
[Bearian]: Sure, but I expect to be too busy to do a lot of serious editing until after July 5th.
[Bearian]: I removed your prod, but on second thought, he's [[WP:BARE|really only barely notable]].  Do you want to send this to AfD?
[Bearian]: I've removed your prod for the official reason that he was the vice-provost of a university, which is a fairly high-up academic office.  On a more P.C. level, any proposed deletion of any member of the infamous Clayton family is likely to be controversial.  [[WP:AfD]] is the place for such discussions.

[Bearian]: If you are indeed Nelson Antonio Denis, then the answer is, \""No,\"" because your only activities on this project appear to have been to violate [[WP:BLP]], [[WP:SOCK]], and [[WP:COI]], in an effort to harass Adam Clayton Powell IV online.  Wikipedia does not countenance such crimes, and for that reason, the indef block was reasonable and necessary. I met the former member of the assembly once, but have no other relationship with any one of the five Adam Clayton Powells.  A few of the students at my college had interned for him.
[Bearian]: Please do not press the issue, and don't make veiled threats.  Your record, off-wiki and on-wiki, are unflattering, to say the least.  I can't trust you, and it is clear from your past actions in public and here at the project that you don't seem to have any scruples.
[Bearian]: You are welcome.  I again respectfully decline the request, due to Mr. Denis' repeatedly breaking the rules here, as well as his public, off-wiki behavior. His promises are not credible.
[Bearian]: I did a search and found that it's a \""parish\"" in Queensland.

[Bearian]: I don't know how to do as you request, but see [[User:ColderPalace1925\/Kung Fu Panda 3]] if that helps.  The problem is that it's been deleted and re-created 2x, and I don't know if I can do the technical finesse that you may need.   Try [[Wikipedia:Help]] if it's not what you need.
[Bearian]: Oh, just that it ''looks obvious'' to the subject, Ronald Fedkiw, that someone was trying to make trouble for him by making it appear that he's claiming credit for other peoples' work.  That's the gist of what his email was to me.  It's ''not'' so obvious to me, but according to my students, I'm clueless.
[Bearian]: [[User:Bearian\/Deletions|I hate to delete articles, and only do so when obligated]].  The admin system in the deletion process allows for a drop-down box with a few possible rationales for delation, but not a lot of space for explanation, so I am contrained to make short-cuts in my explanation and often thus it comes out harsh.  Whether my opinion agrees with the sentiment of the consensus is besides the point. In this case, my politeness in the afd was meant to mitigate whatever harshness appears in the deletion log.  Miss Manners says to keep angry statements out of public earshot, but euphemisms are always acceptable in public. If you want to re-create a substantially different article, you may.

HHermans,False,"[HHermans]: Hi. Thanks for the work you've done on the article [[Battle of Drakenburg]]. I wrote most of the information about the [[Augsburg Interim]] and the [[Schmalkaldic League]]. From what I've read, the Augsburg Interim was forced onto the Protestants by Charles V, who, having won the Schmalkaldic War, was in control but nevertheless tired of war. If this is true, did the battle, a protestant victory, have any real significance in the course of German history (I can't find anything on google books about this battle, which makes this hard)? Did they have more political control after the battle had been fought or were they still afraid of the Catholic emperor as the article \""Augsburg Interim\"" suggests?"

TerriersFan,True,"[TerriersFan]: This article is full of old photos that promote a musty, stuffy and old fashioned image of the game. It is desperately in need of some modern images. Consequently, I am concerned at your removal of the 'Young and old' image. I am reinserting it since IMHO it benefits the article. If you still object then please make the point on the talk page and see if you get consensus. Unilaterally removing material without talk page discussion is an inappropriate way forward. You raise a valid point about it not being suitable to the lead para so I have dropped it down the article. However, I do not have an 'agenda'. One of the appeals of chess is that enables competition across the generations and can be played by the very young and the very old; this is a factual and valid point to make.
[TerriersFan]: Hi, thank you for your continuing interest in school articles. The article  [[Preston High School (West Virginia)]] has been completely rewritten, removing the directory information to which you rightly objected, and replacing it with sourced, encyclopaedic material including sourcing it as a [[Blue Ribbon Schools Program|Blue Ribbon school]]. Perhaps you would take another look at the article, please?
[TerriersFan]: Thank you.
[TerriersFan]: Hi, I fully understand your delete recommendation at [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\/Crispus Attucks Communication and Writing Magnet School]] because the page was in bad shape. However, it has now been rewritten with many references to establish compliance with [[WP:N]]. I wonder if you would be good enough to revisit your recommendation, please?
[TerriersFan]: Many thanks for your reconsideration.
[TerriersFan]: Hi, thank you for closing this AfD. However, for the system to recognise that it has been closed the (afdtop) template needs to go above the heading. I have fixed it. HTH.
[TerriersFan]: Just a reminder that you need to complete an (oldafdfull) template.

[TerriersFan]: Hi, just a heads up. I fully agree with you declining a speedy. However, it was a G4, [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\/Adilson Melo]] refers. HTH.
[TerriersFan]: Hi, User:Deathardath seems to have done a useful job of identifying Blue Ribbon schools. However, you have undone several apparently accurate edits, for example, [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=University_High_School_(Tucson)&diff=prev&oldid=250113374], [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Evergreen_High_School_(Evergreen,_Colorado)&diff=prev&oldid=250115099] and others. Before I revert the edits, I wonder if there is something that I have missed, please?
[TerriersFan]: Please do not delete useful content. Education was a major omission from this page and the way forward is to list all the schools not to delete the first that has been added.
[TerriersFan]: Hi, I think that you do a fantastic job on DELSORT. However, I was just wondering if, when you add to Schools, whether you would be good enough to add them to the appropriate section, please?
[TerriersFan]: OK, thx for the explanation - pl carry on as before :-)
[TerriersFan]: Hi, I would respectfully ask you to reconsider this close. A redirect, rather than a merge, is effectively a deletion. Your view may be that the list is useless but that was not the consensus of the discussion. Probably a 'no consensus' may have been the most accurate close.
[TerriersFan]: The problem with that is that it is highly unlikely that an editor will compile a comprehensive list from scratch. In general they need a basis to start from which is why we have stubs. I agree that this list, at present has little utility, but if left it will, hopefully grow and, when large enough, can be split into more definitive sub-lists.
[TerriersFan]: Hi, will you please take a second look at this close? I identified a number of references that would meet the sourcing concern. Even the nominator acknowledged that they were sufficient to support a stub after the unencyclopaedic list of successes was removed. The only other contributor simply failed to address the sources that I found and made a generalised statement without considering the pros and cons of the notability of ''this'' group of people. I think that this should have been a 'no consensus' at worst.
[TerriersFan]: I am staggered by your decision to speedy delete this page. Firstly, schools are specifically exempted from A7 deletions. Secondly, pages kept at AfD should not be speedied. If there are spam\/BLP issues then these should be fixed by editing. I am prepared to undelete this page but would rather you did so. The way forward is to take the page to DRV or back to AfD if, after editing, you continue to be concerned over notability.

[TerriersFan]: The way forward is to to produce a new article, in your user space, which shows that this club has had substantial editorial coverage in reliable sources. [[WP:ORG]] and [[WP:CITE]] refer. I should then be delighted to reinstate the page.
[TerriersFan]: Done.
[TerriersFan]: Certainly would be pleased with sight of this.
[TerriersFan]: An interesting point that I have not considered. However, I do not regard a redirect as a deletion since it can be undone as an editorial action. The problem is that if prods are allowed to expire and get deleted then they disappear from sight. I continue to think that redirecting, merging content where possible,is the most pragmatic way forward. It also allows any editor who thinks that a standalone page is justifed, to undo it.
[TerriersFan]: To whom do I send the bill? :-)
[TerriersFan]: Been away but assessed now.
[TerriersFan]: Nice work, thank you.
[TerriersFan]: Thanks; I'll have a look at it.
[TerriersFan]: No, I didn't. I deleted the redirect [[Israel shreve]] which was the incorrect initial capitalisation. I have no interest in the article itself.
[TerriersFan]: I should be happy to support that.
[TerriersFan]: Thanks.
[TerriersFan]: Hi, just got back after a long Wikibreak and am picking things up again.  BTW I was surprised to see [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\/Sightings of Madeleine McCann]].
[TerriersFan]: That site is not, of course, a reliable source. However, it does provide a basis for further exploration. The way forward would be to carry out a Google search on the establishments listed coupled with some of the incidents\/accusations to see if you can find reliable coverage that can then be added to the page.
[TerriersFan]: I have placed my views at [[Talk:Freddie and the Dreamers#Edit warring]] where future discussion should best take place.
[TerriersFan]: Blanking the talk page is normal for blocked vandalism-only accounts when review is improbable. In less clear cases then the procedure you describe is better. In any case, the history remains available for interested editors.
[TerriersFan]: Thank you. I did wonder because he displayed an advanced view on policy that was unusual for a new user!!
[TerriersFan]: Any suggestion on the way forward, please? The page needs to be unprotected at some point but, at the moment, unprotection is likely to result in a resumption of the edit warring.
[TerriersFan]: I have had a look at this. He now appears to have accepted your 'Sun' edit. In truth I don't think the other issues are worth arguing about so my suggestion is just to leave things be.
[TerriersFan]: Ask the closing admin for a detailed justification and then possibly take it to [[WP:DRV]]?
[TerriersFan]: If the answers are not satisfactory then you can go to [[WP:DRV]].
[TerriersFan]: As an Administrator I can assure you that there would be zero chance of your beng blocked by going to DRV nor would the closing admin be offended  - this is just a normal procss. The only caveat I would make is that the procedure requires that you politely ask the closing admin to reconsider, with reasons, first. If the DRV overturned the decision as 'keep' there would not be an immediate AFD; and if there was it would be speedilly closed. HTH.
[TerriersFan]: I don't know either. Since 'merge' is a flavour of 'keep' the balance of views were clearly against deletion. There were no strong arguments for deletion either. The case against merging is that none of the content was sourced but that could have been easily fixed.
[TerriersFan]: I am in the process of expanding the article. Please stop your disruptive redirects.
[TerriersFan]: You have not been accused of a 3RR violation you have been warned to be careful not to violate. I have reverted your redirect twice which is permissible; you have redirected 3 times which is the limit.
[TerriersFan]: Done.
[TerriersFan]: Thank you for these points but I'm away from my machine until tomorrow late evening when I'll reply.
[TerriersFan]: Prods are for uncontroversial deletions - see [[WP:PROD]]. Settlements whose existence is problematic are not uncontroversial. The appropriate way forward is to list them at AFD which gets the broadest range of views.
[TerriersFan]: Now at [[User:TJRC\/The Jadu]].
[TerriersFan]: I have closed the MFD for you. As you will see from the section above the user concerned requested userfication of the article to enable him to improve it. This is accepted practice provided that the article only remains in user space for such period as is reasonable for the page to be developed. I suggest that you watch the new page, and assess the version that is moved back to article space, and take it to AFD if you remain of the opinion that the subject fails the notability guidelines. HTH.
[TerriersFan]: As you will see from [[WP:PROD]], one of the conditions that admins check before deletion is \""No objections have been raised on the talk page.\"" When, as here, there is an objection then the Prod must be declined. HTH.
[TerriersFan]: It was made after the speedy deletion was replaced by a Prod and we cut inexperienced editors slack in not understanding our procedures. It was clear that he didn't want the page deleted and that's sufficient to make it not 'uncontentious'.
[TerriersFan]: Oops! I stand corrected, thanks.
[TerriersFan]: I have restored the article and moved it to [[User:Modify\/BladeLogic]] to enable you to work on it. In addition to a rewrite, it needs substantial new references before being moved back to article space. Please note that it cannot remain in user space indefinitely, but only while you are developing it, so please let me know if you decide not to fix it.
[TerriersFan]: Hi, I have moved it to [[User:Cosmin Unguru\/BatchPhoto]] to enable you to develop it. Useful guidance is contained at [[Wikipedia:Your first article]]. This page cannot remain in user space indefinitely but only while you develop it. Before the article is moved back to article space you need to find independent reviews to support its notability.

Since Prods involve deletion without consensus they should be reserved for the most clear-cut cases. HTH.

[TerriersFan]: Hi, Click the 'Move' button; the new title should be: Ebbeny Faranda; uncheck 'Leave a redirect behind'. However, the page simply is not referenced well enough; if you move it across in its present state then there will have to be  deletion discussion. All the keys facts need independent sources. In addition [[WP:Reliable sources|reliable sources]] need to describe her work directly and in detail. YouTube clips do not constitute reliable sources. See [[WP:Cite]] and [[WP:BIO]].

[TerriersFan]: Hi, I deleted the page because it was an expired [[WP:PROD|Prod]] that had been in place for 7 days. The concern about the page was that, though it made several bold claims about Pryor, none of the material was backed up by independent [[WP:Reliable|reliable sources]]. The page was tagged as needing such sources nearly 4 years ago but no substantive improvement has been made to the sourcing in that time. What we are looking for is coverage of Pryor in reputable, independent publications (not blogs, user websites etc) that back up each of the key pieces of information about her and, ideally, an indepth profile.  Good guidance is contained at [[WP:BIO]]. If you wish to try to improve the page I will userfy it to an account to enable you to work on it. Finally, though, you also need to be aware of [[WP:COI]].

[TerriersFan]: Thank you.
[TerriersFan]: Thank you.
[TerriersFan]: As shown on the talk page, a prod was previously declined. Consequently it cannot be reprodded; see [[WP:PROD]]. Naturally, you may take the page to AfD if you wish.
[TerriersFan]: The sourcing is better but I think that notability is still borderline. [[WP:NPOV]] also needs to be considered; it would help if any criticisms of the software could be sourced. Meanwhile I have sought the advice of [[User:RadioFan]] who attached the original Prod.
[TerriersFan]: Hi, I notice that your have moved pages back to this category. [[:Category:Taxicabs of India]] fits in with the style of all other country-related taxicab articles and I see no reason why India should be different. Do you have any good reason to oppose this change?
[TerriersFan]: Hi, this image has a #15 in the top left corner. Before I take it out I thought that I better check that it is not significant! (The uploader is blocked so cannot be consulted). Best wishes.
[TerriersFan]: My offer of a compromise is that if you will row back from knocking the de facto notability of high schools, I will support you in getting deleted such schools as home schools, tiny private all-though schools for which we know reliable sources won't exist. That way we can both concentrate our efforts in doing some of the much-needed work of article writing and improvement.
[TerriersFan]: It may look like ageism but in fact it's not. Sure high schools have older students but that's not the prime issue. High schools are considered to affect the future lives of their students in the way that elementary schools do not; they tend to be cited by notable people as an influence on their careers; and high schools are major institutions in their local community. The problem with the middle school article in question is that you hadn't added and woven the sources into the article. Had you done that then it might well have been kept. Indeed it is not too late; if you would like to develop it I will userfy it to you and I will help you source it up. The bottom line is that I am spending valuable time continuously debating the same issue with you in various forums. If you row back from doing this I will have the time to help you keep some elementary and middle schools; I have much expertise and experience in successfully getting them through AfD; it is not though a matter of voting keep, it is a matter of sourcing them up and I am happy to assist in this if you will accept my olive branch.
[TerriersFan]: Just an editing point; this page, because of its subject matter, needs to be written in British English. A number of terms e.g. 'offenses' and 'withing' are possible US spellings? Keep up the good work."

Rrius,False,"[Rrius]: Some time ago, you added links for party IDs for members of various Congresses. I honestly don't care either way about having the links, but your edits also put the party IDs in italics, which makes no sense. In other words, you changed \""[[Robert Dole]] (R)\"" to \""[[Robert Dole]] ''([[Republican Party (United States)|R]])''\"", when it should be \""[[Robert Dole]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]])\"". I don't know how to change these other than going Congress by Congress, copying and pasting into Notepad, finding and replacing (once for Rs and once for Ds), and copying and pasting back. I see you used AWB, a tool I know nothing about. Would it be possible for you to go back and de-italicise? Otherwise, I may just revert you edit. It just means more to have the IDs look right than to have 535+ links to the parties per page. Thanks. -
[Rrius]: On some level I just don't get that. I guess my question would be, consistency with what? The italics version is weird and is harder to read. There are many older Congresses that do not use italics (links for that matter), so I don't see where this is controversial enough to bring up for community discussion. I was hoping you would help, but if you won't, then I'll just have to figure out whether to continue on the tedious cut-and-paste method or just revert your edits. The difference is preservation of the linked \""D\"" and \""R\"" labels. Those are also not consistent across the articles, so I don't think that matters either way. -
[Rrius]: The are kind of spread out. I looked at one of the first ten Congresses, and it used linked initials without italics. The ones in Congress in the 80 range do the same. The ones in the 60 range use linked, italicised abbreviations, i.e., \""''([[Republican Party (United States)|Rep.]])''\"". The 110th and 111th do not use italics or links. I don't actually see the point of linking the party for each person, especially since the parties are linked in multiple other places in the articles. Either way, it is silly enough to put the initial (or abbreviation) in italics, but the implementation italicises the parentheses as well. The point of italics is to set the text apart from the rest of the text, but the parentheses do that for the for the initials. As such, the italics is superfluous. Parentheses themselves shouldn't be italicised unless they are part of text that is in italics, such as, ''the monkey ate all the bananas (Mia's only sustenance) in just a few moments).'' -
[Rrius]: I just saw the downtown Bloomington antenna above. I went to IWU and remember it well. Are you from B-N? -
[Rrius]: It is striking the way it appears as you drive south on Center St. -
[Rrius]: If no one else responds at [[Talk:United States Senate]] really soon, I'd say take it as consensus. Also, try to restore the Seniority section. I don't know if you meant to delete it, but it really should be there. If it was tucked into another new section, never mind. -
[Rrius]: Just like the last reorganization at [[United States Senate]], you deleted {{tl|United States Senate}}, and didn't replace it. If you have a problem with that template, you should take it to the talk page. -
[Rrius]: From what I can tell, the main thing you did was move section on qualifications above the one on the oath, which makes sense. You also fixed a quote template. You should note that years are usually not wikilinked unless they are part of full date for autoformatting purposes (which is itself controversial at the moment). -
[Rrius]: I'm sorry if I'm coming across as rude or snippy. I'm a little tired, and probably shouldn't be doing any talk page discussions right now. I've started a discussion at the article talk page, and I'll let it go for a while and see what happens. -
[Rrius]: You are mistaken about the oath. That is not when an appointed senator's term begins. The Senate can refuse to seat someone, but only when the senator doesn't meet the qualifications or the election or appointment is deemed to be the result of corruption. When an appointed senator is rejected, the Senate isn't saying, \""he can't be a senator\"", it is retroactively saying, \""he was never truly a senator\"". That the date of appointment is the date the terms begins is settled as a matter of law and tradition. I have listed several senators as examples at [[Talk:Paul G. Kirk, Jr.]]. Getting back to Burris, he is an exception because, unlike most other appointed senators, his date of appointment is not his seniority date. That fact is a result of the bizarre happenings at the beginning of this year, including the late understanding by Reid and Durbin that, based on Supreme Court precedent, they almost certainly could not just vote to refuse to seat Burris. -
[Rrius]: With Kirk and Burris, we are talking about appointed senators. There are different rules for appointed senators, senators elected to fill a vacancy, and senators elected for a full term. The terms of appointed senators begin on the date of appointment. The beginning date of terms of senators elected to fill a vacancy depend on whether the Senate is still in session at the time of the election. The terms of senators elected for a full term begin on January 3 so long as their credentials are presented at the beginning of the term. Thus, even though the contest was not his fault, Franken was in the same boat as Jay Rockefeller was at the beginning of his first term. Rockefeller wanted to finish his term as governor, so he didn't show up until January 25. As a result, his term began that day. Franken presented his credentials on July 7, so that is the day his term began. The applicable law is just different from the law applicable to appointees. -
[Rrius]: Lincoln Chafee was appointed on November 2, 1999, and sworn in on November 4, 1999. The Congressional Record for [http:\/\/frwebgate.access.gpo.gov\/cgi-bin\/getpage.cgi?dbname=1999_record&page=S13881&position=all November 3]. Chafee's  [http:\/\/bioguide.congress.gov\/scripts\/biodisplay.pl?index=C001040 biographical sketch] says he served from November 2, 1999 to January 3, 2007. -
[Rrius]: Another way to think of it is in terms of agency law. If an employee acts outside his authority, the employer can ratify the action, in which case the employee is considered to have had the authority at the time he acted. In a similar vein, the Congress has chosen with 2 USC sec. 36 (for appointed and some specially elected senators) and sec. 33 (for senators elected to a full term) chosen to say that terms will begin before the Senate passes judgment. Again I urge you to read the article I have linked to. -
[Rrius]: Back between election day and January 6 we used January 6 as the \""assuming office\"" date. It didn't really violate crystal ball because there was no reason to believe any of them wouldn't seated. Because we any intention to not seat someone would be signalled ahead of time, it is okay to assume they are going to be seated unless there is some warning, as in the case of Burris. For senators-elect, like the person about to be elected in Massachussets or who like Franken are going to take their full term seat late, it is fair to use the date on which it is reported they will take the oath. The appointees are really the problem. It is always going to be controversial to say \""Assumed office [future date]\"" when they haven't taken the oath. An answer might be add two new parameters to the template: |appointed_date= and |takes_oath=. I'll propose it at {{tl|Infobox Officeholder}}. -
[Rrius]: The closest we have is the [http:\/\/bioguide.congress.gov\/biosearch\/biosearch.asp Biographical Directory]. It is sometimes wrong, but rarely. When you find it is wrong or questionable, the best thing to do is e-mail the Historical Office (historian at sec.senate.gov). I've had good experiences with them. -
[Rrius]: I'm not quite sure how to handle his House start date. I'm not sure it's quite as simple as he was Lt. Governor of California until November 5, so he couldn't have been a U.S. Representative on November 3 & 4. The California Constitution prevents California's officers from simultaneously holding federal office. The U.S. Constitution does not prevent its officials from holding state office. If that were the last word, Garamendi would have stopped being  Lt. Governor on becoming a U.S. Representative. Of course, it is equally likely that, under California law and custom, he hadn't become a representative until yet, but under U.S. law he became one on November 3. Finally, it could be that by custom the House recognizes a delay in assuming the office when the person holds a office that under state law is incompatible with holding federal office. Each of these is plausible, but the only evidence for when Garamendi became a rep is his [http:\/\/bioguide.congress.gov\/scripts\/biodisplay.pl?index=G000559 Congressional Biography page], which says he has served since November 3. What are your thoughts. -
[Rrius]: The comparison to Biden is inapposite. Biden was elected in November 2008 for a term beginning in January 2009, there is no question of overlap. The more appropriate comparison is to [[Kirsten Gillibrand]], who was appointed to the Senate on January 23, but since she was a U.S. Representative at the time, it did not take effect until her resigation on January 26. Her term began on January 26 even though she did not take the oath until January 27. -
[Rrius]: I am working my back with special election winners to draw them into line with reality. I realize that they are called \""representatives-elect\"", but the same was true of all representatives on January 6, even though they had become representatives on January 3. It is a minor technical point, but we should get it right. Again, though, I'm not quite sure what to do with Garamendi for the reasons I stated above. I'll try to contact the House's historical office (I can't remember the name off hand); if they decide they should have taken his being lt. gov. into account, then the'll change his entry. If not, I'll feel more secure with November 3. I just don't know what to do for the time being, so I guess I'll just leave it for now. -
[Rrius]: Do you know an admin that can move [[Reconciliation Act of 2010]] to [[Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010]] once the Special Rule is adopted in the House, which by its terms adopts an amendment to the bill that amends the short title? -
[Rrius]: I should have mentioned that Markles doesn't appear to be online. I'm not sure who else among the usual crowd are admins. -
[Rrius]: Thanks, [[User:Kurykh|Kurykh]] took care of it. At least now I know some more names for the next time something like this comes up. -
[Rrius]: {{ec}} It is not predominately a British style. If it were, it would be spelled with a \""u\"". We did not fight a \""fucking war\"" over whether government officials should be styled \""the honorable\"", and any suggestion to the contrary is fatuous. Your belief that the style \""the Honorable\"" has anything to do with royalty shows a hopelessly confused mind on this issue. Does calling [[Richard Daley]] \""His Honor\"" somehow betray monarchist sympathies? You have been pointed out to be completely wrong on this topic and are now just trying to justify your opposition despite your lack of facts. -
[Rrius]: I've already been to the talk page mentioned above. -
[Rrius]: And will you stop reverting until we've finished, for christ's sake? -
[Rrius]: I'm not sure why Therequiembellishere isn't responding, but the reason is that by-elections are normally not included at that article. I've added it back with a note about why it is not a normal situation, but I am not going to defend the edit. If you want to, be my guest. -
[Rrius]: I'm a bit confused by your change in protection. Three IP editors vandalised, and none of it went up. From what I can tell, the pending-changes system was working well. -
[Rrius]: Now that the election is done and gone and we have a decent number of peerage for Cameron that are either listed or about to be listed, do you think it would be appropriate to break him off from the Labour PMs? Size-wise, a 1997\u20132010 article would be the rough equivalent of the other two, and, thematically, a list covering the 13 years of Labour would nicely parallel the 18 Conservative years of Thatcher and Major. As I understand it, the current crop of 56 new peers are set to be joined by new Tory and Lib Dem peers in the near future, so it is not as though this is going to be a stubby list article. Let me know what you think. -
[Rrius]: Good lord. Speeding is illegal; would \""tiresquealer\"" be offensive? Also, [[bong]]s are used for tobacco, which is still legal in every [[U.S. state]] (for now), and bongs are routinely sold legally (for tobacco purposes only) throughout the U.S. I realize these people are trolls and all, but can't they find something less idiot to troll about? -
[Rrius]: I think you were giving my fellow Americans too much credit in your edit summary at [[George W. Bush]]. I'm betting the writer didn't even know Blair was out of office by 2009. -
[Rrius]: I too assume it was an American; I just figure he or she was wrong for a different reason. While people knew who Blair was even before the Iraq War, most had never heard of poor Gordon until his press conference just before resigning. And then it was only because Jon Stewart made a bid deal out of it. On the other side, most Americans other than reporters are uncomfortable enough with calling a former president \""President\"" that I just doubt that's it. -
[Rrius]: Unlike most of my countrymen, I'm well aware of his phone-throwing tendencies. My friends all think I'm weird for following British politics, but I think it's their loss. I mean, the entire Brown premiership was exciting political theatre no matter whether you were a Brownite, Blairite, Tory, or even Lib Dem. The best we ever get are political mini-series like the Clinton impeachment or the Florida recount. -
[Rrius]: I have to say, I'm shocked we're the same person. It puts our various disagreements over the years in a new, psychologically disturbing light. I hope you're the real one because having a Queen would be awesome. Plus, it would make staying up to watch the Royal Wedding as I did easier to explain. -
[Rrius]: Could you please reduce the Conservatives and Sinn Fein by one, add the Speaker and a vacancy? The Speaker is not a Conservative anymore, and [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] and [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] treat him that way. I'd do it myself, but I can't get the [[:File:Parliament2010UK.svg|file]] to work in a text editor. -
[Rrius]: Nevermind, I got it to work. -
[Rrius]: It is not true that it should always be \""work\"" and not \""publisher\"" for the [[Template:Cite news]]. The former italicises the text provided, so should be used for newspapers and magazines. Online, television, and other sources that are not italicised take the \""publisher\"" parameter. -
[Rrius]: First, the answer is that MOSCAPS says so. There is no accepted style guide that says website names are italicised, and our doesn't include it either. If we accepted your position, this project would be called ''Wikipedia'', but it is nowhere, not on the web or in print, italicised. If you are linking to an article at guardian.co.uk, you can simply say it is the ''The Guardian'', so long as it is not just a web feature, but you never italicise a web address such as \""guardian.co.uk\"", unless it happens to be the name of a book or television show or the like. -
[Rrius]: Sorry, but you are wrong. \""guardian.co.uk\"" is a url and the name of a webpage, not the title of a work. If you want to cite to the newspaper, you call it ''The Guardian''. If you want to highlight that it is the website, you don't italicise. I know you don't like it, but that is too bad. There is simply no authority for italicising online sources. It is never ''BBC News''; rather, it is BBC News. You also for some reason italicised \""Transport for London\"", which makes no sense whatever: Transport for London is an transport agency, not a press agency of any kind. -
[Rrius]: While I found your assertion that my version was unsourced and OR laughable since it retained the only sourced claim made in the prior version, I found your \""colloquial\"" claim incomprehensible. Can you point to whatever phrase or phrases you found colloquial? -
[Rrius]: It was always dubious, so I've edited away the \""few\"" bit. The inability to establish it was one of the reasons the article was deleted in the first place. -
[Rrius]: There is no \""right\"" way to number these things. For instance, sometimes people who have non-consecutive terms are counted twice; sometimes they aren't. You just have to go along with whatever the sources say. -
[Rrius]: LW, your tone is unnecessarily confrontational, and your self-righteousness regarding MOS is laughable considering your edits. Look again at the title of the article you are talking about\u2014it is not [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]. [[Al-Quaeda]] is an article about an international topic and should use the international date format. While hidden links should use the date format actually used in the article title, using US dates in reference to the attacks in articles that are not US-centric is arguable, but certainly not the definite proposition you seem to think. What makes your attitude hypocritical is that your solution was to use the date format you used in your contribution above: \""September 11th, 2001\"". If you had bothered to read more of MOSDATE than the part you quoted, you would have seen that the \""-th\"" is unacceptable. Next time, make sure of your facts before lashing out. This may be part of the internet, but that doesn't give you license to attack without bothering to grasp the facts. -
[Rrius]: Al Quaeda is focused in a dmy part of the world. It is becoming less and less clear to me how you define strong national ties to a date format. If a topic has its strongest ties to countries other than the United States or Canada, it's ties are to a dmy country (or, as in this case, countries). -"

[Hildanknight]: I just finished rewriting [[Homerun (film)]] and will soon nominate it for GA status. However, the article needs a copy-edit. Someone on IRC told me: \""If you want brilliant copy-editing, just ask Awadewit\"". Could you copy-edit [[Homerun (film)]]? --
[Hildanknight]: No. I will ask him to copy-edit it, then. Thanks for referring me to him. --
[Hildanknight]: Greetings, Jacklee! I hope your PhD is not causing you permanent head damage! When not working on your thesis, perhaps you could research and write a GA about [[Singapore in Malaysia]] for our National Day project? For an experienced and profilic GA writer like you, doing so in three months should not be too difficult if you can get your hands on several good history books (not my secondary school History textbooks, though). Alternatively, you could write a DYK or two, but we would still need someone to work on [[Singapore in Malaysia]], and you are probably the only SGpedian capable of doing so (unless [[User:Aldwinteo|Aldwinteo]] becomes prolific again). Kindly let me know, by the end of the month, what you plan to work on (I, a JC student, plan to write no less than four articles for our project, and have already started working on the articles). --
[Hildanknight]: Unfortunately, [[Singapore in Malaysia]] is probably the only Singapore-related article that can appear in [[Wikipedia:On this day|On this day]] on 9 August. But you only need to push it to GA status, not FA, and should you succeed, it will appear there ''every'' 9 August, while the FA and DYKs will only appear on the Main Page on ''one'' 9 August. I agree that [[Singapore in Malaysia]] is an ambitious project, but as a prolific and experienced GA writer, you are capable enough (as I said above, get your hands on some good history books). If you have the interest and ability, but lack the time due to your PhD, perhaps we could agree to postpone the National Day Project to next year? With over a year to plan and write, we should be even more ambitious (for example, you may want to write more than one article and we could recruit more editors). --
[Hildanknight]: To the right of [[Wikipedia:Did you know|Did you know]]? is [[Wikipedia:On this day|On this day]], where [[Singapore in Malaysia]] will appear every 9 August if it attains GA status. The article must undergo a separate OTD nomination process after passing GAN (we could ask a GA reviewer to \""cut queue\""); the details of the OTD nomination process are unclear, so I must find out the details. By the way, could you do me a favour by searching Factiva for \""Money No Enough\"" and e-mailing me the results (hopefully the database goes back to 1998)? --
[Hildanknight]: Oi! Knock knock, poke poke... --
[Hildanknight]: Newspaper articles received. Thanks! \u8c22\u8c22! Terima kasih! Is ten weeks enough time to push [[Singapore in Malaysia]] to GA status? If not, we could postpone the entire project to next year. --
[Hildanknight]: Jacklee, do you plan to write [[Singapore in Malaysia]] this year or next year? Either option is fine with me, but I need to know your decision, as it will affect my GA-writing plans for the June holidays (and early Term 3). --
[Hildanknight]: Hello, Jacklee! Have you finished your PhD? Looks like no Singapore-related articles attained GA status during my year-long wikibreak. Fret not, though, for I am back and have just rewritten [[Xiaxue]], an article which could break our GA jinx! Before the article goes to GAN, it needs to be copyedited, updated and checked for BLP compliance. Perhaps you could help copyedit and BLP check it? Do you still have access to Factiva? Please let me know if I could help you with any of your potential GAs ([[Goh Keng Swee]] looks like one). --
[Hildanknight]: Congratulations on completing your PhD dissertation! Please use Factiva to search for, and Gmail to me, newspaper articles on the following: '''Xiaxue''', '''Pathlight School''' and '''Tampines Rovers'''. Thanks! --
[Hildanknight]: For Pathlight School, January 2003 onwards. For Tampines Rovers, January 2002 onwards. Is that fine with you? My e-mail address is hildanknight(AT)gmail(DOT)com. Thanks in advance! --
[Hildanknight]: Hello again, Jacklee! How are you? This is a gentle reminder to do Factiva searches for '''Xiaxue''', '''Pathlight School''' (January 2003 onwards) and '''Tampines Rovers''' (January 2002 onwards; please let me know if there are too many results and I could further narrow the date range). Another editor has [[Talk:Xiaxue#Refs.2C notability etc.|expressed concern]] about some of the references in [[Xiaxue]]; your Factiva search and input in the discussion would greatly help resolve the issue. Thanks again for all your help throughout my Wikipedian career. --
[Hildanknight]: Thanks for the articles about Xiaxue and Pathlight School! That should keep me occupied for the rest of the month. As for Tampines Rovers, I need time to think about additional keywords and will get back to you soon. All the best to you! --
[Hildanknight]: Thanks for showing me this resource! Then for Factiva, I would only need articles about \""Tampines Rovers\"" and \""Tampines Stadium\"" from 2007 onwards. Meanwhile, I have filed peer reviews for [[Money No Enough]] and [[Xiaxue]] to prepare them for GA nominations; [[Wikipedia:Peer review\/Money No Enough\/archive1|any and all constructive]] [[Wikipedia:Peer review\/Xiaxue\/archive1|reviews would be appreciated]]. Could you also help monitor [[Xiaxue]] for vandalism and BLP violations? Thank you. \u8c22\u8c22. Terima kasih. Arigato. Will file a peer review for [[Goh Keng Swee]] and your other potential GAs in the near future. --
[Hildanknight]: I added some information to the last paragraph of the Reception section, so could you copyedit it again? In addition, I am not sure what you mean by \""two of them described as copycats of Money No Enough\"". By \""described\"", I mean described by critics, not by the official advertising or those involved in production. --
[Hildanknight]: Hello, Phil; how are you? Remember me from our chat at #wikipedia-en? The Singaporean movie article is [[Money No Enough]] (its peer review is at [[Wikipedia:Peer review\/Money No Enough\/archive1]]) and the other article is about a highly successful, but highly controversial, Singaporean blogger, [[Xiaxue]] (its peer review is at [[Wikipedia:Peer review\/Money No Enough\/archive1]]). Your reviews would be most appreciated! Thank you. \u8c22\u8c22. Terima kasih. Arigato. --

I have written articles about [[Money No Enough]] (1998 Singaporean film that sparked the development of the Singaporean film industry) and [[Xiaxue]] (highly successful, but also highly controversial, Singaporean celebrity blogger), both of which are potential [[WP:GA|GA]]s. Like most Singaporeans, I am not a native speaker of English and need some help to meet the \""well written\"" [[WP:WIAGA|GA criterion]]. Could you support the quest to [[WP:CSB|counter systemic bias on Wikipedia]] by giving constructive comments at [[Wikipedia:Peer review\/Money No Enough\/archive1|Money No Enough's peer review]] and [[Wikipedia:Peer review\/Xiaxue\/archive1|Xiaxue's peer review]] (the latter needs reviews more urgently)? \u8c22\u8c22\u60a8\uff01--
[Hildanknight]: Hello, Zscout370! I will see how I can help you get [[Coat of arms of Singapore]] to GA status; it is very close. I recently rewrote [[Money No Enough]] and [[Xiaxue]], both of which are on peer review in preparation for GA nominations. Could you give some constructive comments at [[Wikipedia:Peer review\/Money No Enough\/archive1|Money No Enough's peer review]] and [[Wikipedia:Peer review\/Xiaxue\/archive1|Xiaxue's peer review]]?

[Lexein]: Rockin'.  Dinner engagement delayed me. --
[Lexein]: Not to worry. If I'm erring, it's on the side of AGF i's-dotted-t's-crossed.  In retrospect, I do wish all the nom's had been separate, though. --
[Lexein]: Watch out for [[WP:JUSTDONTLIKEIT]]. All of your false edit summaries do nothing but stack up against you. Your interpretations of policy are way off, and your unhelpful edits are unwelcome in this article. Read the supporting citations.--

[Lexein]: ''Followup''. Thanks for preserving the above through the recent revert blizzard.  Assuming you have by now read the above, I have just applied a minor edit to [[WP:BLP]] to make the link to [[WP:MOSBIO|Manual of Style (biographies)]] at the bottom visibly obvious. --
[Lexein]: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Talk%3AAntonio_Arnaiz-Villena#Arnaiz-Villena_was_sacked_from_Editorial_Board. Here, ] you remark \""look who's back\"" without mentioning a name.  This is, I must say, a smidge snarky, and doesn't help me quickly understand what may be a volatile situation. The claim that the person was dismissed is supported by the citation presented.  It is my belief that it can be written in a neutral way, conforming to the letter and spirit of [[WP:BLP]].   It is not my intention to debate the subject of the article, politics or anything beyond this one claim and its RS citation. Is it your position that the claim and citation SHOULD or SHOULD NOT be added to the article?  Please reply here - I watch my watchlist. Thank you. --
[Lexein]: Your continued contributions would be welcome - specifically, finding a source for \""It has been suggested...\"" --
[Lexein]: --

[Lexein]: You're certainly welcome, but really, it's just our job to help new editors find their way around the harsh mistress that Wikipedia can be.  It's always best to not use provocative language, and to ignore it when written by others.  I'm glad it worked out. --
[Lexein]: Labelling something \""unencyclopedic\"" doesn't make it so.  Her publicly, and multiply documented and sourced statements are decidedly \""encyclopedic.\"" I'm reverting your \""agree\"" deletion as inadequately explained and undiscussed, and out of step with long-standing agreement by many, many other editors. That someone (perhaps) canvassed you for help does nothing to support your position. I won't be silent in the face of deletion of sourced content. Discuss in [[Talk:Helena Christensen]]. --
[Lexein]: No. ''She'' stated she is a cheese lover, and the rather diverse sources (in both type and time period) support the claim.  It's completely appropriate to resist removal of reliably sourced material, even if you and some other drive-by deletionist [[WP:IDONTLIKEIT|don't like it]]. --
[Lexein]: Good. I look forward to some attention by independent editors, some of whom might be inclusionists, and some of whom might be deletionists.  I look forward to their correction of your misunderstanding of 3RR, and your false characterization of \""insert\"", \""all\"" and inappropriate claim of \""dubious noteworthiness.\"" Do stop falsely characterizing my legitimate actions as editor against unjustified deletionism.  I've done no \""insertions\"", only reverting repeated deletions, which continued after discussion was begun.  Your use of \""all\"" exaggerates the number of editors actually discussing - it's two: you and I. The other seems to have bowed out. My edit history will stand up to any scrutiny you may wish to bring. Cheers. --
[Lexein]: No, the previous debate took place ''with you''.  No other editors were involved, and there is no need for any other editor to \""support my position\"" since my position was then, and is now, sound. ''Re-deletion following commencement of discussion'' was the actual edit warring. But don't take my word for it, I hope other editors will remind you of this.  I \""inserted\"" nothing, for the simple reason that reversion of an unjustified deletion of long-standing, well-sourced, and undisputed content (by any _other_ editors), and reversion of a deletion made after discussion commenced, cannot fairly be labeled \""insertion\"".  The subject of the article made these claims about herself, on multiple occasions, to multiple sources. Not much debate about that. --
[Lexein]: 1. I have not finished my response.  2. In ''general'', what you say about consensus is correct. However, specifically, two editors, only one of whom is an interested regular contributor to an article, should not constitute consensus, against a long-time contributor. Also, I'm not in vio of 3RR. Please read my response in a few minutes. I will certainly request 30, since that is the next step in dispute resolution. 3. What is your position with respect to WP:AN\/EW process? I don't see your comment there. --
[Lexein]: Ok. I have completed my response at AN\/EW. I think HW's false characterization of my statement should not override my actual statement - I've responded to that. As for consensus, I will happily abide by the outcome of an RfC. Hopefully ''several'' or ''many'' more editors will chime in - larger numbers make it easier for me to accept consensus. --
[Lexein]: It was an edit conflict, and there were so many changes I didn't see the EL changes.  I mentioned the conflict, and apologized on the Talk page. I'm restoring the EL changes right now, but there was another edit conflict.--

CasualObserver'48,False,"[CasualObserver'48]: I understand the specifics above, but got here from a similar edit, and tend to agree with John. There are many instances where procon is a melding ref for both POVs. In the general arena where pro and con are so evident and exclusionary, this site tends to place them as part of the whole, and says so. I also somewhat question the passive usage 'of being spammed'. What does that mean, that some are citing it more regularly on Wikipedia?  Is that a valid reason to delete a ref and replace it with a fact-tag? It might be seen as less-than-adequate AGF."

Also, if the section is an overview, I think it should be an overview of the article (no sources) or an overview of the ideas out there (more than one source).
[SCStrikwerda]: Thanks.  I will try to rework an overview section with pros and cons - once I have time!  There are many people and organizations with opinions on the pros and cons - it could take a while.
[SCStrikwerda]: Johnfos, I've thought about the Sovacool statement a bit more.  While many things in nuclear power are contentious, the fact that dangerous toxins are used or exist in nuclear power is not, nor is the fact that nuclear power produces many of the same radionuclides as nuclear weapons.  If you want to keep the sentence there, that's fine, and if you want to keep the reference, that's fine, but the in-text attribution makes it look like it is Sovacool's idea alone.

[Loom91]: Thanks for your tips. I actually knew that, but I was in a hurry so I forgot.
[Loom91]: You will notice that a very large number of images in Wikipedia are not thumbed. Aesthetic considerations must be taken into account, and that image looks horribly ugly when thumbed. It is not Wikipedia policy or guideline to thumb images, we must select whatever looks better. Please keep the image in a size sufficiently large to look good.
[Loom91]: I'm not spamming user pages and the policy explicitly forbids anything against US law, so both of these claims are baseless. I've not violated any Wikipedia policies, so I do not see how I can get blocked.
[Loom91]: A watered-down version of the proposed policy against censorship is now open for voting. Will you kindly review the policy and make your opinions known? Thank you very much.
[Loom91]: I think many who would take our side against the menace of censorship do not know about this poll. If you have some time to spare, would you mind posting a short message on their talk page (like mine) to let them know of this poll and invite them to voice their opinions? By involving more people, a larger portion of the Wikipedia community can have their say, for or against the policy. Some places you can go for a list of users are [[Wikipedia_talk:Censorship#Support]], Category:Wikipedians_against_censorship and Category:Wikipedians_opposed_to_censorship_of_the_human_body,. Please check that I've not already posted a message with the heading [[Wikipedia_talk:Censorship]] in their talk page to avoid double-postings. If you don't have the time, feel free to ignore this request. Thank you.
[Loom91]: A revised version of the proposed policy against censorship is now open for voting. Will you kindly review the policy and make your opinions known? Thank you very much.
[Loom91]: I have not violated any WIkipedia policy or even guideline. In fact my actions are permited by the Wikipedia policy on Spamming (see under subjeading Internal Spaming). Keane has blocked me for his personal reasons and not from the blocking policy. I believe it was a good faith mistake on the par of Keane and he assumed policies which were not actualy there, but it seems nobody is taking the trouble to unblock me. I've already emailed Keane and the mailing list, I'm losing valuable time here unable to edit Wikipedia. If someone else thinks I did not do anything wrong, would that person please unblock me\/request an admin to unblock me? Thank you.
[Loom91]: That discussion also seems to indicate that some editors think the block is unwarranted and I was not commiting any disruption. Wikipedia policies and a sense of what is best for the encyclopaedia allow me to do this (see below) and nothing prohibits me except the personal taste of some sysops.
[Loom91]: We are now voting on the second poll, it is an unfortunate misunderstanding that people are still voting in the first poll. It's my fault actually, I should have been more specific in my messages. WOuld you (or someone else) mind leaving these users a short note on their talk page notifying them of their mistake and pointing to the second poll. Because of these \""wrong\"" votes, we are potentially getting a skewed idea of consensus here. Thank you.
[Loom91]: A high turnout at a vote is always regarded as a positive thing and makes for better consensus. Considering all, I hope you will agree that the block was not warranted and I should be unblocked and allowed to resume my work. I've worked at this project for a long time now and added a lot of content. I love the concept of an encyclopedia anyone can edit and it is a passion of mine. It grieves me to witness such misunderstandings and not be able to contribute to the project. Please set me free! Thank you.
[Loom91]: I did not spam anyone, as you can see that many people were actually benefited by my messages instead of being annoyed. I will never spam anyone, but if you consider my previous actions to be spamming I can not agree to not repeat them.
[Loom91]: The active Bangla population is growing in Wikipedia. How about opening a [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Bangla]]? One of the energetic folk like Dwaipyanak or Ragib may do it with some encouragement:)
[Loom91]: Hey, look at this, I don't even know your name! Quel est votre nom, Mademoiselle?
[Loom91]: It's a nice start. You may want to consider taking a look at the format devoloped at [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Schools]], [[Hare School]] which was written using the same template and a couple of Featured Articles on schools to see how they organise and present the information. Also consider [[Wikipedia:Citing Sources]] and [[WP:NPOV]]. Photographs make an article aesthetically more pleasing and convey information in a different format than text, so you may also consider adding some images. That should be enough to keep you working for a couple of months :)
[Loom91]: Also, I find that the Bangla project had previously been created at [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Bengal]] but has become inactive due to the lack of participants.
[Loom91]: Chalochittochanchari is my favorite Ray after HaJaBaRaLa. Remember Naxvomica-30? :D I have both a Yahoo! and a MSN ID, but I don't have nearly enough time to be actually active on those. After the studies, I barely find enough time to do daily maintenance tasks on the net. I'm severely alarming myself with the amount I'm studying, and I'm trying to motivate myself to put in a few more hours daily to cope with the pressure of preparing for IIT-JEE. I'm told that students start preparing for it from class 7, how horrible! Of my current teachers, only the Physics teacher seems to teach at the level of IIT-JEE, and that's a cause of concern. I'm particularly worried about my chemistry teacher, who knows a lot about chemistry (he's doing research on Inorganic Reaction Mechanism in JU) but seems to have a low faith in the abilities of his students and has set his standards very low. Anyway, I've rambled a lot about my studies. Do you know, I'm credited as the camera assistant in a Bangla Existensialist movie *gloat* :) Do you ever come to India?
[Loom91]: Actually I find tutors to be important. They help me to focus my studies and provide guidance. They also let me experience better teachers when the teachers from my own school are not so good. My existensialist movie hasn't released yet, I believe it's due sometime in August or September. What are you writing your EE on?
[Loom91]: Your ideas of 'discussion' and 'consensus' are rather intriguing. They seem to be focused around making threats of deleting others contributions and calling edits mindless vandalism.
[Loom91]: Chalta hai, duniya hai :-) Between school, studies, computer, friends, rather busy. It's hard finding time o sqeeze in everything. How are you? Kobe jano ekhane aschhis?
[Loom91]: Me too.
[Loom91]: Yeah, it released in Nandan. The reception was exceptional by Nandan standards. We hit house full in the third day. We grossed 32000 in a week in a 200-seater hall even with virtually no publicity. For comparison, the heavily publicized Manush Bhoot running in the 1000-seater grossed 47000 in 2 weeks.

[Loom91]: Yes, I'm on orkut under loom91, but I don't go there often. Not much to do.
[Loom91]: CBM insists that I can't mention Joy Basu's play unless I give a source. While this is technically within policy, I do not understand the point. There is nothing remotely negative about claiming someone wrote a play that has been performed by a mainstream theater group, and it would be extremely difficult to get sources (I will have to go to physical newspaper archives and hunt for reviews). Why does he insist upon contesting such a non-controversial assertion? This is not covered by BLP.
[Loom91]: Also, please take a look at the talk of intro to math of general relativity. It must be moved to some other name (preferably as a precursor to merging), and I'm looking for suggestions.
[Loom91]: To safeguard against the future, it would probably be best to delete that redirect.
[Loom91]: Thanks for that. KSmrq is getting on my nerves. I guess I just need to avoid math articles for a few days to cool down. Meanwhile, an anon is repeatedly reverting me at [[Introduction to special relativity]], even after I attempted to reach a compromise by putting his historical content (of what relevance to the article, God knows) in a footnote. Since you seem to be online, will you take a look at the matter? I'll like to resolve this without wasting the time of the guys at WikiProject Physics.
[Loom91]: Thanks. Recently, everything I do seems to be controversial :-) I was thinking of running for admin towards the end of this year, but I'll need to be extra careful about potential controversies to polish my reputation after this. Do you know if the 3RR applies for reverting anons?
[Loom91]: Now the anon has ecided to escalate the situation by deleting large chunks of text and again inserting his para about imaginary time. It's also untrue that I'll not have any compromise, I put the material in a footnote. I'm pushing 3RR, so could you please revert him?
[Loom91]: Thanks.
[Loom91]: The naming convention says \""Use the title more commonly recognized by English readers\"". Ray's movies are most commonly known by their original titles (spelled in the Roman alphabet), even among English speakers.

But your comment \""''if the opposition was inadmissable, there was no opposition''\"" is actually wrong IMHO. See e.g. {{EPO Guidelines|d|iv|1|2}} or Visser, ed. 2009, p. 227, if you have it. An opposition can only be rejected as inadmissible if the opposition has been first deemed to have been filed, and, if it is deemed to have been filed, the opposition exists, even if later the opposition is rejected as inadmissible. It makes at least a difference for the refund of the opposition fee. --

[Torchwoodwho]: Yes, but that's a different issue. The AfD wasn't closed so it was inappropriate to remove the notice. Removing the notice doesn't close the AfD or stop the consequences when it is closed. It's against policy to remove an open AfD notice and it can be considered vandalism. You seem like a good contributor and I don't want you to fall in to behavior that could have consequences toward your continued editing on wikipedia.

BlueRobe is blocked for a week, you've made your points at RfC and ANI and if you have an issue with Darkstar1st you should take it to a noticeboard, not the talk page of a blocked user. Obviously you and Darkstar don't see eye to eye and for the time being you should probably stay clear of this editor to limit disruption to the project. If Darkstar comes to your talk page or makes more personal attacks on you, elevate the situation by asking for review at ANI. I doubt mediation would work in this context, but you could also attempt it... but only if this continues after you make an honest effort to disengage.--
[Torchwoodwho]: There's nothing wrong with responding where a conversation starts, but I think it's good form to make sure it's started in the right place to begin with. Darkstar made a comment to BlueRobe, not to you. Although it was in reference to you it's nothing that Darkstar hasn't already said in several talk spaces, multiple time. An appropriate place to respond would have been Darkstar's talk page only referencing BlueRobe's in a link.

[ScienceApologist]: [[coral calcium]]. I just put in some references, but there is a lot more that can be done. That someone would think that coral calcium can be used as a panacea for all types of cancer when in fact excess calcium can, in some cases, be detrimental to certain cancer treatments means that we should be very careful how the claims of the coral calcium fanatics are treated.
[ScienceApologist]: There is a principle of one-way linking for fringe topics that prevents soapboxing. The idea is that if an idea is notable, we can discuss it in its relevant article. So if a homeopathic remedy is notable, it should be discussed in an article about the homeopathic remedy. However, homeopathy is rarely relevant outside the world of homeopathic medicine: most mainstream sources ignore it when describing plants or chemicals. Therefore, we should not be in the business of advertising homeopathy at those mainstream articles. Undue weight sometimes means no weight at all.
[ScienceApologist]: The issue is that homeopathic remedies rarely contain the substances they claim to use. It is only on the say-so of the homeopaths that substances are used in their remedies. This is far different than an herbalist or a folk medicine practioner or even a doctor of traditional Chinese medicine using the actual substance. Those are actual, verifiable, documented uses of the substance: their efficacy is beside the point. The homeopathist does not verifiably use any substance except for water, parafin, alcohol, and other solvents without solute.
[ScienceApologist]: Your friend obviously hasn't studied [[fossilization]] in great detail. Mineral replacement is a [[stochastic process]] not a magical replacement mechanism. In very particular cases, fossilization is incomplete even over millions of years.
[ScienceApologist]: That's a laugh. [[Petroleum]] survives underground for millions of years without turning into stone. Under the right conditions of pressure, temperature, and chemical environment organic material can be preserved for millions of years. In rare cases, it can be preserved to a remarkable level!
[ScienceApologist]: Generally, creationists rely on sources that are not very [[WP:RS|reliable]]. That's usually why they find themselves reverted.
[ScienceApologist]: 
[ScienceApologist]: For me, exacting standards is a very high praise.
[ScienceApologist]: The wording sounds fine to me, although I'm not sure what measure of plausibility we're employing.
[ScienceApologist]: Yes, certainly by the measure of the existence of atoms and molecules, orthomolecular medicine is more plausible. My issue, though, is that there is no evidence that orthomolecular medicine is any more ''effective'' than magic water memory. What's worse, orthomolecular medicine has the potential to be much more harmful than homeopathy, for example. People can die of vitamin overdoses, for example.
[ScienceApologist]: 
[ScienceApologist]: 
[ScienceApologist]: Okay, I thank you for explaining. Just know that in the future it's nicer when someone who asks for discussion to be had on a talk page starts the discussion themselves. Otherwise it just feels really like I'm trying to negotiate with mute ghosts.
[ScienceApologist]: It wasn't I who introduced that sentence.
[ScienceApologist]: \""mainstream\"" is a word to avoid because it indicates that the Bates method might somehow be scientific, which all but the most tried-and-true believers acknowledge it is not. The scientific evidence comes from various Opthamology Texts. [http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/journal\/00396257 For example]. \""Scientific evidence\"" is a catch-all term for the facts elucidated by a huge discipline. It's not simply a viewpoint that this is what causes vision loss: [[evidence-based medicine]] requires a connection to data and scientific evidence.
[ScienceApologist]: I'm not sure what you're getting at. The evidence is reported in standard opthamology texts. The persistence of the various forms of ametropia is attributed in all the texts referenced to anatomical, not physiological, conditions.
[ScienceApologist]: No, I understand what evidence means perfectly well. As far as Wikipedia goes, we need [[WP:RS|reliable]], [[WP:V|verifiable]] sources that are not [[WP:UNDUE|unduly]] [[WP:SYNTH|synthesized]] by [[WP:FRINGE|fringe]] [[WP:COI|proponents]] with [[WP:ADVERT|obvious]] [[WP:SOAP|agendas]]. Unfortunately, this is not yet to be had at this page.
[ScienceApologist]: It is not appropriate to remove tags when they are being discussed on the talk page. Do NOT do that again.
[ScienceApologist]: 
[ScienceApologist]: Involved usually means that the administrator has taken a position vis-a-vis the general situation in which I am constantly involved. The user to which you are referring has stated on more than one occasion that he thinks that civility trumps content contributions, and, as such, has asked for harsh judgments be made in a particular direction in such cases. I am all for people taking sides, but I think once administrators do that they must necessarily get their actions reviewed by other administrators. In that particular case, the user also left Wikipedia for a time in part because of interactions with me. I find it hard to believe that this makes this administrator impartial. There are roughly six administrators whom I feel are too compromised to use their administrator tools responsibly when I'm involved. I can list them for you privately. You are not one of them.

[ScienceApologist]: 
[ScienceApologist]: I agree with most everything you said in your analysis apart from the juicy gossip that I cannot directly verify. One comment, though: it's been perennially easy to be hard on arbcom; in fact, it won't take too much digging in my history to see my take on them. It seems to me now that they're basically doing exactly what the committee was designed to do when it was first set-up. Wikipedia and arbcom are both intentionally dysfunctional because the only way the content could have been created and given its high Google-ranks in the first place was to open it to the peanut-gallery that is the internet. What we have entrenched now is a culture that values inane process over efficiency, brute force over nuance, and immature niceties over intellectual heft. Sounds like any other internet microcosm to me.
[ScienceApologist]: 
[ScienceApologist]: 
[ScienceApologist]: Bizarre. I guess the appropriate thing to do now is to keep all conversations about climate change off wiki. Plausible deniability seems to be the arbitration committee's preferred mode of operation. Transparency is to be eschewed. This is oddly in-keeping with their primary mode of deliberation.

[Desiphral]: Hi! I recently made the article for the [[Zanya]] neighborhood\/village of [[Ciurea]]. Currently in this commune there are recognized 7 villages. Usually Zanya\/Zanea was included in the village Ciurea as a neighborhood. In the recent years, informally, it started to be named also as village. I see that [http:\/\/www.medfam.ro\/bimf\/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=17&mode=thread&order=0&thold=0 here] Zanea is named as village, but still the number of official villages is 7. You have much more experience in locality official names on Wikipedia, so I'd like to ask you which name you think it should come first. In fact, first of all, I'm not sure when an inhabited area is officially considered as an informal neighborhood which name should have priority. Thanks,

[Alexh19740110]: Hi Stephan, we were discussing the possibility that Jimmy Wales is misquoted at William's biography page. I have asked Jimbo, and he agreed with me. I've left a note at the talk page. Someone without a COI such as myself should probably fix this up in the interests of being honest about what Wales said. I leave the matter to your good judgement. Best,
[Alexh19740110]: Hi Arnold, thanks for your input at BLP\/N. The trouble is, the problem is not going to go away. There are far too many editors with daggers in their eyes bent on using Wikipedia to express their personal judgement that living climate change skeptics are \""denialists\"". Any thoughts on how this can be handled moving forwards?
[Alexh19740110]: I regret to say that I can't agree that it works most of the time, as I have yet to find it working in even a single instance and I've tried to apply this policy quite a number of times. In principle, it could work in an odd situation where a single editor with an axe to grind was completely isolated in his POV. But in most cases, the POV will be shared by a number -- if not a large number -- of editors, and as you can see, it only takes a small group of three or four editors to shout out down all opposition. And in the event that the subject of a BLP is an \""enemy of the left\"" it's generally the case that there will be administrators stepping in to support these violations of the policy. In the present case, you'll note that Ratel is still reverting attempts to remove the material, e.g. [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Heaven_and_Earth_%28book%29&diff=312914435&oldid=312894469 here]. What next?
[Alexh19740110]: Regarding [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Heaven_and_Earth_%28book%29&action=history this] -- welcome to climate change! :)
[Alexh19740110]: Having read the above and the details of the AN\/I discussion I must apologise profusely for getting you involved in this matter. How so many editors managed to see you as an \""involved\"" editor in the content dispute utterly baffles me.
[Alexh19740110]: Stephan, it would be appreciated if you could contact Daniel Kirk-Davidoff privately to ask the question of whether or not he has been taken out of context in the Seed Magazine article. Note, I am effectively offline at the moment so probably won't see your response here for a while if you make one.
[Alexh19740110]: Hi, you recently restored a non-neutral image of Lord Monckton at his bio, in contradiction to our BLP policy, without comment. William Connolley has recently admitted on his blog [http:\/\/scienceblogs.com\/stoat\/2010\/01\/poor_old_monckton.php here] that the picture has been chosen because it makes Lord M look like a \""wacko\"". Would you care to explain why you did this, and preferrably, fix it up again for me, i.e. remove the image until a neutral one can be obtained. Thanks.
[Alexh19740110]: Kittybrewster, if you are cognizant of the fact that I am not alone in finding the image to be not neutral, tell me how it is that you're not able to understand that the BLP policy directs us to err conservatively in favour of those editors in these situations?
[Alexh19740110]: I haven't followed the case, but to see editors like yourself, Cla68, and A Quest For Knowledge in this list makes it pretty obvious that ArbCom is a really... blunt instrument.
[Alexh19740110]: Guettarda, in this edit here [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Talk:Hockey_stick_controversy&diff=436620139&oldid=436619761] you have archived an active thread I was participating in with the statement, ''If you can't produce a source to support your claims, you're just [[WP:SOAP|soapboxing]], which is an abuse to talk page''. While that thread was arguably heading off topic, what is certain is that it is an abuse of talk page guidelines and your role as an administrator involved in the discussion to unilaterally archive a thread and demand discussions terminate on your terms. Would you be so kind as to undo this please?
[Alexh19740110]: <s>Guettarda, editors are not in fact allowed to revert other editor's talk page changes in the climate change area, as you know, just as you are not allowed to delete another editor's comments or archive conversations you don't like. This reminds me of that favourite tactic of another very disruptive, now topic banned, editor. I also don't appreciate your personal attacks in the talk page, and given that you are administrator, I'll be more than happy to report this if this bullying continues.<\/s>
[Alexh19740110]: Do you think that this [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view\/Noticeboard&diff=437129181&oldid=437079558] is even vaguely acceptable?
[Alexh19740110]: I decided to strike the last comment I made; perhaps Boris has a point.
[Alexh19740110]: Well you were just plainly wrong. Fred Pearce himself had just confirmed everything I said. I don't understand how you can dispute this. Instead of conceding this fact, you suggested I could be lying, and responded with insults, false accusations (I hardly turn up once a month, as I have been mostly inactive for the last year), and smears (I hardly have a fringe POV about anything). Meanwhile, you appear to believe that if a reliable source states something as a fact, we can automatically state the same thing in Wikipedia's voice. NPOV says explicitly, in a number of places, that this is not true. So I say again, it would be good to read and understand the policy, especially if you are going to present yourself as an NPOV expert at NPOVN.
[Alexh19740110]: You need to read the whole policy, and not cherry pick bits you happen to like. By the way, do you recall me ever actually expressing a view that is 'down with the tinfoil-hat wearers' or is this an assumption? Also how old are you? Am I right to guess that you're male and in your early to mid 20s? I admit I am guessing this from the way you are talking.
[Alexh19740110]: Guettarda, in this edit you accused me of lying [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Talk:Hockey_stick_controversy&diff=438587712&oldid=438567593]. Since I have no idea what you are talking about I invite you to explain. If you can't substantiate this, please strike it. Thanks.
[Alexh19740110]: So are you going to provide ''relevant'' diffs, i.e. the diffs where I allegedly misrepresented a source? No, of course you aren't, because I haven't misrepresented any sources. It is just another gratuitous personal attack.
[Alexh19740110]: Hi DGG, thank you again for your input at [[Talk:Hockey stick controversy]] where you said, \""Criticism is almost always the better word [better than \""attack\""] for a Wikipedia article on anything controversial. The reader will decide on the nature of the criticism and the merits of the arguments.\"" You might be surprised that despite your input and that of two others who said the same thing, it is being claimed that because you qualified this with \""''almost'' always\"", it means that while you agreed on the specific point (\""criticism\"" not \""attack\""), you probably didn't agree on the general principle or interpretation of NPOV. Somehow they claim that you would still think that if a reliable source uses emotive, loaded language, it is generally better to the use exactly the same terms in the article to avoid misrepresenting the source or subtly altering the meaning or reducing the clarity. Is that actually your view or was I correct to take your statement as agreement on NPOV as well. Best,
[Alexh19740110]: I wish that was true. In his response he seems to want to say that this is exactly what he always said and once again asserts that I have mispresented him. Naturally I don't agree. He goes on to say that a mutually acceptable compromise was found but in fact it wasn't; I just gave up. Would you mind having a look at my response to see if you agree with my commentary? He also asked a question about Lysenko which I tried to answer and perhaps you'd like to give your view as well. I do feel, for what it's worth, that so much of the conflict in the climate change pages could be resolved if this point about NPOV is ever settled.
[Alexh19740110]: So what do you suggest. Edit warring?
[Alexh19740110]: Okay. But a serious question. What should I do. Raise another RfC for the next issue? We all know what happened to the good editors like Cla68 & AQuestForKnowledge when they requested Arbitration. So that's not an option. Should I just accept that I'm not welcome to edit in the topic area of my primary interest due to labeling I've received as a \""fringe theorist\""? I am not, by the way, on any \""side\"", and I have to say I resent the assumption, if it was an assumption, that because I'm under constant attack by the majority in there I must be on the \""other side\"". Certainly they keep repeating this loudly and as often as they can, but that doesn't make it true. My view is exactly the same as yours as stated above, \""too much of the motivations ''on each side'' are other than purely scientific\"". I couldn't agree more. I just don't like the way it seems to be directed at the present NPOV dispute, which would include me."

I have repeated my call for participants to confine themselves to edits concerning their own faith community. Please consider this seriously. I would like to see you make a unilateral offer to abide by this suggestion. An alternative would be for a report to be made on the relevant noticeboard that you have all been engaged in theologically motivated edit warring for months across a dozen articles or more, and letting the higher level administration sort it out.--
[Taiwan boi]: Richard, as Richwales has already pointed out there's nothing in my suggestion which is close to what you fear. There is no banning, there is no ghettoization, there is no insistence that this recommendation be generalized. I have seen no reason from you why the editors involved can't be asked to adhere to this voluntary code of conduct in order to reconcile a year long dispute which has been incredibly disruptive and which has had several admins simply give up on it because they can't control the editors involved. What I see is that LM is prepared to accept this solution, but Esoglou is not. That's significant because it shows exactly where the problem lies.--

avriette,False,"[avriette]: if you're going to go through and proactively change the submissions i made of multiple nodes for deletion, the least you could do is send me an email, ping me on irc, update my talk page, whatever. but just un-doing it and not saying anything is uncooperative and childish.
[avriette]: oh, i agree that fancruft is the right name for it. [[care bears]] are at the top of my list, but i think i'd like to throw myself on the star trek fan cruft too. every minor character to ever appear in star trek has their own page. cleaning that stuff up isn't hard, it's just a matter of convincing somebody (or groups of bodies) that a single page with sections for each minor character is just as effective as eight zillion pages of minor characters (or indeed MORE effective). some people just think that the wikipedia ought to include a definitive guide to each niche cultural item. and it isn't the case. i've got some others in mind. i suspect it will be an uphill battle. but i don't mind fighting it. when i have some \""real content\"" to provide, i'll quit the sisyphus act, and contribute. until then, i'll just do the meta- thing. reorganize. appreciate the apology. look forward to working together with you. are you available on irc at all? i'm looking for some guidance in both wikipedia culture, and also for procedures (eg my confusion wrt delete and vfd). i only just recently learned about the four-tilde signature, and i've been doing this for close to a year.
[avriette]: i don't give a goddamn what you think they are. they're not monsters, they're villains. they DO NOT DESERVE THEIR OWN PAGE IN THE WIKIPEDIA. that is why i placed them on the list of villains. you made an edit -- a REVERT -- without putting a note on my talk page. that's just plain rude. if you do not come up with some solution that involves them not having TWO IDENTICAL COPIES OF THE SAME WORTHLESS PAGE (incl merge node), i will revert them to the way i had them before. i have been as polite as i could possibly be in this instance. See also [[Fancruft]]. Have a nice day.
[avriette]: I just want to thank you so very very much for adding [[Rick Sternbach]]. After reading my user page, you may notice that I have a very strong \""deletionist\"" policy towards Star Trek (and Star Wars, And Power Rangers, etc) articles. When I saw that so much of Mr. Sternbach's and Mr. Okuda's work had been purloined and made into these articles, and yet nothing biographical on either of them, I was livid. You deserve a medal for correcting this. Thank you. Thank you.
[avriette]: ditto for [[Michael Okuda]]. Rock on.
[avriette]: The merge you did was done well. Thanks.
[avriette]: Thank you for your edit to [[50th Space Wing]]. I guess I was just busy reading all their documents to originally write that page, and it didn't occur to me that your way was much clearer. Frankly, I was feeling kind of bad for writing such a comprehensive page on what is inherently a fairly spooky organization. May I ask where you draw your USAF expertise from?
[avriette]: I'm not sure how I'd go about finding these. I'm not military, so I'm not sure how I would get ahold of them. It's not as if I can head to the local disa search engine and look for them. I noticed a couple of the above were published from Peterson, so I figured you might be able to obtain them. Best,
[avriette]: Can you have another look at the images listed on [[User talk:CJMylentz]]? I just noticed the image on [[Riki Rachtman]], which is clearly copyrighted (see http:\/\/www.rikirachtman.com\/). I don't see any notes saying that it is free for use here. <font size=\""-1\"">
[avriette]: First, your suggestion, above, to make \""program 437\"" [[program 437]] was a good one. The information I was able to find on the web was sufficient to get it featured in [[Wikipedia:Did you know|DYK]]. Neato. Also, I saw your edit on (the name escapes me) the NSA device. I was wondering whether you knew anything about the new quantum encryption devices that are presently on the market. They're limited to, I think, 1.5mbit, and they have to be direct-connected over fiber (repeaters would break the quantum entanglement). I saw a very good presentation on this at Supercomputing 05 in Seattle. Would you be interested in an article on the devices? <font size=\""-1\"">
[avriette]: Sometimes the line between \""military\"" and \""non-military\"" gets blurred. The presentation I saw at SC05 was from Magiq. It was really quite good. And, he mentioned that a certain organization in Maryland is using their products. So I'm not sure how much you'd consider it military, nor do I think it is really \""wide\"" use (especially because of that length-of-line restriction). However, \""in use\"" certainly applies. I'll have a look and put an article together. <font size=\""-1\"">

[avriette]: Hi, Provelt. I won't hold your LAMP usage against you. :) I was pondering [[Hideki Tojo]] today and happened upon one of the categories that makes wikipedia such a special place: [[:Category:Executed heads of state]]. I noticed that [[Nikolai Ceaucescu]] was absent from said list, and went to add him to the list. On so doing, I saw yet more executive mirth: [[:Category:Executed presidents]], [[:Category:Executed royalty]], and I am sure there are more lurking out there. Would it be worthwhile to just join all of these people into a larger category, such as the executed heads of state category? It seems to me that whether they were royalty, president, or whatever other title a head of state can have, is not exactly relevant to the fact that one day they were head of state, and the next day, they were wormfood. I see you're one of those very useful categorists (thank you, thank you), and I'd prefer to yield to your experience in this matter. ttfn, <b>...&nbsp;<\/b><span style=\""background-color: #11cbc4;width:52px;height:16px;font-size:12px;p{text-align:center}\"">

[Nuttah]: More likely than yes, not a certainty. The Met forecast says, given the same starting conditions, where we were last year will end up in a harsh winter every 1 year in 3 on average, the other 2 years will be better. A dictionary is not needed, this is basic GCSE maths.

NicholasTurnbull,False,"[NicholasTurnbull]: Firstly, Ausir, my apologies for removing it. I've removed the \""Report an error\"" link because I think it is bound to lead to lots of erroneous bug reports generated from users who don't understand how Wikipedia works. Also, it just presented the user with a blank edit screen to add a section to [[Wikipedia:Report an error]] without explaining what sort of thing the user should write there or when they should make a bug report. Thus, I think it is not a good idea to have it there; I think something better would be a good idea, however, perhaps a link to a page which explains what to do if you think you've found a bug. It probably works OK on the Polish Wikipedia due to a lower traffic volume, but I'm a bit apprehensive about having it on en. Best regards, --
[NicholasTurnbull]: Dear GTBacchus: Thank you for contacting me. The definition I use as to what userboxes are acceptable in userspace is based on the Arbcom ruling on the subject at [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration\/Tony Sidaway]] as \""polemic or inflammatory\""; I don't believe any \""This user opposes X\"" userboxes are acceptable, because they ''will'' give rise to conflict, but I don't see anything intrinsically wrong with \""This user supports X\"" or \""This user does not support X\"" simply because it is a statement of point of view versus being advocacy against something. This is more or less congruent with the T1 definition of \""divisive or inflammatory\"" also, although personally I don't believe userboxes should be deleted just because they represent a POV; it is more latitude of conflict I consider to be the primary factor in determining the suitability of a userbox. I hope this outlines my rationale a little more; please do let me know if you would like me to answer any further questions you may have on the subject. Best regards, --
[NicholasTurnbull]: '''Faith in the German solution'''. As I've outlined, I don't think that permitting opposition-related userboxes is the manner of solving this conflict, but I will follow your request and will permit the German solution project to run its course without interference from my administrative actions in the future, in the spirit of good-faith attempts to end conflict, and I hope you will accept my apologies should my actions to date have been eviscerating the good work you have been attempting to achieve through the project. I regret, perhaps, my principles of neutrality as regards statements of POV by user have extended too far - as I consider that we should, really, be working in a completely NPOV environment - and I appreciate you may well have a better grasp of the situation than I. I hope you have the best of success with the German solution despite my doubts as to its ability to mitigate the controversy, and thank you very much for taking the time to talk to me about this. Best regards, --
[NicholasTurnbull]: p.s. By the way, I have written a brief essay on my idea for more neutral wording of POV userboxes at [[Wikipedia:NPOV in userboxes]] (I don't think the title of the essay is really quite right, because it is more neutral representation of POV that I am aiming for, but I couldn't think of anything better at the time.) I would be most grateful for your input. Best regards, --

[NicholasTurnbull]: From our dialogue above, it is clear that you are trying to contribute constructively to Wikipedia, and so I felt it to be the best course of action to let you know how you can contribute without your material being removed. The other reason is that you can find yourself blocked from editing Wikipedia as a consequence of continued posting of material that does not conform to basic requirements. I thus hope that you will be able to help us make a better encyclopaedia, and work on producing relevant article content that is written in an encyclopaedic manner. I would suggest that you try working on existing articles rather than creating new ones to begin with, until you get a good sense of what is relevant to be included on Wikipedia and what isn't. I hope this may be of some assistance to you. Should you need any help regarding Wikipedia editing, please do let me know. Yours, --
[NicholasTurnbull]: Dear IBeatAnorexia: This is just a brief note to draw your attention to the policies [[Wikipedia:No personal attacks]] and [[Wikipedia:Civility]], in reference to [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Canthusus&diff=prev&oldid=116618277 this user talk page post] and [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Talk:Gray_Birch&diff=prev&oldid=116526731 this article talk page post]. In particular, one thing that alarmed me looking at these two posts is your use of \""fag\"" and \""gay admin\""; please be aware homophobia really will not be tolerated here on Wikipedia - and especially not by me. I understand, though, you may have used them merely as general derogative words, rather than with specific reference to sexuality. Either way, though, please be civil to people on Wikipedia - it really does cost nothing, and it makes a better editing environment for us all. This is also, saddeningly, the time when I must inform you that future personal attacks and\/or homophobic insults will result in a block from editing Wikipedia. Thank you very much. Yours, --
[NicholasTurnbull]: Dear IBeatAnorexia: Thank you for apologising; and, of course, I accept your apology. Everyone gets \""hot under the collar\"" sometimes, especially when frustrated; but please rest assured the message above was a warning only, and I do not generally block users from editing Wikipedia merely on the basis of a couple of ill-judged talk page postings. I always try to allow a wide margin of good faith ''within reason'', and it wasn't your anger which I took issue with - it was the unnecessary sexuality-related slurs, and the incivility. And so, as I have no reason to doubt the sincerity of your apology, I expect that you won't make such slurs again, and so there will be no problem in the future. Thank you again, and if you feel yourself getting frustrated over something, remember I am at your service should you require my assistance. Yours, --
[NicholasTurnbull]: Dear Paul: You're back here on the wiki! I'm thrilled. :-) I only just noticed that you've started editing again merely by chance. I did send you a rather strange e-mail to your (old?) address yesterday asking about your disappearance, but I should have checked your contribs first. Silly me! *slaps forehead* In which case, ignore it. How are you doing? It's absolutely ages since we last spoke - far, far too long ago. I myself have been away from WP for a while, owing to a lack of Internet access, and I think it probably did me good. I trust all has been going well for you? --
[NicholasTurnbull]: (Sorry for the rambling nature of this reply. I think I'm just excited that I've got to talk to you again. Really this probably should have gone in an e-mail instead of here on Wikipedia; but what the hell, I'm clicking \""Save page\"" anyway.) --
[NicholasTurnbull]: It is my personal view one should not close MfD discussions by basically ignoring the discussion and carrying out what you think is best, as it would otherwise render the whole object of MfD - to gain consensus, or to indicate a lack of it if it is not gained - entirely void, and make the outcome entirely a matter of arbitrary decision on the part of the closing administrator. I hope you can, at least, see my perspective that merely a cursory inspection of the discussion shows there is not a consensus to \""Esperanzify\"" nor delete the page. If this is your personal opinion, you are of course free to advance it; but you should not close an MfD on that basis. Of course, I am not going to fight whatever you wish to do instead, and I will stand clear of the MfD should you wish to carry out your own actions, as I am not in the habit of wheel-warring. Thank you very much for letting me know, and I do hope you don't consider me hopelessly obstinate for disagreeing. Cheers, --
[NicholasTurnbull]: In other words, what one is testing is whether there is consensus towards a particular point - you don't insert your own reasoning as a \""tie-breaker\"", as it were. If there is no consensus towards any side of the debate (which I think is evident from the discussion) it isn't acceptable to pre-empt this with your own decision making. This is how things on Wikipedia have always been run, I believe, and it isn't something one can circumvent merely because of one's own opinion - which was, at least, how it looked, and your assessment above of your view that the deletion advocates presented a stronger case has no relation to consensus. I am not trying to be argumentative nor unpleasant here, but I do feel you may not fully understand the manner in which Wikipedia precedent considers consensus to exist. Thanks a lot for listening to my rather long diatribe on the subject! Cheers, --
[NicholasTurnbull]: I sincerely regret having to take such action, as I would have hoped it would not come to this. However, as it stands, you leave me with little option other than to do so. Please take this as an opportunity to contribute in a sensible manner to these articles, and '''consider this your final warning'''. Thank you very much. Yours sincerely, --

[NicholasTurnbull]: Hey there Xavexgoem! I'm honoured to be nominated by such a luminary, and I am glad to confirm. --
[NicholasTurnbull]: Thanks, Jeannmb. I'm glad. There is still, however, much to be done; that the entire subject of NLP itself is glossed over is quite bizarre. There is actually no description whatsoever of NLP techniques and approaches. The article discusses in effect the ''diaspora'' around NLP, but not the actual subject. Whether more discussion of NLP methods and models should go in the main article or in a fork, I am not sure. At bare minimum, however, there should be some sort of summary, at least, to provide some context. For what it's worth, I know only quite little about NLP (except having once gone to an NLP practitioner with whom I had an extremely negative experience); but when it comes to the article, I accept nothing less than neutrality for both sides. Your expertise is extremely valuable and I look forward to your assistance in making further improvements. --
[NicholasTurnbull]: Please have a look at the mediation case page linked to above, and participate in the current stage of the mediation process if you wish.

If you have any questions or concerns relating to this dispute, the mediation, or the Mediation Cabal in general, please do let me know. Thank you very much. Best regards,
[NicholasTurnbull]: Thanks for clarifying. Since he's not provided any participation on the MedCab case thus far and not even shown any sort of willingness to enter mediation (I note his page says he is on a wikibreak), I will close this case without prejudice to you being able to file another MedCab request if you feel it is necessary in the future. --
[NicholasTurnbull]: Thanks for clarifying.

[NicholasTurnbull]: Thanks for your thoughts, Kingpin13. Please don't worry. I will investigate the dynamics of the RfC fully as this progresses and if it does indeed transpire that no further mediation is necessary (and the requesting parties have specified this), it will be either held or closed as such. However, I should say that the requesting individuals for the Mediation Cabal case are permitted to request the Mediation Cabal to look into mediating it; but please, don't be concerned this means I am instantly assuming a general agreement from RfC participants to have the Mediation Cabal mediate. If there is no consensus for mediation it will, as I said, be closed as such, or else the mediation will be confined to being between the parties that wish to mediate. Nobody is forced to participate in the Mediation Cabal process. --
[NicholasTurnbull]: I'm sort of between a rock and a hard place with this. The trouble is, the Mediation Cabal doesn't have a rule (unlike the MedCom) that says that all participants must sign agreement to mediation; therefore, I can't just put it on hold based on your objection to the request. The parties who have communicated on the page do have a right to have their case considered by a mediator and discussed. Arguably, also, it is not in fact up to me as a mediator to understand the dynamics of the case; it is up to the parties to discuss it amongst themselves, albeit in a structured (or semi-structured) fashion that produces more driving force than heat. I really do appreciate your concern and for all I know you may be right, but it would be remiss of me to suddenly put what appears to be an urgent request for assistance on hold simply because of your misgivings. If it is apparent that there is no mediation work to be done, or it would be harmful, I will terminate the mediation. --
[NicholasTurnbull]: Alright, how about a compromise. I will post on the MedCab page to say that a view has been put forward that consensus has already been reached as per the talk page for the subsequent actions to take on the RfC, and state that until this has been investigated fully the mediation will be kept open, but no direct involvement with the RfC talk page should occur nor any presentation of proposals for action to take on the RfC. --
[NicholasTurnbull]: Perhaps, in which case, there may be a case to be made for this going to [[WP:RFM]] if it's mediated at all by a process rather than the MedCab. (The only trouble with that is, ironically, you'd probably get me again.) But, are you aware that it is general Wikipedia precedent that users cannot select their mediators (it is specifically in the mediation policy that they can't), no more they can select the members of the ArbCom who decide their case? If there is a contingent of editors who wish to apply to one of the [[WP:DR]] processes on their own steam aside from a page discussion, they aren't doing anything wrong to request dispute resolution. --
[NicholasTurnbull]: Hm. Alright, OK. It does seem like there is insufficient consensus for the mediation process to proceed at this stage. Thank you for informing me. --[[User:NicholasTurnbull|Nicholas'''Turnbull''']] &#124; [[User_talk:NicholasTurnbull|(talk)]] 23:40, 3 April 2011 (UTC) Corrected --

[NicholasTurnbull]: I've received no response whatsoever from {{user|Avraham}}. Unfortunately, it does seem that Avraham has failed to indicate acceptance of mediation within a reasonable timeframe. I hope, therefore, you won't mind me closing the case. If at a future time Avraham does wish to enter mediation with you and there continues to be a dispute that you'd like our help with, feel free to file another request. I hope you'll let me know if there's anything I can do for you. --
[NicholasTurnbull]: In fact, there was [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAvraham&action=historysubmit&diff=422552473&oldid=422177094 a response] on the user's talk page that I didn't see, which is an explicit refusal of mediation. --
[NicholasTurnbull]: Yes, I reckon you're right. There used to be more [[WP:RS]] refs available online than there are now, and those that would meet RS criteria are now either dead or archived material; he seems to have kind of receded in terms of stuff to reference and I can't think of any means where notability could be adequately asserted in the sense of [[WP:BAND]]\/[[WP:BIO]]. Whilst it's likely now academic, what is very odd is the article history shows as though I'm the article creator when I'm certain I wasn't &mdash; yet I can't find any [[WP:REVDEL]] or [[WP:CP]] that might have happened, and there's no REVDELed revisions (maybe oversighted?). Not that it really matters, I suppose. --"
Mason.Jones,False,"[Mason.Jones]: I just restored the final 2010 U.S. Census population in the article \""New York City\"": 8,175,133. Although this figure has been disputed by Mayor Bloomberg and others, this is the official population for New York until the dispute is resolved with the Census Bureau. Until then, the final 2010 U.S. Census figure or later Census Bureau estimate should be used. Other figures (2009 estimate, City Council \""disputed\"" figures, Chamber of Commerce estimates, etc.) aren't considered valid in Wikipedia.
[Mason.Jones]: The official 2010 Census figures for U.S. cities were just announced March 21 of this year; these appear everywhere in Wikipedia now (ex., List of U.S. Cities by Population). Perhaps the figures you got for 2010 are from the Census Bureau's 2009 estimate, released last summer 2010? Anyway, that estimate was higher and it's one reason the mayor and City Council aren't happy with the final count. But it is official. You'll find the final 2010 counts by logging onto factfinder2.census.gov and clicking 2010 Census.
[Mason.Jones]: Your edit\/comment about Nashville's 2010 population is erroneous. Final 2010 US Census figures have been available since March, and these now appear in ''all'' articles throughout Wikipedia (2009 US Census estimates are invalid). Nashville's population, defined by the Census Bureau as Nashville-Davidson ''minus'' all incorporated towns inside Nashville-Davidson, is 601,222, and that is reflected under [[List of United States cities by population]]; other consolidated cities (Jacksonville, FL and Augusta, GA) are treated the same way. The 601,222 figure for Nashville is official with the Census Bureau and will appear in all almanacs and encylopedias this year. Inflating this figure is POV\/boosterism and runs counter to Wikipedia's rules. You'll note that Atlanta was estimated in 2009 to have well over 540,000 people. The actual 2010 Census showed 420,000, and Atlantans have had to accept the official population. Why can't Nashvillians and Tennesseans do the same?"

[Adamdaley]: I understand what you mean.  I would like to point out that it should start with the WikiProject sections, whatever the subject is to make the banner invalid when shortened to \""WP subject here\"".  Yes, some do become invalid once shortened to \""WP subject here\"".  That way, the \""users\"" who are trying to make it appear to be \""WikiProject subject here\"" much easier job.  It should not just be individuals being warned, it should be a \""global\"" Wikipedia change to all WikiProject banners.  No offence is intended, only giving a valid reason why WikiProject can be shortened to \""WP\"" and really it has nothing to do with me.  It's the \""WP subjects here\"" and Wikipedia itself, otherwise why can they be shortened?  Feedback and a change in policy would be appreciated.  I do understand what you mean, honestly.
[Adamdaley]: Let's say that the \""Terrorism\"" portal was (for example) \""WikiProject Terrorism|class=|importance=\"" banner, why would they abbreviate it to \""WP Terrorism|class=|importance=\"", if it should be the first stated example?  The second would be show up as invalid on a preview of the page before saving.  In my opinion, if the committee, board, adminstrators, council of Wikipedia is trying to make the \""WikiProject Terrorism|class=|importance=\"" (example) for all portals or subjects covered, then shouldn't they and as well contributors (regular users) have their opinion heard?

KarenAnn,False,"[KarenAnn]: It's not vandalism. It's someone who quoted a long message on my talk page (about 31 lines long) in his message to me. Therefore, the same long message (31 or so lines) is on my page twice. Means a lot of scrolling, but maybe that's not excuse enough.  Maybe I could edit it? Like say \""See above message from &&&&& above\"" and then leave his message there intact. In other words, remove the long quote from a message that can be seen not far above his on my talk page.
[KarenAnn]: So are you saying that you fixed whatever was wrong with it? (It's been a long day.) Just running through your talk page with the limited energy I have left, you seem lawyerly, so I take it the answer is YES. Very interesting case, to me anyway.
[KarenAnn]: I just looked at the page and it looks very good now. Don't you think the expert tag can be removed? Do you think it needs further work or can it be released?
[KarenAnn]: I don't know how to access my page to change its name, as someone as redirected it. (I saw that on my Watchlist.)
[KarenAnn]: Thank you so much! How did you find it? What is the method in a situation like that?
[KarenAnn]: When you say the redirection page, do you mean the Disambiguation page? And if I edited that page, how would the Wiki know how to find the renamed page (since I wouldn't be able to get to the page to rename it)? And where is it in the meantime -- it must be on a list somewhere to delete or something? It's all very mysterious.
[KarenAnn]: Well, none of that seems to work as you say, but thanks for helping me out on this one. One other article a while ago, I really did lose -- it was never found, so I get a little uptight. But thanks! (I have read all that redirect stuff and everything else I can find about the problems, but I guess I'm missing a screw.)
[KarenAnn]: Is there a list of categories somewhere?
[KarenAnn]: Could you tell me which particular article you are referring to -- has I have done hundreds of tagging in the wikify backlog in the last few days and I have already been using the source you referred me to? As far as I know, I have never substituted a tag. In fact, I don't know quite what you mean.
[KarenAnn]: It's very intimidating, violates the policies that Wikipedia states it has, and gives me dread. I had no idea that schools were a hot-button issue. I feel this whole posting is increasingly  showing bad faith. What more can I do? Is there a place I can appeal to?
[KarenAnn]: P.S. If I am being oversensitive and too wimpy, let me know. I'm trying to get tougher -- I just didn't know people could be so openly mean.
[KarenAnn]: I wish you would, as I think such experiences drive well-motivated novices away from Wikipedia.  And I promised on the [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\/Kent-Meridian High School]] that I will never touch a school page again, and I mean it. I just was clueless, else I never would have stepped into that minefield.
[KarenAnn]: P.S. I'm not going to nominate any articles for deletion again.  I have withdrawn from many articles and activities that I used to enjoy (like Cuban-related articles after the Teemu episode and all the subsequent arguing that is still going on at the expense of any progress on the article). I'm too academic and over-educated, and not the right kind of person to be involved with Wikipedia, I think.
[KarenAnn]: Can't resist. Not a school though but an obvious promo. And when I was checking it upon completion, someone had already agreed. The school thing was a fluke. Almost every one I have nominated has been deleted, except for \""petal pumping\"" which I thought was a hoax but turns out to be a bonofide foot fetish, as was explained to me -- but politely. No one got upset!
[KarenAnn]: P.S. I didn't mean to be flippant. I have learned never to nominate schools, bands or musical performers,  generalized last names, and probably a few other catagories. I usually stick to adverts and try to get them on a copy vio first -- so I am taking in information and becoming more adept, I hope.
[KarenAnn]: I thought the nominations were for discussion and information-sharing. But I have been intimidated by that experience and will not BE BOLD.
[KarenAnn]: have an email address as you describe.
[KarenAnn]: O.K. I works now. A box got unchecked accidently, apparently.
[KarenAnn]: Also, you mentioned watching the newly-created articles list. How do you do that? The closest I can come is watching the Recent changes list. Newly-created articles list sounds really interesting.
[KarenAnn]: [[Help:Patrolled edit]] - do you know anything about this aspect of Recent Changes? I read it but don't understand it. (I'm not a computer person.)
[KarenAnn]: Those pages should be removed so others won't be as idiotic as I was and try to go to that site. (His other pages were attack pages. He puts in a person's name and then writes adolescently bad things about them.)
[KarenAnn]: Thanks! It was the unlinked external link that caused the problem. (Of course, I had to try it.) I had put a speedy delete tag on his attack articles -- but I didn't know what to put on this one. The speedy delete process is an on-again off-again thing. Can't count on it."

James500,False,"[James500]: Thank you for pointing out that the infobox did not say what the status of the above Act was. I have put it right.
[James500]: Can I take it that you agree that I have interpreted this guideline correctly?
[James500]: I think that you should not place that tag on this article again as the the links cannot be described as ambiguous and there is no other obvious place they can point, as merger would be impractical because there are too many statutes that have [[short title]]s (perhaps a number of tens of thousands worldwide) and would probably defeat the point of the lists which is have subject-oriented lists that are not confined to particular jurisdictions and dates.
[James500]: I have removed the CSD tag you placed on this article. CSD A1 does not apply or no longer applies because there is sufficient context to identify the subject of the article, which is a [[studio album]] by [[Jin (rapper)|Jin]] the name of which is \""100 Grand Jin'\"". Please let me know if you think that there are other grounds on which the article could be deleted, or if you think that I have made an error.
[James500]: It is not obvious to me that the information in the infobox is \""trivial\"".
[James500]: CSD A1 was not applicable to this article (which has now been recreated by the original editor). It was quite obvious that the subject of the article was the regeneration of [[Salford Quays]]. The only speedy deletion criteria that I can think of that might apply to the article is A10.
[James500]: A10 might have been applicable to [[1 Information]]. A1 was certainly not applicable. It only applies where it is impossible to identify the subject of the article.
[James500]: I have noticed that you moved the page [[Statutes concerning forcible entries and riots confirmed]] to this location. I have moved it back because the source of the new name is unclear.
[James500]: I have noticed the edit you recently made. This Act ''is'' an Act of the Parliament of England. Neither the fact that that Parliament has been superseded, nor the fact that it has been extended to other jurisdictions, changes what it ''is''."

[Mareino]: I agree with Cynical. I never objected to any Wiki policy, or felt that I was being treated unfairly, until CSD T1 was handed down. There are many policies that I disagree with (such as allowing IP edits to take effect immediately), but I feel like my opinion would be heard if I wanted to engage in a debate about it. The march against userboxes is against the consensual spirit of Wikipedia -- it's admins enforcing their beliefs about which userboxes are \""bad\"" and which are \""good\"" on the rest of us.--[[User:Mareino|M]][[User_talk:Mareino|<font color=\""orange\"">@<\/font>]][[User:Mareino|r]][[Special:Contributions\/Mareino|<font color=\""orange\"">\u0113<\/font>]]
[Mareino]: I will accept your edit if I cannot convince you, but I do feel that I should explain that I used the word \""tenuous\"", to which you objected, because I have read reports concluding that the Finnic and Ugric languages are not in fact descended from a common ancestor.  Therefore, they would have a tenuous connection rather than a distant divergence.

Michellecrisp,False,"[Michellecrisp]: the Hamersley article I encountered before editing was very excessive in detail containing verbose language, and kind of detail like listing the scientific name of every single bottlebrush found on a plain (I've never ever seen that in a locality article). to be absolutely honest, and I patrol around a lot of locality articles, it should not be a featured article nor good article, because it is not encyclopaedic and written verbosely in parts instead of being concise and to the point and it mixes a lot of very localised non notable information amongst the main text.
[Michellecrisp]: as with most things, if you search long enough you can dig up more information till the cows come home. notability and relevance are primary reasons for including more content. examples like this show unencyclopaedic writing [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Hamersley%2C_Western_Australia&diff=142648987&oldid=142648847] everywhere in Australia uses the same voting system! or do people really care about the scientific name of every plant species in every suburb? I think not. This is verbose too [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Hamersley%2C_Western_Australia&diff=142648770&oldid=142648577] if there is no mention of private schools one can safely assume there aren't any. on the same token, it might as well have said Hamersley has no universities or medical research facilities.
[Michellecrisp]: You said \"" We can't assume readers will know the systems and practices of Australia\"" then '''every''' locality entry should include that info. or perhaps that people drive on left hand side of the road. my point is that info for a locality should be '''specific''' to that locality. Using your argument, I should have not made this delete today [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Roma%2C_Queensland&diff=prev&oldid=142605682]. you should see that this line should not be added to every locality in Australia where wool is mentioned.
[Michellecrisp]: A general comment on how an external factor is influencing a local industry is fine. but back to my original point. if someone wanted to know more about the voting system at state level in Hamersley all they needed to do was click on [[Western Australian Legislative Assembly]]. that is what links are for.
[Michellecrisp]: I've explained that my issue is not necessarily verbose or the fact that everything is citated, it is the importance and notability of these facts. see article discussion, something should not be added just because you can citate it. thanks for your comments

[TreyHarris]: The issue, as I understand it, is that small references sections in small articles are typically presented at full size, whereas large references sections are presented in smaller sizes.

Can the proper CW templates be restored, please? Thank you. <font color=\""maroon\"" face=\""Myriad Web\"">'''
[Mrschimpf]: Did you even read what I had to say? I am keeping your additions, but I removed the empty entries in the infoboxes you needlessly edited because they will never, ever be filled in and waste bytespace that can better be utilized in the article. Please do not do this again against the consensus of WP:TVS, as we have already told you multiple times not to do this. I have reverted your edits adding the empty information, and if they are reverted I will be seeking administrative action against you. Thank you. <font face=\""Myriad Web\"">'''
[Mrschimpf]: Then just add those four lines and move on; there was nothing wrong with the boxes at all where you need to reorganize the whole thing and add empty text. It is organized quite fine and doesn't need any changes. Also I find the BIA links uninformative and basically giving the same information listed in the article; it's redundant. Besides that, it's a commercial database, unlike the FCC and Radio Locator (which although it is a commercial operation does provide plenty of information). <font face=\""Myriad Web\"">'''
[Mrschimpf]: So do the websites of the television stations themselves, which are usually updated much more often if there's a change than BIA, which is inherently subject to not being updated if a change is made. We don't need to link to every bit of detail for a television station. Keep it general, keep it brief, keep it concise. We're an encyclopedia first and foremost, and we should keep it that way. <font face=\""Myriad Web\"">'''
[Mrschimpf]: As for a station which doesn't have a website; the address can be found through the FCC link, or a simple Google search. These days only the smallest of stations do not have a website. If you do want to use the BIA links though, first, '''build a consensus''' with TVS editors and see if it will work. <font face=\""Myriad Web\"">'''
[Mrschimpf]: You talk to us on TVS and bring up the BIA links and see if anyone wants them added, not just put them in without a discussion. The FCC templates were added through the same collaboration, and it should be no different if you want to add this one to station articles. <font face=\""Myriad Web\"">'''

[Mrschimpf]: I turned this into a speedy delete; it's already been [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\/Spells of Wizards of Waverly Place|deleted]] [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\/List of Wizards of Waverly Place spells|twice]] via the AfD process, and it's obvious this user will not comply with the decision.

[Mrschimpf]: I decided to remove the tourism and history sites (the latter doesn't look official at all or from at the very least the county historical society), but keep the police site; I was wavering towards doing that in the last couple days. As for the other issue I was patient with them in the beginning, but their push for self-promotion of themselves in all venues here (including this [[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation\/AsherHeimermannTheFirst|AfC attempt about themselves]] three months ago) tried my patience, and I think they even had a mentor here before they gave up on him. To me, unless they can abide by the rules and stops their self-promotion (or as in [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=WSHS_(FM)&oldid=426418185 this edit by the IP], claims their group bought the school district radio station at a lowball price), I cannot welcome their contributions. <font face=\""Myriad Web\"">'''

Aldwinteo,False,"[Aldwinteo]: To move this discussion forward constructively, it wld be easier & logical to rename the above article to \""Kent Ridge\"" & keep its content intact with just minor modifications on its intro. I disagree to split the article into 2 standalone parts as it will become a 'waterdown' version in content for both.

I think the most likely ways for FLs on the main page proposal to get derailed is for people to start debating over whether the FC format is the best, whether we should do it daily like TFA or POTD, whether we should wait until later, etc. All of these are just votes against.  In all likelihood, people who want FLs on the main page will either want to do it similar to my way (democratically) or similar to TFA (autocratically).  I am just calling for a vote of persons who want to get going democratically. If they vote for my procedure it can be tweaked like anything else at WP.  I think votes to wait are just votes against us being on the mainpage or votes against a democratic procedure since we are so far beyond where TFA was when they started.

EH101,False,"[EH101]: Hi Bzuk. I'm always around, taking care of links between the English language project and the Italian one. As you probably remember I do not dare to contribute to en.wiki without well established agreements and preliminary tests. At the moment I am working on several it.wiki aviation featured articles that are submitted to the \""de-featured status\"" inquiry. In fact, our standards are getting tougher and each and every important sentence must have a citation footnote. Results are examples like [[:it:Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]] with 117 footnotes and so on. During the \""citation analisys\"" process, I have seen that linked en.wiki articles I am looking in the same time, sometimes do not have citations notes where I was able to retrieve them on it.wiki identical sentence and, as I am often quoting English language sources, it could be very easy to transfer my verification work on the English articles. In these days, as an example, I am improving [[it:Disastro di Tenerife]] article, which is gradually embedding detailed citation footnotes and some other images I am drawing for the special occasion. I am relying on the official reports, available on the web, I cannot see cited in the en.wiki article counterpart paragraphs. Question (a very very old one): which kind of citation method do you consider the most ?  On it.wiki, I am easily adopting the Italian version of the [[Wikipedia:Citing_sources\/Further_considerations#Using_the_shortened_footnote_template|shortened footnote template]] (look at the B-52 article as an example). What do you think of it and could it be considered compliant with the aviation project citation guidelines ? This time we are talking of possible contributions to well established articles and I consider this a sensible issue. Your opinion will be highly appreciated as always in these years. --

Hurricanehink,False,"[Hurricanehink]: Well, if 2006 is as active or fairly active, I personally would be fine with having an article for each storm. If some TV shows can have articles for each episode, then I don't see the harm in having an article for all future Atlantic tropical cyclones.
[Hurricanehink]: Whoops, sorry, it was the first thing in the morning after I woke up. I responsed on the 2005 talk page.
[Hurricanehink]: I would say wait a bit, but the voting is basically in favor for it.
[Hurricanehink]: Don't worry, I figured it too. I would say wait until the vote is over, and then, if those who voted no are still against it, ask each one why they are against it and what is wrong with having it. After that, ask on the 2005 talk page for any possible alternatives, and reiterate that it is only for TD's. After those who still oppose it are still against, then you can request mediation. However, I won't be here for long to help. I'm going on vacation on Wednesday, and won't be back for 2 weeks, so you should ask someone else. Good luck!
[Hurricanehink]: Thanks, I'll be sure to enjoy it! I'm just glad you were on my side from the beginning. You've been a big help, especially since I thought I was too bold to begin with bringing it up. Luckily you are a good swimmer, I suppose :)
[Hurricanehink]: Cool. Good luck with the battle.
[Hurricanehink]: Thanks. I'll check it out later.
[Hurricanehink]: Not sure. I'm sure you'll find someone.
[Hurricanehink]: Alright, good luck with that.
[Hurricanehink]: Are you having any luck with anything? Not much seems to be happening. How's this for a proposal. Since the list of 2005 storms is now a FL, that should not be touched at all. What should happen in the future is this; have only important storms in the season summary (Dennis, Emily, Katrina, Rita, Vince, Wilma, Alpha, and Zeta) with brief descriptions (1 paragraph at most), leave the list alone, and still have articles for every storm. This way, the information will only be replicated twice instead of having it superflously on the 2005 page.
[Hurricanehink]: Feel better! Alpha should definetely be mentioned because it was the one that finished the names, though Wilma broke the storm record. Yea, that sounds good for the season summary.
[Hurricanehink]: My vacation is going great! Plenty of sunshine, relaxation, and places where I can edit Wikipedia ;) Good work with the 2005 articles, and good luck finishing the rest of them with the prior formatting. The articles' format works the way you said it. Other stuff could be called Trivia, and retirement should be in the aftermath section. I thinking forecasting shcould be a sub-category of preparations. Everything else works.
[Hurricanehink]: Good find. But..... the reports are only useful for the more damaging hurricanes. In the past, they rarely go into detail for lesser storms; the 2003 report gives little information in Mexico on the effects of Erika or Larry. However, Odette has a lot of information, enough that I am considering giving it an article. It all depends on the location, and unfortunately, storms like Bret, Gert, and Jose will probably get little mention there. On the other hand, Bermuda typically gives great detail for the storms that impact the country, so that will work well for Harvey and Nate.
[Hurricanehink]: I doubt A class is attainable for a storm like Irene. You need a lot of info, but it can't be redundant. Epsilon has forecasting as a separate section because that was the reason for the article at the time. Irene had no real reason, so forecasting should be part of the storm history (unless the concensus is different). The end is in sight, but not quite there yet. Yea, the southern hemisphere seasons has bugged me for a while, but I made a personal pledge I wouldn't do much there (I did 1492-1890 in the Atlantic, nearly all of the WPAC, and all of the north Indian, and didn't want to waste any more wiki time on seasons). However, that sounds like a good idea. I would split it into two- Southwest Indian as one and Southeast\/Australia\/South Pacific as the other. The only problem with that is the naming. [[2005-2006 Southeast Indian Ocean and South Indian Ocean cyclone season]]? What about South Indian and South Pacific, with, say, 130\xba East as the dividing marker?
[Hurricanehink]: Good job on B class, and good point about the southern hemisphere. I forgot about the Australian scale. Well, a Southwest article and an Australian\/South Pacific article works, but, at the most, only back to 2000, I would guess.
[Hurricanehink]: I don't think all the way back is necessary, at least not now. A 3 way split is not needed, either. Just the 2 way split should be fine from 2000 to the future.
[Hurricanehink]: Good luck.
[Hurricanehink]: Finally someone gets that! Up until relatively recently, most storm articles only had a storm history and a 2 sentence impact. The main problem with us Wicanepedians, myself included in the past, was they created an article and didn't go into much detail. Most retired storms, including Floyd, Georges, Gloria, David, and Mitch, all had very little. My plate is full, as well, trying to better every retired hurricane article to at least B class, if not A class. All I can say is great find. Hopefully Storm05, as well as other users will continue adding to some older articles.
[Hurricanehink]: Just to let you know, I didn't necessarily mean you. I'm just a little frustrated that most users don't care much for older articles. Thanks and good job for all the work you've been doing. We really need more Wicanepedians (yea, I liked the name when I thought of it) that will do some major work. I looked at Lee, but I'm not so sure if it can be B class. I don't know. You should ask someone else. I personally hate to do assessments, mainly because I don't know the objective criteria and that my standards are always too high or too low, if that makes any sense.
[Hurricanehink]: Yea, completely right. Maybe you should ask someone for some help. 27 storms is quite a daunting task. I'd help, but my policy is to stay away from 2005, and I have to get back to my old policy :) Perhaps you should ask Jdorje on the assessments? He is a strong Wicanepedian and always knows what's best in terms of the technological setup.
[Hurricanehink]: OK, as long as you are OK with it. I know the feeling of doing a huge task without anyone's help (List of Atlantic hurricane seasons, List of WPAC seasons, List of NI seasons), so just be sure that if you get overwhelmed, there are plenty of us who can bail you out :) Yea, the NHC has a lot of interesting quotes. I especially like Epsilon's.
[Hurricanehink]: LoL, no way. They're mine! :) I'm sure you can find plenty of interesting quotes from this season... plenty. Good to know you're reassured, and have fun.
[Hurricanehink]: That is extremely weird. You should ask around. Maybe an admin? I'm sorry I can't help sometimes, but I'm not too good with the techincal stuff.
[Hurricanehink]: LOL, no problem. A class, ideally, is just short of FA status. Things it may be missing are pictures, or sometimes A classes are too long. Irene, in my opinion, is nowhere near A class. A long storm history should have no indication on the assessment, but because forecasting is also in there, it is a B class. Perhaps we should have examples for each class? I'll bring that up on the Wikiproject page.
[Hurricanehink]: Good, glad I could explain. I brought up the discussion on the Wikiproject, so hopefully no one else will be confused. I'll double check the five you worked on. They could be B classes by now.
[Hurricanehink]: Just so you know, I added some major information to the Arlene article, so that's one less storm you'll do.
[Hurricanehink]: Grr, I hate when storms do that. I don't know, ask someone else. It was late when I added that in.
[Hurricanehink]: OK, that works. Copyediting is a little annoying, but it's needed. That's a good goal, getting all 2005 storms to B class, and I repeat, good luck. I know I said I try to stay out of the 2005 season, but when I was referring to that, I meant operationally. Now that the season's over, it's no longer \""new\"", and I'll work on that like just like other seasons.
[Hurricanehink]: Cool. About the pic, you should ask an admin, but I think it's public domain. You have to use the scissors icon and copy and paste the picture if it is in fact PD. If you want, I'll do it.
[Hurricanehink]: LOL, my school work has dropped to about 0. In fact, it's been pretty low all year because I'm a senior. However, it is a very useful link for storm images. Too bad it only goes back to 2000, and it is really time consuming. Oh well. Good luck to you with your school work. By the way, great job with 2005. Irene turned out well, and I am surprised it got to FA. Best of luck finishing the work, and I look forward to your future work.
[Hurricanehink]: Ooh, you're from Europe, are you? Cool! Luckily you never have to deal with the storms up close and personal. Yea, way too much tedium with the images, though you can probably unleash it on someone else. If anything is ever too much, feel free to ask someone. I'm happy to give you some help. You've progressed well over the last few weeks (months?). Thanks for the kind words, as well. Maybe we could have the Tropical Cyclone Wikipedian of the month? It could appear on the Wikiproject home page. We should recognize the people who have made the project as awesome as it is.
[Hurricanehink]: True, but it's rare, at least. A Brit, are ya? That's cool! :) You're probably right with the non-Atlantic basins, especially in the Southern Hemisphere. For example, I just checked a date at random (February 5, 2002), and found [http:\/\/modis-atmos.gsfc.nasa.gov\/IMAGES\/MOD02\/GRANULE\/2002_02_05\/036.1245.rgb143.jpg this extratropical\/subtropical storm] in the South Atlantic. Nowhere else could you get an image like that. Of course, you have to get lucky. Cyclone Vance was hitting Australia on the same day, but, [http:\/\/modis-atmos.gsfc.nasa.gov\/IMAGES\/MOD02\/GRANULE\/2002_02_05\/036.0250.rgb143.jpg in this image], it is left-biased and you don't get the entire storm, at least as opposed to [http:\/\/www.osei.noaa.gov\/Events\/Tropical\/IndOcean\/2002\/TRCchris036_N6.jpg this image]. It has potential, and we'll see where it leads.
[Hurricanehink]: Nice pix! Yea, Katrina is off-centered, but for that image, I think it works. It shows its future path towards Louisiana, and there's no real need to have Florida in the pic (it already passed it). Still, though, the system does have its problems. On Camille, yea, the 901 is unofficial. I seriously doubt it would be downgraded to a Category 4... Maybe (low chance) at landfall but the 905 is probably close to being correct. I really wish the HURDAT people would go faster. They're only at 1930 and they have 70 years left.
[Hurricanehink]: Great... (insert expletive). I would love to help, but... (tries to come with an excuse), I don't like the 2005 articles. Yea, that's it. Seriously though, I prefer to write new information. I really don't know how to go from B or GA class to FA class. I just know how to go from Start to FA. I'll see what I can do in the coming weeks. We have some time, as I just put Claudette up for FAC. That should be about a week or two before ending (whether it passes or fails). After that, Katrina should be ready... hopefully.
[Hurricanehink]: Well, [http:\/\/translate.google.com\/translate?hl=en&sl=es&u=http:\/\/www.meteored.com\/ram\/numero34\/katrina.asp&prev=\/search%3Fq%3D%2522Huracan%2BKatrina%2522%2BCuba%2B-Wilma%2B-Rita%2B-v%25C3%25ADctimas%2Blluvia%2B-1981%26hl%3Den%26lr%3D%26rls%3DDVXB,DVXB:2005-30,DVXB:en here's a start] to the Cuba section. The storm dropped over 12 inches of rain in northwestern Cuba.
[Hurricanehink]: What exuses???? :) Hey, you signed up for the job, so you gotta finish it. Come to think of it, we shouldn't have to deal with this. There's enough Katrina people around that they should do it. There really should be a Katrina Wikiproject, or Sub-project, just to organize the dearth of information. Those people probably know the storm better than we do (hopefully, but you never know), and probably have the patience to work through the sub-articles. If not, I suppose I'll try and help. Good work so far.
[Hurricanehink]: I doubt anyone would care. Those sub-sections work. To mix Cuba and Bahamas, you could to [[Greater Antilles]]. Caribbean is a little misleading. You could do \""Southeast United States\"" for Alabama, Georgia, and Florida. I'm not sure if there's enough for Canada. If there is, then have fun, but if not, then Canada could be put with other US states. Then, it could be retitled, Other North America. Have fun!
[Hurricanehink]: Probably, but it is the off-season. It's not hurricane time, so not too many people care.
[Hurricanehink]: If you're interested, [http:\/\/www.floridadisaster.org\/eoc\/eoc_Activations\/Katrina05\/Reports\/ here's] some emergency reports from Florida for Katrina.
[Hurricanehink]: Ah, ok. Impact should be 2 paragraphs minimum for a relatively major area. Florida and Cuba should probably be combined, as I doubt there's enough info for just a Cuba section. I don't know. Maybe ask on the talk page.
[Hurricanehink]: OK. Sorry I can't be more helpful, but school is getting a little busy with finals. You do not want to see me without Wikipedia ;) Yea, the feud is a little annoying... I tried telling Hurricanecraze that you don't own articles, but I'm not sure if he is listening. It would be good for an RFA, but I don't care too much to become an admin. It would probably have too much pressure. I just like to edit hurricane articles, really.
[Hurricanehink]: Are you serious? Grr... I just saw the tag and thought it was appropriate. Near the image, it says Library of Congress, without any specific copyright information. In the back of the book under bibliography, there is a source from a session in Congress. It says Papers and Illistrations on an Interim Survey of Atlantic Coast of Souhern New Jersey and Delaware, published by the Department of the Army. However, there's no mention specificly of the 1944 storm. There are numerous other sources in the bibliography, but none of them say where the image was from. In other words, there's no explicit way of knowing if this is PD or not. Also, I had no idea that a Featured List would be so much work than a featured article. I've greatly contributed to 4 featured articles, and none were as hard as this! :)
[Hurricanehink]: I doubt there's a way to find out. There's no way of contacting the authors of the book, as the book was written in 1993. There's nothing of the Vegabond Hurricane, either. There's also none of parelling hurricanes from the book, though possibly online. However, not many parelling hurricanes have images from New Jersey, so that probably doesn't help much. For the last thing, I never considered it, though I suppose I could. However, it would take a while, as the book is broken up at places. For example, the 1944 hurricane is a good 20 pages long, though the information I took was scattered. Is that necessary? If it is, it'll have to wait, as school is starting to interfere with my Wikitime.
[Hurricanehink]: I have a lot of other hurricane projects I would like to get done, so I suppose the NJ canes article is fine without it for now. However, you made a good point about future FL's. I will do that in the future if I ever attempt a list again. It does get hard to find the sources again... I know as well.
[Hurricanehink]: 
[Hurricanehink]: Hey! ;) Something like a newsletter sounds like a good idea. That could also feature the member of the month idea we've been talking about, as well as article statistics, a general todo, and a FA todo list (listing storms that should become FA's and what's left to do with them). There could be a storm of the month (which would be voted on and then have a summary). That has a lot of potential. Since it was your idea, you should suggest it. I'd support it.
[Hurricanehink]: Also, new articles could be mentioned there. It's too late for June, but we should get thinking about July before it's too late (sometimes people here procrastinate a bit, myself included).
[Hurricanehink]: One more thing. I notice you expanded your todo list back to 2003. Would you want to do all storms for both of those seasons? I would gladly help. As you've already seen, I'm working on 2004, with Alex, Bonnie, and Matthew all redone. If both of us worked on it, it wouldn't take too long to go through Charley, Frances, Gaston, Ivan, and Jeanne. After that, making articles for Danielle, Earl, Hermine, Karl, Lisa, Nicole, and Otto shouldn't be too bad.
[Hurricanehink]: OK, I wasn't sure what that was, but OK. That's fine on your position on the anti- all articles. Take your time finishing 2005. Yea, Ophelia is probably going to be a fun one.... right. Just to let you know, I brought up the newsletter idea on the Wikiproject page.
[Hurricanehink]: That makes perfect sense. I have one of those in my mind, and it's amazing how much still needs to be done. Basically, all work now is on Wikiproject: Tropical cyclones Version 2.0. The first version was the rough version of the retired storms, and the yearly databases. That's how I view it, at least. It does seem useful, but not in its current form with just the letters :P J\/k. I'm sure you'll get around to filling it in. For the all articles, even 1998 is probably too far back. For all storms, 2003 is probably the limit, though all landfalling storms could go back to around 1998, with all U.S. landfalling storms back further to around 1992, IMO. Yea, the table makes good sense for its purpose. Also, don't forget to include [[1952 Groundhog Day Tropical Storm]] and the [[1991 Halloween Nor'easter]] on the unnamed storms part.
[Hurricanehink]: Wow, that's a lot of todo! True, Irene standard articles could probably be made back to then, but they would be a little boring, IMO. Assuming we did go back to 1998 (which would be interesting to do), there would be Alex, Ivan, Jeanne, Karl, Lisa, Nicole, Cindy, Emily, Alberto, Chris, Ernesto, Nadine, Felix, Lorenzo, Noel, Dolly, Josephine, Danny, Kate, Nicholas, Peter, Danielle, Karl (2004), Lisa (2004), Nicole (2004), and Otto would have to be done that did not have impact on land. The rest could have at least some sort of impact section. That is not that bad. That is only 26, of which 8 are back to 2003. 2003 might not be the limit, come to think of it. Ivan, Jeanne, and Karl all could have a records section (4 hurricanes at once). Emily has plenty of bogus discussions, including one forecast of a 100 mph hurricane in the Leeward Islands. Alberto could have a records section (longevity). Nicholas had some impact after the storm dissipated. Peter could have records. 1998 is actually conceivable. That could be a long-term project, but for now we have enough of what needs to be done. We still need to get all 2003 and 2004 articles to B class before we should think about having all articles.
[Hurricanehink]: True. When I said we, I meant the project. That could work on the Wikipage as a constant reminder of what needs to be done. I tried a numerical version of the data, so the more reminders of how much work there is ahead of us, the better.
[Hurricanehink]: Very true. Very good idea of yours.
[Hurricanehink]: This is from Tropical Storm Emily's 8th Discussion, located [http:\/\/www.nhc.noaa.gov\/archive\/2005\/dis\/al052005.discus.008.shtml? here].
[Hurricanehink]: Cool. Unfortunately, 2004 was a little boring in terms of discussions, IIRC.
[Hurricanehink]: Before I copyedit it, I'll say a few things that need to be done. The intro should be 2 or more paragraphs. Another picture of the hurricane is needed. Were any people evacuated from the hurricane? The impact section is a little disorganized. The easiest way to have a good impact section is to have the first paragraph cover meteorlogical statistics, with the second covering damage. The whole Katrina thing needs a source, and could probably go in preparations. Also, the George Bush declaration should go in aftermath, along with any other possible aftermath. The Carolina picture doesn't make much sense being in Canada, too. I'll copyedit it later when that's done. No sense in starting when more changes are under way. Good job with it, though.
[Hurricanehink]: Yea, the three paragraph preparations section is a little long. Two would be fine. Also, metrication is my word! Get your own :P (j\/k).
[Hurricanehink]: Good to know. Yea, the Ophelia type storm is always fun to do.
[Hurricanehink]: Ouch, that's too bad. I'm encountering this problem with [[Hurricane Charley]]. Rather than making upgrades to an old, rocky road, why not just build a new highway? By this metaphor, I mean just redoing the article.
[Hurricanehink]: It seems like there are a few of us that are working hard on reworking the existing storm and seasonal articles. In essense, we're rebuilding the Wikiproject with a new start; more info, better sourcing, and no mistakes this time. However, it seems like there are a few others that are sort of detrimental to our cause. All they want to do is make new articles for the fact of making new articles. I'm for new articles, but based on their previous work they would likely do a poor job with the article, making us redo it and adding more to the work load. What do you think we should do with those other people? Should we let them be, let them make their articles, and have us fix their errors? Or, should we try and convince them to not make new articles nicely, and have them work on existing articles? I'm trying the latter, but it's not working well. They still have a wishlist for storms that don't need articles, and they are still doing a bad job with grammar and spelling, not to mention sourcing and info.
[Hurricanehink]: Well, I just converted one. Now the question is, do we trust them with the retired hurricane articles? Will they do more harm than good, or will they find a place to work in peace?
[Hurricanehink]: Thanks. True, it doesn't add much to the workload, but it is a bit of a shame that we will spend as much work as they did. The whole ownership thing is very annoying in this case. I've redone Isabel (1985) and Matthew (2004), yet the author's still think they did a lot of work. ::Sigh:: Hopefully we won't have to go back and fix their mistakes for the retired storms. Looking at Iris, this might be the case. The list of thing is another good idea, but look at the [[List of New England hurricanes]]. While it is a good idea, it isn't the best of articles, and would probably require a lot of work from one of us experienced editors to make it good. I just had a very interesting idea. What if we sent them to the Simple English Wikipedia? I know that sounds horrible, but this could solve our problem. They're writing, you have admit, isn't the best, yet it's not very advanced. Provided they learn how to spell (you never know), that would be a great solution!
[Hurricanehink]: [http:\/\/simple.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Main_Page Here's a link] to Simple Wikipedia. Am I horrible for suggesting this?
[Hurricanehink]: Great, too complicated for Simple Wikipedia, too basic for regular Wikipedia. What if we told them that they had to use a spell checker, and they could only use simple words? Someone would have to keep checks on them, making sure they're accurate and spelling correctly, but the \""interferers\"" be able to create articles and write not unlike they have been. Yea, their interest in hurricanes is very valuable, but their lack of typing abilities isn't very useful. Better pictures could work, but pictures are hard to do. Most non .gov sites can't be used, while some .gov can't as well. Fair use is hardest of all, so pictures might be an unwise decision. Maybe another task would work. It would have to be something simple, but probably shouldn't be a popular page. I'll keep thinking. Well, should we at least ask them whether they'd be interested in the Simple Wikipedia?
[Hurricanehink]: Well, we have our first guinea pig. Cyclone 1 is now working on Roxanne. Looking at the writing, it looks perfect for what would be in the Simple English. There's no spelling errors, and the sentences are short and easy to read.
[Hurricanehink]: Alright, I asked him. I think we should also ask Icelandic Hurricane and Hurricanecraze 32. Their writing is probably too simplistic here, yet would be perfect for there. What do you think?
[Hurricanehink]: Also, satellite images is probably the biggest grunt work of all. I doubt anyone would want to search for satellite archives to find a few images. That's just plain mean of you to suggest it ;) One more thing. Seeing as you are a fan of the List of XXX hurricanes, are you going to ever do a [[List of Europe hurricanes]]?
[Hurricanehink]: Ouch!!! Talk about grunt work. I asked another user if he wanted to help out. Europe won't be too long. You could base if off of the [[List of Arizona hurricanes]]. It might be annoying, but it would be neat to see every tropical cyclone that affected Europe. Some of the impacting ones include Debbie (1961- 6 deaths and heavy damage), Charley (heavy damage in U.K.), Arlene (1987, heavy rainfall in Spain), Lili (1996, heavy damage), and Maria (2005, 1 death). It actually could be pretty long. Since 1995, I count 12 that impacted Europe (including Iceland). You could probably also get away with including the Azores and the Canary Islands, seeing as they're British territories.
[Hurricanehink]: Wow, my mind said European territories, but my hands typed British. Sorry about that... LOL. That would be a great article, too, but look at the List of New Jersey hurricanes. Only a few had any significant impact. I think a list of all storms impacting Europe would be a very interesting article, though it could be made down the road.
[Hurricanehink]: Oh sorry. I just reverted it because it messed up the formatting. Can you do it again, but make sure it doesn't mess up anything?
[Hurricanehink]: Oh sorry. I just reverted it because it messed up the formatting. Can you do it again, but make sure it doesn't mess up anything?
[Hurricanehink]: Oh, ok. You can make your changes again, then.
[Hurricanehink]: Oh, ok. You can make your changes again, then.
[Hurricanehink]: Yea, I wrote them, but I am not responsible for the Pagasa names. I just copied and pasted the existing info, but due to laziness and lack of info I stopped at 1990. Good luck with the disambigs.
[Hurricanehink]: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Hurricanehink\/Sandbox This list] I've been working on for a few months might be of some use.
[Hurricanehink]: Yea sure, if you want. I'm not sure how you could expand it more, as it is currently already a page wide, but you could probably shorten the columns to 4 or 3 if needed. My page could potentially be very useful someday, once every name is in there. It would solve all disambiguation problems, and would be the only place where you could find such a list. I have Atlantic, EPAC, CPAC, and WPAC (JTWC names) from ~1948-2005. It didn't go earlier because I couldn't find a source on their names, and due to my suspected ADD which prevents me from working on one task for long periods of time.
[Hurricanehink]: Thanks for that link. I always find those individual links when googling storm info, but was never able to find the master site. The photo archive is great, and I uploaded a better damage pic.
[Hurricanehink]: That is really weak. What else is unfortunate is that storm summaries only go back to 1998. They have pages back to 1953, so you can say President X declared the state a disaster area, but there's no details. Still, it's a great site for modern storms. Very neat about the 1703 storm. I can't imagine tropical characteristics, though Storm05 would, LOL :) That's crazy how damaging it was. Wealth-normalized, is it the costliest British storm?
[Hurricanehink]: Interesting, and too bad it's been forgotten. LOL about Storm05. He must also think that [[2003 Atlantic hurricane season#Tropical Storm Grace|Tropical Storm Grace]] was a Category 5 hurricane at landfall :P
[Hurricanehink]: Should we just get rid of the many N\/A's in it? It might be a pain to add them all in. Also, do you have WPAC naming before 1959?
[Hurricanehink]: Alright, I replaced TD and CPAC with <nowiki>*<\/nowiki>'s and ^'s. Could you add the rest of the WPAC names, as I wasn't sure of before 1951. I'll remove the N\/A's later on. For southern Hemisphere, I think it should be in the calendar year they formed in. Using this format, the Atlantic Alice in 1954 should have 2 1954 Alices, not the 1955 one, right?
[Hurricanehink]: Cool, and good luck. Yea, I was thinking of adding the disambigs and the links to the articles, but that would take '''''a lot''''' of time. In addition, there's the problem that the Atlantic Ocean and the North Indian Ocean area the only areas where every named storm has a section. Most seasons in other basins only have the notable storms. The disambiguations are easy, though I'm not sure if the seasonal linking (like for the 1998 Alex, it would be [[1998 Atlantic hurricane season#Tropical Storm Alex|1998]]) would be worth the trouble.
[Hurricanehink]: It will probably be fairly hard, though mainly just tedious work. Good job on A. Whoops about the alphabetical order, but I'm only human. I made the entire list from scratch back during my college auditions, so I was half-asleep while here on Wikipedia. I'm sure there's a few more errors, like lack of linkage to existing articles and (hopefully not) incorrect years.
[Hurricanehink]: Could you give a look through the Allison article? I just finished giving it a complete makeover (compare to [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Tropical_Storm_Allison&oldid=48500132 this]), and I just wanted an extra pair of eyes. I'm pretty sure I got all of the metric units, so you should be happy about that :P I'm comtemplating putting this up for the next TC FAC after Katrina is done, so the more help the better.
[Hurricanehink]: Really? Do you prefer miles, or something else? Yea, the metrication sucks, but it was worth it if I don't have to do it later. Good with Ophelia, too.
[Hurricanehink]: Oh, cool. Good luck with the changeover. Thanks.
[Hurricanehink]: [ftp:\/\/eclipse.ncdc.noaa.gov\/pub\/isccp\/b1\/.D2790P\/images\/2002\/049\/Img-2002-02-18-12-MET-7-VS.jpg That system isn't that bad]! That link is a visible shot to the same storm. It looks very interesting, though nothing to get too excited about. As you mentioned in the Huroncane debate, Polar lows are apparently warm core, which makes the dividing line between PL's and TC's very blurred. However, this thing is likely extratropical given the time of year. Regardless, great find to an interesting image. Maybe this shouldn't get out. If it did, some users who are crazy about making articles would start a [[2002 Atlantic Polar Low Season]]! :P
[Hurricanehink]: Very nice images, and awesome find with the MODIS version of the Black Sea storm. Yea, the Feb storm was certainly interesting, and that's crazy it came and went in 2 days. LOL, it did look better than Vince, though Vince had the benifit of the doubt of being a tropical cyclone. I think you're giving them too much credit. They'd probably name it Hurricane Arthur thinking that the NHC screwed up not naming it, LOL. I left a comment about the Huroncane on the talk page that could work as a solution. A Hurricane Pam article, while interesting, might be better as a part of Katrina. As seen in [http:\/\/www.fema.gov\/news\/newsrelease.fema?id=13051 this FEMA article], it clearly shows a Katrina like scenario for Louisiana a year before the storm struck. That should definetly go in the preparations section, as there were plans for LA. However, an article would be very interesting...
[Hurricanehink]: LOL, ok fine, they might accept that. Good luck with Pam, and let me know when it's finished.
[Hurricanehink]: You've been doing an awesome job with that. Good luck finding the Fiji names. A question comes to mind. What should it be called when it's time for publishing? It could be [[List of tropical cyclone names]], though it would be confusing with [[Lists of tropical cyclone names]].
[Hurricanehink]: Nice, [[List of named tropical cyclones]] works.
[Hurricanehink]: Well, if you want to DYK, we'll have to copy and paste it, so that's fine. Your suggestion works. (Insert thumbs up) :)
[Hurricanehink]: I just did a few minor edits. The records look correct. Just curious, did you mention all of the retired names listed [http:\/\/www.wmo.ch\/web\/www\/TCP\/OperationPlans\/TCP24-English2004.pdf here]? One storm (Fifi) was missing from the listing. All in all, though, it looks ready to be published. One more thing, could you put the sites you used for some of the naming in the external links? I know someone is going to freak out that there are no inline sources, but there's no need for that. Good luck with the disambiguations. That will truely be the project from hell!
[Hurricanehink]: [http:\/\/www.wmo.ch\/web\/www\/TCP\/OperationPlans\/TCP24-English2004.pdf This site]. It lists all of the retired names in the southern hemisphere. That site will also help with the renaming. Unfortunately, it's as of 2004. --
[Hurricanehink]: Great... Don't you love it when two sources contradict? You'd think that somewhere, someplace would have the Fiji names. Well, that list should still be mentioned. Maybe the Australians were wrong with Fifi? --
[Hurricanehink]: Remember how I said there were places on the WPTC I didn't like to go near? One was modern seasons, and the other was southern hemisphere seasons. This is the exact reason I don't like southern hemisphere seasons; not enough info and too many contradictions. I have no idea what we should do on this. Maybe that page could be mentioned on the newsletter as something that could be expanded? --
[Hurricanehink]: Exactly. Good luck with the disambiguations. It will be hard, probably, but I suppose it's needed and for the best. Like I said about the 2005 season storms, if you scream for help we'll hear it. --
[Hurricanehink]: OK, I guess I might be too bureaucratic for doing that, but our criteria isn't that different. Hmm, maybe I shouldn't be wasting your talk page with this. Should we talk about it more on the discussions page? The criteria was just a few things I wrote down, that you and Icelandic Hurricane agreed to. Should we give the assessment criteria a mention in the newsletter? After all, the newsletter goes to everyone. We could have a response section to have more involvement with some of the members....? --
[Hurricanehink]: The newsletter turned out well. Nice work on another good issue, and thanks for the mention. Preparations aren't that needed, really. The newsletter is for the WPTC, not for people around the world. Sorry about the assessments stuff, but real world crap is wearing me out a bit. I'm working two jobs most days of the week, so sorry if I relieve a little stress on the computer.
[Hurricanehink]: That might be a bad move. The last time I left Wikipedia for a few days, I got even more stressed :) Seriously though, I'll try to keep it cool. Yea, Uncyclopedia is awesome! Thanks for a laugh. --
[Hurricanehink]: As you might know, I plan on doing Typhoon Pongsona as my next redo article. You mentioned that I should use JMA. Do you think that, instead, I could source [http:\/\/australiasevereweather.com\/cyclones\/2003\/summ0212.txt Gary Padgett's December Tropical Summary] for the storm history, which includes JTWC and JMA data? Simply using the JMA best track would be a little annoying, but by referencing that site, it would offer both centers. Then, the centers' respective best tracks could be linked in the other links section. Does that sound alright? Hypothetically if Pongsona was FAC'd, would that be a big issue? Thanks in advance. --
[Hurricanehink]: Thanks for the input, and I completely forgot the possibility of Padgett using operational data. A major problem I can forsee will be the usage of maximum sustained winds. Should it be in 1 min. sustained or 10 min. sustained? JMA uses 10, which means it should be used. However, writing 105 mph (10 min. sustained, 145 mph 1 min. sustained, 190 km\/h 10 min. sustained, 250 km\/h 1 min. sustained) for example would be a big pain. I suppose it could be \""Pongsona reached peak winds of 105 mph (10 min. sustained, 190 km\/h 10 min. sustained), or 145 mph 1 min. sustained (250 km\/h 1 min. sustained)\"". I think I'll explain the differences in the beginning, but every wind measurement will be long and tedious. A JMA track map would be nice (to get the official feel), but it only indicates a peak of 105 mph, as opposed to 145 mph from JTWC. I don't know. I hate when things are this complicated ;) --
[Hurricanehink]: OK, I suppose using 10 min. throughout works. What about km\/h? Should that be in 10 min. as well? Glad you found the conversion factor, and given that 10 min. will be used throughout, the track map should be too. --
[Hurricanehink]: Good idea. I had never thought of it, but yea, using discussions and such can make subtle, yet important changes to low-importance articles. Given that I'm already here, could you possibly do me a favor? Could you possibly make a track map for all tropical cyclones affecting South America? I'll get you the list and the numbers, but I was wondering if that wouldn't be too big of a deal. --
[Hurricanehink]: Whoops, I actually meant having one map for all of the South American tropical cyclones. Is that doable? --
[Hurricanehink]: Cool. I'll get you the list later. I'm still working on the article to see which ones affected the continent. --
[Hurricanehink]: That's all of them. Thanks in advance, this will look really nice. In case you're interested, they're for a [[List of South America tropical cyclones]] article I am working on, though you probably figured that.
[Hurricanehink]: Good point, Catarina is just weird and not that needed. Plus, it would expand the map too much. As for Beta, it struck the Colombian island of Providencia, that's why I added it. Yes, it's closer to Nicaragua, but it's an island of a country from South America. That's why I included it. --
[Hurricanehink]: OK, I emailed you back.
[Hurricanehink]: Thanks! That looks exactly like I imagined. :)
[Hurricanehink]: Also, if possible, could you give a quick look at the article, just to make sure there aren't any big mistakes? Thanks for all your help.
[Hurricanehink]: Cool. Grr... I knew I was missing something! However, I know for a fact (as well as you probably know) that I am a sloppy writer at times, and I overlook the stupidest things I write.
[Hurricanehink]: Could you possibly add Hattie (1961) to the list? I missed that when I made the list. Thanks. --
[Hurricanehink]: LOL, sorry, and I hope so. --
[Hurricanehink]: I fixed that. I'm fairly sure the rest are good, too. If at all possible, could there be two pics in the one larger pic? One could be a zoomed out pic with all of the storms, including those that didn't come near the state, and the other would be a zoomed in pic of Delaware with all storms that crossed the state. Hopefully that works out, and thanks again. Also, I support either version of the worldwide pic. They're both so good, that I can't decide! :)
[Hurricanehink]: Thanks! However, you're right, it isn't as useful as I had hoped, but oh well. It works.
[Hurricanehink]: If it's not too much of a trouble for you, do you want to see what that would look like? I'll put the list on your request page.
[Hurricanehink]: The new one looks good. Thanks. Also, the article quality is good as of August 2, so that should be representative for the month of July. I might have missed or added something (knowing me, that's probable ;)) but I think it's good. --
[Hurricanehink]: Also, shouldn't the newsletter be for July, not June? There are a few references to June (DYK). --
[Hurricanehink]: Nice, thanks for sending that my way. Also, why is this; \""Tropical Storm Lee was probably national news at the time, depending on where it went and what it did. Millions of people knew about it.\"" in the header for the Newsletter? Also, thanks for the MOTM write up thing. I didn't even know I was nominated! --
[Hurricanehink]: Nice! LOL. --
[Hurricanehink]: Ugh, do I have to?? ;) Just kidding. I'll try and remember to go there. If at all possible could you post talk page messages on my talk page here? This way I will at least remember. Hopefully that's not too much trouble. Also, I don't really see the need to delete the image. Yes, it was superseded, but there's no harm in having two different images of the same storm, IMO.
[Hurricanehink]: Yea, yea... Ok.
[Hurricanehink]: Yea, I try and do that, but sometimes I forget. Sorry... I don't even remember uploading that Ernesto image, come to think of it. OK, I'll try and do that in the future.
[Hurricanehink]: I'll try and follow the new organization of things when I upload images in the future, but I'll wait until most of the categorization is done. Though the average person might not notice any difference, the changes will truely be great, and we appreciate it.
[Hurricanehink]: Cool. BTW, now that we're on the subject of the rainfall pics, I personally believe some of them aren't needed in articles, like Chantal (2001). What do you think?
[Hurricanehink]: If you are serious about making such an article, it is going to require a lot of work and research. There are many websites out there that could help for such an article, but it will take time to sift through the data. There are around 15 storms since 2000 to affect the state. That's 15 in only 5 years, and you have to cover back as early as it goes. If you are not willing to do such a project, post a message on the Wikiproject either asking for help or asking for a merge\/delete. Good luck!
[Hurricanehink]: Sorry to but in, but I don't want Charley FA'd yet (thanks for the kind words). I don't think is ready, and I believe that Florida and Aftermath need to be finished first. And for the record, Charley has gone down a few notches on my caring list.
[Hurricanehink]: You shouldn't call the storms Storm #15. It can be a little confusing, especially if it changes later due to re-analysis. You should just say, A tropical storm moved through the state, not Storm #15 moved through the state.
[Hurricanehink]: Yea. What about including storms before 1851? There are storms before 1851 that affected Pennsylvania, yet don't have numbers. It will be a little weird to go from, \""In 1751 a tropical storm was last observed in Pennsylvania\"" to \""In 1872 Storm #2 produced heavy rainfall over the state\"" (examples). Having Storm #2 makes no sense in this context. This is a list of tropical cyclones to affect Pennsylvania, not which storms from which seasons affected the state. I hope you understand the difference.
[Hurricanehink]: These comments remain the same, sorry. If you are truly serious about such a project, it is going to take a lot of time to do it. You will have to go through all of the monthly weather reviews, storm archives, and raw data reports from Hurdat to ensure accuracy. Otherwise, it is a stub article that isn't particularly useful, and could potentially be deleted.
[Hurricanehink]: Pretty good, but I'd like to see sources for the first paragraph of intellectular structures, the second paragraph of Extracellular structures, first paragraph of Metabolism, and the second paragraph of Growth and reproduction.
[Hurricanehink]: Cool, I'm convinced.
[Hurricanehink]: I'm not sure if you have that or not. I just thought I'd check.
[Hurricanehink]: Sorry, I just found it off [http:\/\/www.storm2k.org\/phpbb2\/viewtopic.php?t=92012 another weather message board]. However, the topic creator in that link says the wind units are in knots. Does that clear anything? It was completely silly of you to mention Isabel there. I nearly died laughing :P (just kidding) Yea, a reflectivity image at or near landfall would be ideal, if possible.
[Hurricanehink]: Damn, that's a disappointment :(
[Hurricanehink]: I understand. I'll admit, I'm a little anal about sourcing, but I believe that everything needs to be sourced. If the references are at the beginning of the section, those refs can just be used again. If looking cluttered is a fear, then all of the sources for the paragraph could be placed at the end of the paragraph.
[Hurricanehink]: Here's some things off the top of my head. Some citations are needed. Like the other article, I think there are a few too many sentences in parenthesis. There are four times when the article says to see elsewhere, which doesn't seem like compelling prose. I just noticed, \""To meet this challenge\"" in the lede, and I think it should be reworded (it's a bit trite. I would rewrite some of the image captions, as some are a bit too long. Are there any differences in the immune system of the human or any other animal? It says in the lede that multiple organisms have evolved to recognize and neutralize pathogens, but is it all, or have some notable ones not evolved it?
[Hurricanehink]: Can you make that sometime while the article is still on FLC, or should I ask someone else?
[Hurricanehink]: Thanks.
[Hurricanehink]: Thank you very much, and I'll keep to my end of the deal by assuring Ignacio gets to GA ;) I think all of the tracks are good. Some had far reaching effects, like rough surf or its outer bands producing rainfall in the state.
[Hurricanehink]: Rather than starting a revert war, I'll talk here. My issue with Marty is primarily continuity between other WPTC articles. Continually removing the hat for that one article could be seen as disruptive, given that you haven't done the same to any others. And I'd hardly call [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Tropical_cyclones\/Archive_12#Distinguishing_things_that_don.27t_need_it this] a discussion on whether or not to include a hatnote on the top of each page.
[Hurricanehink]: Now we're getting somewhere, rather than speaking our thoughts in the tiny edit summaries :) I'll admit, I forgot about that discussion - it was three months ago, after all, and nothing seemed to happen with it. You made some fair points, and I believe [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Hurricane_Marty_%282003%29&diff=167004033&oldid=166999947 this] would be a great compromise. It eliminates the hatnote, and it gives something to the See also section, which really should not be List of notable cyclones.
[Hurricanehink]: Regarding Peter, yea, that was me being really stupid, as usual. I fixed it. Regarding Marty, is that an adequate solution? I believe that the other storm pages should be linked somewhere. If we both agree, then Marty can be de-protected. --
[Hurricanehink]: Heh, I didn't know you were still dealing with that user. I know my solution is not ideal, but removing the hatnotes and deleting the pages is a bit of a two-part process. Some might object to deleting those hatnotes right now given their place, but if they were in the See also section of the article, they wouldn't be as valuable. If those pages don't get deleted any time soon (after all, the discussion pages on storm archives were kept), then these could have a bit of a purpose. There is some value in having them to link to other related articles - off the top of my head, I can think of Barry, Dean, Alberto, Beryl, and Debby in just the past two years. --
[Hurricanehink]: Wait, I'm confused - since when did I ever care about policy. ;) But I'm also confused by your response. What is the harm in putting the dab page in the see also, like [[Hurricane Barry]] for all Barry articles.
[Hurricanehink]: Who says that the \""sole purpose\"" of dab pages is to \""help readers find the correct article\""? You've said yourself that our dabs are more than typical dabs. Why can't we [[WP:IAR|ignore]] their sole purpose and use them as articles in the see also section? The navbars might take time, and God knows they're much more work than to put a link in one section (and for that matter also removing it from the top). To avoid the potential naming confusing, a Barry article could have [[Hurricane Barry|Other tropical cyclones named Barry]] as the wikilink; what is the harm in doing that?
[Hurricanehink]: You passed my challenge, with [[Hurricane Danny (1997)]] passing its FAC. Take your pick :) --
[Hurricanehink]: Good choice, and thanks for participating. --
[Hurricanehink]: Hey there. I don't think I ever welcomed you, so welcome to the Tropical cyclone WikiProject! I'm just curious, where do you see yourself contributing to the project? We've seen a lot of users leave, so anywhere would be appreciated. I see you have experience in many other articles, which is great. Well, I hope to see you around. Cheers. --
[Hurricanehink]: Hey, I'm glad to see you're still interested in the project. Are you still interested in contributing as well? The project hasn't seen much activity lately, and any work to any article would be appreciated. --
[Hurricanehink]: That's great. Do you think you could give any of the articles on [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Tropical cyclones\/Noticeboard|FAC or FLC]] some copyediting, when you have a chance? --
[Hurricanehink]: Awesome. I'll keep you in mind for future copyediting. Peace. --
[Hurricanehink]: That's cool. Do you think, if you had time, that you'd be able to give any of the hurricane articles on FAC or FLC a look at ([[Wikipedia:WikiProject Tropical cyclones\/Noticeboard|here]]? --
[Hurricanehink]: Hello there. I notice you recently added your name to the '''Inactive participants''' in the Tropical cyclone Wikiproject. However, that section is for people who were previously part of the project, but haven't been active in several months. Did you accidentally put your name in the inactive participants, by chance? The project is always in need of editors, so it would be great if we had you around! \u266c\u2669
[Hurricanehink]: It's great to have you aboard, and I look forward to seeing you around! \u266c\u2669
[Hurricanehink]: The [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Tropical cyclones\/Newsletter\/Archive 18|June issue]] of the [[WP:WPTC|WikiProject Tropical cyclones]] newsletter is now available. If you wish to receive the full newsletter or no longer be informed of the release of future editions, please add your username to the appropriate section on the [[WP:WPTC\/SPAM|mailing list]]. \u266c\u2669
[Hurricanehink]: I reverted your edit to the Tropical Storm Edouard article, which claimed the damage total was about $25 million. However, you did not provide a source, so I reverted it. I would be happy to undo my edit, but only if you can provide the source for the $25 million damage estimate. \u266c\u2669
[Hurricanehink]: Alright. I removed that piece of information from the season impact table. \u266c\u2669
[Hurricanehink]: Now I have some news for you. We're experimenting with the FA successor to Irene 05 - [[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates\/Tropical Storm Erick (2007)|FAC for Tropical Storm Erick in 2007]]. Remember how you wanted to write an article for Andres 03, or something like that? Juliancolton beat you to the punch, and is now doing the ultimate test. \u266c\u2669
[Hurricanehink]: About the NIO best track, is it cite-able? If not, then I don't want to torment myself by not being able to use it. If so, then hell yea! \u266c\u2669
[Hurricanehink]: I never asked if it was reliable - I just asked if it was cite-able. Seeing that it is - hell yea! \u266c\u2669
[Hurricanehink]: Hey there! I was bored and was checking some fellow user contributions, and I noticed you were planning on working on the aforementioned list. Do you need a hand with it? I was just thinking yesterday (with the prospect of Omeka forming) that the article should exist. --\u266b
[Hurricanehink]: Yea, I was involved in that FL, so that was why I was thinking about an EPAC one. I'll add the list of storms, since I know them off the top of my head, and do you want to do the formatting? --\u266b
[Hurricanehink]: Alright, I added the nine within the best track (which is what I think it should be limited to). I realized (after finishing it) that only one storm caused any deaths\/damage (Nina), and only one other affected land (Winnie). Therefore, it shouldn't be exactly based on the Atlantic one, since the Atlantic one includes both deaths and damage. --\u266b
[Hurricanehink]: So quick question, and I hope it's not too big to ask. The page on [http:\/\/www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov\/tropical\/rain\/tcsoutheast.html TC rainfall in the Southeast] says Able 52 peaked at 6.11 inches in North Carolina, but the [http:\/\/www.aoml.noaa.gov\/general\/lib\/lib1\/nhclib\/mwreviews\/1952.pdf MWR] says the NC peak was 6.33 inches. I'm wondering what the discrepancy is. --\u266b
[Hurricanehink]: Thanks for the quick explanation. The Fort Bragg reading is a lot higher than all others listed in MWR, so it would make sense if it was adjusted for quality control. I'm sure when re-analysis comes around, they'll address it, but until then I wouldn't want anyone to go to such lengths as having to look through a card catalog to find a relatively minor rainfall total. --\u266b
[Hurricanehink]: I have another rainfall question. The [http:\/\/www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov\/tropical\/rain\/tcstatemaxima.gif state maxima map] says Nevada's rainiest storm was Olivia 82 with 3.52 inches, but [http:\/\/www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov\/tropical\/rain\/tcwest.html Doreen 72] caused 4.14 inches in Nevada. I'm wondering what the discrepancy is, as I figured that'd be a good article to make for DYK purposes. Thanks! --\u266b
[Hurricanehink]: Ah, thanks! --\u266b
[Hurricanehink]: Just to let you know, I have put your GA nomination - [[Talk:Braer Storm of January 1993\/GA1|Braer Storm of January 1993 on hold]]. You have seven days to address the comments. Cheers! --\u266b
[Hurricanehink]: No problem. I was happy to do them instead of the usual storm articles ;) --\u266b
[Hurricanehink]: I'm happy to pass the Braer storm. Just one minor thing (didn't feel like holding up the GAN over it), but I still have no idea whether the storm caused snowfall or not. That's the only thing. Otherwise, thanks for addressing my comments! --\u266b
[Hurricanehink]: Hah, thanks a lot for reviewing! My philosophy is that I try and review as many GAN's as I put up, so I have one more to do. --\u266b
[Hurricanehink]: Yay, thanks a lot! I was wondering if there was any chance you could do me a favor. Is there any rainfall for [[Hurricane Carol (1953)]]? --\u266b
[Hurricanehink]: Uhoh, good luck with that. No hurry with Carol. ;) --\u266b
[Hurricanehink]: I seriously had no idea that even existed! You're darn right it's an interesting article. I love the coverage on older stuff like that that no longer exist. --\u266b
[Hurricanehink]: Hey, good call about the timeline, I always forget about those! As for the naming, I knew about them, but they didn't seem to be very official\/consistent. I think the current wording in the article is fine, how it was \""the first year in which tropical cyclones were given official names in the Atlantic basin\"". I know [[User:Jason Rees]] has been pursuing that topic recently, and I think he has another example or two of pre-1950 AHS naming. --\u266b
[Hurricanehink]: Hey, I put the GA nomination of Lidia on hold, just so you know. --\u266b
[Hurricanehink]: Whoa, no problem! It's a low priority, compared to your brew-ha. If only editing Wikipedia was a way to get out of jury duty... \u266b
[Hurricanehink]: Hah, I think that sounds like a [[WP:Wikipediaholic|Wikipediaholic]] ;) \u266b
[Hurricanehink]: Hey, I just wanted to let you know I had a copyeditor thoroughly look over the article. I hope it's better now! \u266b
[Hurricanehink]: By the way, I was just curious, is there any chance of [[Hurricane King]] getting a rainfall map? I'm just curious, since Easy has one, and I figured\/hoped the data would be there. I might be interested long-term in getting it to FA, so 1950 AHS is an FT. --\u266b
[Hurricanehink]: Whoa, I didn't know the naming potentially went back to 1946. That's cool the rain will be going back that far when you get a chance. It's crazy you will almost have the entire recon era covered. --\u266b
[Hurricanehink]: Hey, I addressed the last of your comments. --\u266b
[Hurricanehink]: I went ahead and fixed the copy and paste move. Miss Madeline is right. If another user edits your sandbox, then you can't copy and paste it, as it destroys the edit history. --\u266b
[Hurricanehink]: The Lester 92 one is as well. I thought you would've seen it on your watchlist. --\u266b
[Hurricanehink]: The seven days for Lester are up. Have you worked on it at all? \u266b
[Hurricanehink]: Wow, that would be amazing! The current pics are rather lackluster, and none showed any significant intensity or an unusually large eye. In fact, I was really surprised the NHC didn't have anything [http:\/\/www.nhc.noaa.gov\/archive\/storm_wallets\/cdmp\/ in their electronic wallet] on storms in 1971. They have every other year from 1968 to 1983. Do you have any idea why? \u266b
[Hurricanehink]: That looks great. Do you, by chance, have anything else from 1971? That's next on my seasonal list (as opposed to continuing with the 50's spree). --\u266b
[Hurricanehink]: Awesome, that's great news! --\u266b
[Hurricanehink]: Hey, so I'm not sure if anyone's told you before, but there is a sort of chatroom for the WPTC on [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]]. There are a bunch of us on there (myself, Jason Rees, Cyclonebiskit, Juliancolton, Titoxd, Yellow Evan, among others), and we often talk about hurricanes and stuff. We pose ideas, help each other out while writing articles, IDK how to describe it. We delve into off-topic stuff, for sure, but it's a fun place to get to know other people in the project, so we're more than just a name. You can get there by going [http:\/\/webchat.freenode.net\/ here], typing in your nickname, putting '''#wiki-hurricanes''' as the channel, and connecting. I hope to see you on there, since you are a rather productive editor, and IMO an important member of the project. --\u266b
[Hurricanehink]: Hey, have you considered this yet? A bunch of us are on there now. --\u266b
[Hurricanehink]: And BTW, I have a topic that's nearly ready for GTC, but it's just missing one. [[Tropical Depression One (1988)]], which you wrote, is the only one preventing [[List of off-season Atlantic hurricanes]] from being a GT. I was wondering if you had any intentions on finishing that? It would save me a ton of hassle! --\u266b
[Hurricanehink]: Hah, no problem. Yea, I was just curious if you were planning to finish that article. And I can merge Edouardo no problem! So, I take it you're not interested in the IRC, then? --\u266b
[Hurricanehink]: There isn't really a standard, unfortunately. Once you go back a certain point (which varies by decade), there is no real consistency. In the western Pacific, there isn't even any data on most storms in the 1920s, so a storm in that decade would be better as a standalone article. In the Atlantic post-1868 or East Pacific post-1967, chances are the storm already has a section. If there isn't much info to be added, it should just be in the section summary. Conversely, if it's in any other basin, it comes down to how the season article is and how notable the storm is. --\u266b
[Hurricanehink]: Yea, older storms are hard for that region. I find our broader coverage is greatly lacking, such as the deadliest page, or [[List of costliest Atlantic hurricanes]]. It'd be so much more helpful getting one of those pages in line, as opposed to a storm article no one has ever heard of. --\u266b
[Hurricanehink]: Aww, you can't plan for articles. You just gotta jump in headfirst. It's like working out. You can't think about doing it and then start; you gotta do it when you're most PUMPED! --\u266b
[Hurricanehink]: Hey, I believe I addressed your concerns for Gert. --\u266b
[Hurricanehink]: Hey, I replied and addressed your comments for Nora 03. Thanks a lot for the great review! I haven't had a GA review that thorough in a long time. \u266b
[Hurricanehink]: No problem! I think it's fairly close to going for GA, but it's just missing some more info. \u266b
[Hurricanehink]: Alright, I replied to Linda's review. It's nice having someone so thorough in their reviews! --\u266b
[Hurricanehink]: I got that last spelling error. I still feel strongly about the current wording of the first sentence. I just hope that doesn't affect the GA review. --\u266b
[Hurricanehink]: BTW, I see you're considering an article for Fran. As much as I'd love one for Fran and Beryl 82, there really isn't the impact info to justify either, IMHO (or at least, a good variety of sources). --\u266b
[Hurricanehink]: Hey, I noticed you've been editing that article recently. I just thought you should know there is a merge proposal to combine the formats. \u266b
[Hurricanehink]: Also, I addressed your comments on 1991 AHS's GAN. Thanks a lot for reviewing it. \u266b
[Hurricanehink]: Greetings from the other hemisphere! I just thought I'd let you know that us hurricane folks are trying to get more organized. We've created task forces for both the Atlantic and the Eastern Pacific. Would you have any interest in starting\/joining one for the Australian basin? I figured, there should be a singular area for discussion on Australian cyclones. It would definitely help for situations like (Severe Tropical) Cyclone Yasi (and I'm still sorry that the discussion as heated as it did... we should be writing articles, not editorials!). It might help if Australian cyclone editors don't want to join the WPTC as a whole in case they felt their interests weren't being represented. What do you think? \u266b
[Hurricanehink]: Fortunately it's your off-season, so you'd be able to get stuff up and running before the season starts. --\u266b
[Hurricanehink]: You could get a GT too if you just GA nom Josephine! ([http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Featured_topic_candidates\/1987_Atlantic_hurricane_season\/archive1&curid=32469193&diff=440534088&oldid=440533864 and this problem wouldn't happen for you] :P ) --\u266b
[Hurricanehink]: Hey, I know that was a bit of a project of yours. I thought I should let you know it's on AFD. To be honest, I don't think it should exist, since Wikipedia isn't meant to be a directory of loosely associated storms. --\u266b
[Hurricanehink]: Hey, I was wondering what [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion\/Global_storm_activity_of_late_2010_%282nd_nomination%29&diff=prev&oldid=440768222 this] is about? You are an admin, aren't you? --\u266b
[Hurricanehink]: Hey, I know I've told you before, but it'd be great if you could join us once in a while on IRC. It's usually me, Juliancolton, Cyclonebiskit, Titoxd, Yellow Evan, Auree, and a few other editors. --\u266b
[Hurricanehink]: Oh sweet! First, you can [http:\/\/webchat.freenode.net\/ go here]. Type your name under ''Nickname'', #wiki-hurricanes under ''Channels'', and then do the reCAPTCHA and click connect. --\u266b
[Hurricanehink]: The key thing is having ''#wiki-hurricanes'' under Channels (note the hash tag). You add your nickname, do the recaptcha, and click connect. Once you're in, the channel will automatically come up. --\u266b
[Hurricanehink]: Hmm, try another nickname. Something like \""Test\"". --\u266b

[Hurricanehink]: [http:\/\/www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov\/tropical\/rain\/tcstatemaxima.gif] - hey, I was wondering about this. You have the 1954 unnamed depression causing over 9 inches of rain, but that isn't listed as the peak storm for New Mexico. I just thought I'd let you know while I'm (hopefully) redoing the 1954 AHS page. \u266b
[Hurricanehink]: I did. It says it's from 1950 to 2010, which is why I thought it'd include the 1954 depression ;) --\u266b

Nev1,False,"[Nev1]: Hi, I was wondering if you could take a look at the Buckton Castle article and tell me what you think. I'd like it to be GA standard, it's a short article but there's only so much that can said about it and I think this is nearly it. I'm coming to you because you  got the [[Halton Castle]] article to GA. I know these are two  very different articles (Buckton never - as far as we know - had anything like royal visits and wasn't in use during the civil war) but Halton Castle is the only castle GA I've come across. Thanks.
[Nev1]: Thanks for the help, I've not be able to completely address all the points you raised - for example, a current state section would be woefully small as there really isn't much to say - but what you suggested has improved the article, especially the recommendation about the plan by Ormerod. I'll put it up at [[WP:GAC]] and just see what happens. I'm not sure which the other two ringworks are, but I think [[Chester Castle]] may be one of them (another article ripe for expansion).
[Nev1]: The problem is I reverted the vandalism just before you did. No need to worry about vandals getting better, just other editors getting under your feet :-P
[Nev1]: I've asked Jza84 if he could have a go at drawing a new plan, he's asking if we have any source material he could work from. The only one I can think of is the plan currently in the article, do you have any others?
[Nev1]: Would it be possible to use Sambot to update articles like [[List of Australian ODI cricketers]]? One of the problems with some of WP:CRIC's FLs is that the statistics are out of date.
[Nev1]: I've attempted a rewrite of the paragraph with 4(!) citation. Cold you [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Scout_Moor_Wind_Farm&curid=20034019&diff=259555864&oldid=259554513 take a look] and see if any meaning is lost? I think a litte repetition is removed, and if you're happy with it, I can tell Matisse his issue has been addressed.
[Nev1]: I've left some comments on the list of Grade I LBs in Runcorn and I think that with everyone's comments, you could probably skip peer review. Scheduled Monuments on the other hand are much more difficult to get information about. Pastscape is generally reliable, and does tell you if a site's scheduled, either under the main description or listed as a \""Scheduled Monument Notification\"" under the sources. The problem is (as far as I know) you can't search for just Scheduled Monuments. Some local authorities might provide lists of SMs on their websites, but it's hit and miss; I just checked and I couldn't find one for Halton. Ages ago, I started a list of the [[Scheduled Monuments in Greater Manchester|SMs in Greater Manchester]] with an eye to taking it to FLC, but it's not finished because I couldn't be sure which ones were missing. It's just occurred to me that for a complete list it would probably be worth e-mailing Cheshire's county archaeologist [http:\/\/www.archaeology.co.uk\/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=500&Itemid=39]. Hapy editing,
[Nev1]: Cheshire's got a good collection of GAs going on, 20 compares favourably to [[WP:YORKS]] 25. I'm impressed with the way the FLC's going, much smoother than Grade I LBs in GM went, and I tentatively think it will get promoted. I never agree with all the points these raise, but sometimes it is easier just to make the changes. And of course, good suggestions do get made, I like the map of all points, is it as simple as adding <nowiki>{{GeoGroupTemplate}}<\/nowiki>?
[Nev1]: Because I recognised SRX, I hadn't clicked on their name to see who they were. It's lucky you pointed that out, because I was rather annoyed with someone opposing on what seemed to be just the use of commas! I've implemented all of the comma changes suggested, although they don't all feel right; if you think they're wrong, feel free to change them back. I'll be a bit pushed for time today, but I'll help out where I can.
[Nev1]: I completely agree with what Malleus said, the article certainly has my [unspoken] support, that's why I got involved. It feels like some comments are based on [[WP:ILIKEIT]], but hopefully the closer will understand.
[Nev1]: I doubt the article would be deleted, consensus seems to be leading that way and it's clearly notable.
[Nev1]: I just noticed you're making the list in your sandbox, and I like the way it's done, although you'll need a key to explain that SM no. and HER no. mean scheduled monument and historic environment number respectively. I would query whether it's important to mention them as they don't tell you specifically about the monument, and since those details are (I'm assuming) in the database you have access to rather than Pastscape, it might not fly at FLC. The remains section, though, is something I will ''definitely'' be <s>stealing<\/s> using for GM, and since there are so many SAMs for GM that don't have articles, I'll probably use a description column too.
[Nev1]: Period would be an interesting way of dividing the list, but would by district be more practical?
[Nev1]: Ah, I hadn't thought about Warrington and Halton. It wouldn't make sens to have lists with one or two items, but when dividing by location only current administrative boundaries (or rather the April ones) makes sense, so probably best to dismiss that idea. On reflection, period seems like the best bet, although why 1006? It seems like an arbitrary date rather than one recognised as important in British history. Did you mean 1066? Also, there'd be scope for further division if necessary, such as prehistory, Roman to medival, and post-medieval to modern.
[Nev1]: Forgot to say, go for it with Egerton-Warburton. It's hardly trial by fire for an article so well referenced and written, and should easily pass IMO.
[Nev1]: I've recently been expanding the [[Scheduled Monuments in Greater Manchester\u200e]] article (it looks like I completed it a while ago without realising it), and was wondering what you thought of it. I'm happy with the way it's going, the description section compensates for most of the monuments lacking articles, bringing the key facts about the subject into one place. The images aren't ideal, many are poor quality and I'd like more, but those used are pretty much what's available. The map doesn't seem to work with OS coordinates, do you think it would be worth converting them into the format (that works) in [[listed buildings in Runcorn, Cheshire]]? (I think I probably know the answer, but I'm looking for an excuse not to spend an hour or so playing with numbers.) As far as the lead is concerned, I'm not sure how best to proceed and any suggestions would be welcome. The first two paragraphs seem like a good start to me, but more is probably needed.
[Nev1]: 39 makes life easier when writing the list, but is a bit disappointing. There's enough information for pretty much every entry in the GM list to be fleshed out and prevent it looking unbalanced, but doing the same for 200+ monuments will me a mammoth task. Since I started the descriptions from scratch, it was easy to write in full sentences, and although the criteria is \""professional prose\"", my impression is they're much less fussy about the quality at FLC than they are at FAC. How are you thinking about splitting the post-1066 list? Would medieval and post-medieval produce balanced lists?
[Nev1]: I just thought I'd let you know that I've [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Template_talk:Did_you_know&diff=prev&oldid=274554262 suggested an alternative hook] for the article, and think that with so many pictures available, we probably should go for the top spot of the DYK section.
[Nev1]: Malleus leaving would be a waste, and I hope that after time away from wikipedia he will choose to return. If the numbers are still a problem for Awadewit, we could go with a more ambiguous hook, just mentioning the type of monuments (similar to the suggestion I crossed out because I thought Espresso Addict's suggestion was better!)
[Nev1]: Is this a retirement from wikipedia? It's been a bad week for editors from the north west.
[Nev1]: I'd noticed Ddstrtch's notice of resignation, and I don't think Malleus is coming back. WP:UKGEO can't afford this, never mind WP:CHES! This is a setback for the Cheshire Project, and I think Cheshire will find it more difficult to absorb the loss. Losing three (let's hope they don't all go) prolific editors is dispiriting, but I'll be hanging around as my approach to wikipedia is slightly selfish: I spend a lot of time on subjects I'm interested in, and expanding articles is a way for me to learn more about them, and it's a far more effective way of making information stick than just reading it.
[Nev1]: In my experience article writing &ndash; even at FAC &ndash; is much less stressful than getting involved in places like RfA. DDstretch and Espresso Addict are\/were much more active admins than myself; I generally just act when I see a problem rather than going looking for trouble. There's a perception that wikipedia is failing, I'm not sure I agree with this (there's more quality content than ever, but people are concerned with who is at the top, making decisions on who can and can't edit etc), but Malleus thought that, and got involved to try to improve this place. It's not right to disenfranchise oneself, and I'd like to see wikipedia improve, but you can't fight every battle.
[Nev1]: I've just made [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Scheduled_Monuments_in_Cheshire_(1066%E2%80%931539)&diff=276361002&oldid=274915361 this edit], trimming about 5kb of info from the refs in [[Scheduled Monuments in Cheshire (1066\u20131539)\u200e]]. The search parameters at the end of the url mean that the links don't work, so when using an address in references it's best to get rid of that bit (the webpage usually tells you somewhere the address without all the rubbish at the end).
[Nev1]: It didn't take that long, but pastscape is down at the moment so I can double check that the links still work (doubly annoying because I was about to have a go at writing about some castles). It wasn't a big task really, it only took a few minutes. Thank goodness they chose the article, I thought the boat had been missed. Maybe not the first choice of hook, but at this stage any publicity is good publicity.
[Nev1]: As promised, the article has gone live. What I've tried to do is give a brief run down of who, what, when, and why for each castle although for some very little info is available. As such, the entries vary in size. I think with a bit of polish it's ready to go to FLC (and I'll send it to DYK later today). I'd like your opinion on the article as a whole if you have time, particularly the map I made and that's being used as a lead image. It doesn't look as good as the Greater Manchester one did, probably because there are more castles and they're closer together. It ends up looking a little bit messy, and I'm wondering whether it would be worth redoing it, or maybe have one of the other images in the article as a lead image? Also, are there any unanswered questions from the lead (ie: do you feel like the reader needs more explanation of what castles were\/why they were built)? Cheers,
[Nev1]: I had noticed the churches in your sandbox and wondered what the plan was with such a large list. I knew Douglas was prolific, but I had no idea he'd been involved in so many places! It seems inevitable that when writing articles about Cheshire that you'll stumble across Douglas. I assume you'll be removing the list of works from his biography once the stuff in your sandbox goes into the mainspace?
[Nev1]: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Template_talk%3ADid_you_know&diff=283687015&oldid=283686633 Here's the hook], not bad I think, but if you come up with one you think is better don't hesitate to add it as an alternative!
[Nev1]: Hi, I was looking through [[WP:GAN#Places]] and noticed that the Gaza article has been on hold for over five weeks. There doesn't seem to have been much discussion on the talk page in April, so what's the status of the article?
[Nev1]: In response to the question you asked [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AWikiProject_Historic_sites&diff=282791028&oldid=282601620 here], I don't think there is an easy way of searching for them. If there is, I wasted a lot of time while writing [[list of Scheduled Monuments in Greater Manchester]]. I think [[User:Peter I. Vardy]] encountered similar problems when writing [[Scheduled Monuments in Cheshire (pre-1066)]], [[Scheduled Monuments in Cheshire (post-1539)]], and [[Scheduled Monuments in Cheshire (1066\u20131539)]], three gargantuan lists. If you have questions, I'd recommend asking him as I'll be editing infrequently for a while. I know and contacted the local council for help. What I did for the Greater Manchester list was to look at the list maintained by each local authority (although not all of them are available online), and used pastscape as a backup. Pastscape is run by [[English Heritage]] (who decide what is a SM and what isn't) and has 400,000 entries because it doesn't just include SMs but other historic sites and find spots (more information [http:\/\/www.pastscape.org.uk\/FAQ.aspx here]). If you're seeking information on Scheduled Monuments, I'd suggest asking your local archaeology unit, which will probably be attached to a university. I must admit, I am quite envious of the Scottish system which has them all listed. Happy editing,
[Nev1]: I'm just letting you know that I'm about to start reading through the article (first inmpressions are very good), and sorry it's been a few days since you asked. You might also like to know that I've expanded the [[Chichester Castle]] article and have nominated for DYK (... did you know that Chichester Castle was built in the Rape of Chichester in the 11th century).
[Nev1]: When you nominate Farleigh Hungerford Castle for DYK (which I assume you will be as it fits the criteria), I suggest you use one of the images as they look good and you'll probably get the top spot. Castles articles usually get a few thousand visits when they're on the mainpage.
[Nev1]: I think the one of the gateway in the infobox is probably a good bet. The image of the ruined tower is too tall (although it could be cropped), so wouldn't look good at 100x100 px, and the same goes for the painting; I don't think the chapel is as eyecatching as the gateway and might seem a bit odd unless the chapel is mentioned in the hook. Flickr has a few images under a commons licence, and although I don't think they should replace the ones in the article it might be worth creating a category on commons and uploading them there.
[Nev1]: I've added a link to the commons category in the article. The DYK hook is the same one I would have chosen. You forgot to add you name to the nomination, but I've fixed it.
[Nev1]: Not a silly question at all, they're in the local university library.
[Nev1]: Your hard work has secured what I think it the North West's first Good Topic [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia:Featured_topic_candidates\/Grade_I_listed_buildings_in_Runcorn]. Nicely done.
[Nev1]: Don't feed the trolls and all that, even a calm remark [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk%3A71.250.206.223&diff=296231935&oldid=296229366 like this] isn't even worth the effort of typing it. The IP's been blocked now.
[Nev1]: The Salford page has been moved to [[Salford, Greater Manchester]] and turned into a disambiguation page. As a result, there are a lot of links to the wrong page. Is there any chance you could help out using AWB? At the moment, [[User:Kbthompson]] is helping out and Jza84 and I are doing the odd link by hand, but an extra pair of hands would be a great help.
[Nev1]: It's fine, I knew from your contribution log that you were offline when I asked but I thought it was worth a try. Kbthompson did a good job and it's all sorted now. Cheers,
[Nev1]: It looks like John Douglas just got [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates&curid=252388&diff=297626101&oldid=297599230 promoted] to FA, great stuff and thoroughly well deserved. I'm just disappointed I didn't get round to adding my support to the nomination!
[Nev1]: I'm about to start an article on Cheshire's Maiden Castle, and I was looking to [[Kelsborrow Castle]] to see what templates and stuff can be cannibalised as the source is the same. I was wondering if the first paragraph from the ''first hill fort'' section of the [[Maiden Castle, Dorset]], article might be worth adding? I think it gives context for why hill forts may have been built and the explanation is better than wikipedia's [[hill fort]] article, but I'm wary of putting too much weight on background information and drowning out the information specifically about Maiden Castle or Kelsborrow Castle. What do you think?
[Nev1]: Well, [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk%3ANev1&diff=297706645&oldid=297568800 you said] I should give [[Maiden Castle, Cheshire]] its own article, and since it was on my to do list that's what I've done. Unlike [[Kelsborrow Castle]], which seems to have been occupied only very briefly, there was something substantial to say about the site and I've ended up nominating it for GA. Malleus has ironed out the prose, which was hurriedly put together and I was going to re-read tomorrow as I knew it wasn't perfect, so hopefully it stands a good chance. It's not as long as [[Danebury]], and will never be as detailed as [[Maiden Castle, Dorset]], but there's not an awful lot to say about the site beyond the defences really. Even [[Mellor hill fort]] has recent excavations throwing up new information, but apparently the extent of the finds form Maiden Castle is one piece of Iron Age pottery and a tool left over from the mining. I don't think the size of the article should be a problem though given the background section. Anyway, fingers crossed.
[Nev1]: The picture of Maiden Castle isn't great, and while [[:File:Bickerton Hill.jpg|this image]] looks quite good it's unfortunately the north part of Bickerton Hill, not the south where the hill fort is. I noticed the picture of Eddisbury on commons, and there are a few ''from'' Helsby so those two are next on my list. The information seemed to sort itself really; I think with sorter articles it's practical to break it down into sections such as ''location'' and ''layout'', but for something as complex as Maiden Castle, Dorset, I think a more integrated approach is useful.
[Nev1]: I've had a go at fixing the sorting for the listed buildings around Runcorn. It works by adding <nowiki><span style=\""display:none\"">xx<\/span><\/nowiki> before each date. The table then sorts by whatever the hidden text is, so I usually go for 01, 02, 03 etc. It works fine for me, but you might want to check for yourself. The only problem is deciding where early\/mid\/late go, but see what you think of the order I've chosen.
[Nev1]: If you've got a moment, I'd like your thoughts on the above list. The aim is to eventually take it to FLC and was prompted by [[Wikipedia:Peer review\/List of World Heritage Sites in the Netherlands\/archive1|this peer review]]. I've only done a couple of sites so far to see how it works, but I'm whether to do one table of the current sites or to split it by country as the previous list was laid out. Also, do you think there's any important information that's missing from the columns? There's a long way to go, but I'm addressing the table first and the lead last.
[Nev1]: Fair enough, it gives me time to do a few more entries. Take as much time as you need. It will certainly keep me busy for a while, but seeing as most of the articles on UK World Heritage Sites are in a pretty poor condition I think a good list would be of use to the reader. {{user|Doncram}} has stated that he's planning an overhaul of the lists but hasn't responded to my query about the format his plans take so I'm going to try and get there first.
[Nev1]: I too think the list is good, fingers crossed that FLC isn't too problematic. I've got the page on my watchlist in case the situation starts getting tricky (as it did for Runcorn's rural listed buildings) so you won't be alone. My only suggestion for the list is that in the last paragraph it might be worth explaining what a listed building is and that some of Douglas' works have been deemed historically and architecturally important enough to warrant protection. At the moment, an American reader might wonder what the final \""Grade\"" column means.
[Nev1]: As for the overseas territories, UNESCO lists them under the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, so since it's verifiable I suppose it should stay. Agree it's not ideal though, but I'll just have to explain it in the lead. I agree with you about the UNESCO reference column; perhaps it could be solved by adding a key of some sort or a footnote explaining it. One thing I intend to explain in the lead is the whole natural.artificial\/mixed sites issue; I was originally thinking of colour coding the table to indicate which was which, but I don't like that idea so I could explain in the lead which sites are natural or mixed as the vast majority are artificial. I will be making a separate table within the same page for the tentative list, although getting information for it may be less easy.
[Nev1]: Well done, another article that's a credit to Cheshire and it's unique history.
[Nev1]: Congratulations on getting the article FL status. It's well deserved and the issues raised over naming etc in the FLC should make it easier for any future FLCs of the Douglas lists.
[Nev1]: Am I missing something? Bots take care of double redirects and have done for a while.
[Nev1]: <s>Not sure if you've noticed, but [[WP:ALT|alt text]] is now part of the [[WP:FL?|FL criteria]] (\""images... with succinct captions and alternative (alt) text if necessary\""). It can be added by adding \""|alt=Description of the image\"" to the image code.

[Nev1]: I think {{user|Harrias}} is a Somerset fan, it might be worth asking if he's able to help.
[Nev1]: Have you thought about taking the article on Peckforton Castle to GAN? Aside from one fairly inconsequential <nowiki>{{fact}}<\/nowiki> tag it's a well-referenced article and I can't imagine there being much more to add, I just hadn't really looked at it properly since it's not a medieval castle (it's interesting that some people thought Tollemache was building it as a practical defence rather than just a status symbol).
[Nev1]: It seems that you've started half the articles on English castles and you've got Beeston and Halton up to GA, so I was wondering what you thought of the main [[castle]] article. I got sick of the article being in such a poor state so have essentially rewritten it with the intention of taking it to FAC. I'm seeking input from as many people as possible to ensure all the bases are covered.
[Nev1]: Good grief, how on earth did I forget [http:\/\/toolserver.org\/~daniel\/WikiSense\/Contributors.php?wikilang=en&wikifam=.wikipedia.org&grouped=on&page=Beeston+Castle that]?! I only got to visit for the first time recently, it's an incredible place and there are some fantastic views. It wasn't until then I realised how rubbish [[:File:Beeston Castle by Buck Bros.jpg|this picture]] is! I should have taken more pictures for the article, but as I've already demonstrated my memory makes a sieve look good at retention :-)
[Nev1]: I think the content issues you raised at the FAC (ie: non-image) are about as resolved as they're going to get. [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AFeatured_article_candidates%2FCastle%2Farchive1&action=historysubmit&diff=328661129&oldid=328660605] [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AFeatured_article_candidates%2FCastle%2Farchive1&action=historysubmit&diff=329119868&oldid=328859110] Regarding the prose, I've replied to all of your points on the talk page bar one, as the information about when boys came of age escapes me at the moment, and I'm struggling for a source. As for the images, thank you for your patience (and perseverence), I'm quite sure it's felt like you've been hanging your head against a wall as I seem to have developed a blind spot in that area during this FAC.
[Nev1]: Hi, the following sentence feels like it's missing something: \""Through out his career on King James' Daemonlogie, and it has been suggested this indicates that one of his motivations was that he believed in the reality of witchcraft\"". The part before the comma doesn't seem to link to the part after.
[Nev1]: Does this convey what you meant accurately: \""Because of Hopkin's use of  ''Daemonlogie'' throughout his career, it has been suggested that one of the motives behind Hopkin's work was a belief in witchcraft\""?
[Nev1]: Hi, I've reverted your addition of an image of the above castle to the [[castle]] article and thought it best to more fully explain myself here than in an edit summary. The manual of style asks not to sandwich text between two images in the manner that Rapperswil and Castle Rising were. Partly, that's because there are so many images in the castle. The images currently used have been chosen because they relate directly to the text and illustrate a particular architectural development. For example, Castle Rising illustrates well a developed donjon from the early period, and the Crusader castle neatly ties in with the information on castles in the East and their influence. Unfortunately, the slightly cluttered image of Rapperswil didn't fit into the section it had been inserted. However, castles are always a popular subject, so have you considered nominating Rapperswil Castle at [[T:TDYK]]?
[Nev1]: Well I suppose castles are my \""thing\"", so I've gone ahead and [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Template_talk%3ADid_you_know&action=historysubmit&diff=334136857&oldid=334136729 nominated] it. I may come asking for help with references if the folks over at DYK want more, but hopefully it will end up on the main page. It should get a few views, especially if they decide to use the image. Happy editing and happy holidays!
[Nev1]: Despite the hook being sourced, it looks like DYK wants a few more references (about [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Template_talk%3ADid_you_know&action=historysubmit&diff=335631454&oldid=335631011 one per paragraph]); if you've got time it would be handy to add a few (it might just be an issue of duplicating the existing refs).
[Nev1]: In this instance, forcing the image size was important. Each image needs to be assessed before the size is decided on. Please bear in mind how the detail of an image will be effected when changing how it is displayed. Happy editing,
[Nev1]: Hi,  can you help me out with the status of the above image? It's been  redrawn from a plan in a copyrighted book, so I'm not sure whether it's  free use or not.
[Nev1]: Hi, Mike, could you forward me a copy of the review of the above article mentioned [http:\/\/www.uic.edu\/htbin\/cgiwrap\/bin\/ojs\/index.php\/fm\/article\/view\/2721\/2482 here]? I'd be interested to see what improvements were suggested. Thanks,
[Nev1]: I am against including the likes of Disneyland's castle in the article as it's simply not relevant. If you read the article, it explains the definition and later on details mock castles, [[folly]]s, and artificial ruins. That is the influence of castles. That a theme park or two decided to built its own imitation castle is not relevant, and certainly does not belong in the lead.
[Nev1]: Let's reverse it: why include [[Sleeping Beauty Castle]] at all? It's an example of a mock castle, but there are already several examples in the article. We can't list every single one, it simply wouldn't be practical. The ones currently used are the best architectural examples. You will also notice that aside from the images, specific castles are not mentioned in the lead. This is because it should be a summary of the article and detail general trends in the development of castles. Disneyland may call its structure a castle, but how does it fit the definition laid out in [[Castle#Defining characteristics]], as supported by academic sources. Simply because someone decided it should be called a castle does not mean it is one. Mock castles and the like are mentioned not because they ''are'' castles, but because they were ''influenced'' by castle architecture.
[Nev1]: You're going to tell that to {{user|Arthur Rubin}} too, [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Gun_Powder_Ma&diff=prev&oldid=357496189 right]?

[Nev1]: I think the reason there's been no input so far is you didn't use the GAR template.
[Nev1]: I think (not started a GAR myself) that it should be at [[Wikipedia:Good article reassessment\/Romano-Chinese relations\/1]], for example the GAR for [[Winston Churchill]] was at [[Wikipedia:Good article reassessment\/Winston Churchill\/1]].
[Nev1]: Don't know if you've seen, but [[Norton Priory]] has been selected as the TFA for [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Talk:Norton_Priory&curid=8823562&diff=379540672&oldid=370997205 the 22nd].
[Nev1]: It's an easy template to use... as long as you do it from the start. I generally use the template in most articles I put together now, but I'd hate to convert the references in either [[Sale, Greater Manchester]] or [[Maiden Castle, Dorset]]. It would be a lot of effort, and considering the way they're formatted is fine at the moment I don't see the need. As long as the reference style is consistent within one article that's fine, and which you use is a matter of personal taste. The [[Tower of London]] has a couple of ODNB sources which work fine, so you can take a look at how that's done. I just treated it as a book which happened to have a url and didn't worry about the page numbers.
[Nev1]: Cook's getting a lot of attention, would you like me to semi-protect the article so you can stay on top of the changes?
[Nev1]: Ok, semi-protected for three days. That will sort the article out till the end of the Test. If it starts up again (and hopefully he does keep in the runs) let me know and I can re-protect the article.
[Nev1]: Once again, well done on the revamp of Windsor Castle, it's a very impressive piece of work. I was wondering if you'd considered taking it through [[WP:FAC]]? I [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User_talk:Malleus_Fatuorum#Windsor_Castle asked] {{user|Malleus Fatuorum}}, who's shepherded more than his fair share of articles through the process, what he thought of it and he seems impressed too.
[Nev1]: Taking [[castle]] through FAC isn't really comparable to an individual castle the issues involved were completely different such  scope. The candidacy for the Tower is [[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates\/Tower of London\/archive1|here]] and might be worth reading through. For the most part it was ok; it got plenty of attention because everyone's heard of it. I was able to deal with concerns about prose. The only significant sticking point was SlimVirgin's oppose. While acquiessing to a reviewer's every request may make the ride smoother, ensuring the quality of the article is the main point. If you provide a rationale why you don't think a suggested change is necessary the FAC delegates will take that into account. A case in point is one of the reasons SlimVirgin opposed was \""the Tower of London was an important and notorious English prison, but there is little mention of that in the article\"". In response I was able to provide numerous instances where the Tower's role as a prison was mentioned in the text. Overall it's a rigorous experience, but as long as you stay calm when faced with opinions you may disagree with there's often something to take out of it to improve the article. With Windsor I think you may have an easier ride as it's image isn't as dark as the Tower's.
[Nev1]: If it was my article I'd probably skip GAC. Once the content is there, I find GAC can be a useful stepping stone to smooth out the prose, but I think in this case it's up to scratch and in any case you can't be sure when your article will be reviewed at GAC.
[Nev1]: I've found some stuff on [http:\/\/www.heacademy.ac.uk\/assets\/hlst\/documents\/resources\/ispal\/B24.pdf visitor numbers]; they seem to hover around 900,000. Just a note that alt text is useful, but isn't a [[WP:FA?|FA requirement]] any more.
[Nev1]: Hope you don't mind me butting in, but you didn't have the \""reviewer right\"", which means you couldn't accept pending changes. I've [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Special:Log&type=rights&user=Nev1&page=&year=2010&month=12&tagfilter=&hide_patrol_log=1&hide_review_log=1 changed that] so you shouldn't have a problem with your edits needing to be accepted now. To see what rights you have you can use [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Special:ListUsers&limit=1&username=Doktorbuk this link].
[Nev1]: Mdashes shouldn't be spaced per [[MOS:DASH]], as was your edit [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Lindow_Man&action=historysubmit&diff=404329810&oldid=404329348 here]. Please also take a look at [[WP:NBSP]], and per [[WP:PERCENT]] there should not be a space between numbers and % symbols as you did [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Lindow_Man&diff=prev&oldid=404329348 here]. In light of that, you may want to take another look at your edits to the [[Ming Dynasty]] article where you have introduced spaced mdashes.
[Nev1]: Your edits to the Lindow Man articles, such as [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Lindow_Man&diff=prev&oldid=404333623 this], are going against the [[WP:MOS|manual of style]] and are becoming disruptive. Please stop.
[Nev1]: It's perfectly ok to make lots of individual edits rather than fewer big ones. People have their own way of editing and should do whatever works for them.
[Nev1]: I've just found that the same user responsible for [[de Lacy]], {{user|Selkcerf0142}} also [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Clitheroe_Castle&action=historysubmit&diff=403976345&oldid=395019277 added] a lot of copyrighted material to the article on [[Clitheroe Castle]] around the same time. If it happened once...
[Nev1]: Am I [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Baiae&action=historysubmit&diff=410273348&oldid=410270990 missing something]? I was [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Talk:Baiae&oldid=410042092#Copyright_violation pretty sure] this is a copyright violation.
[Nev1]: There is a thread at [[WP:ANI]] concerning you.
[Nev1]: I've [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Castles_in_Great_Britain_and_Ireland&action=historysubmit&diff=425367047&oldid=425303723 undone] some of the copyediting {{user|Philg88}} did over at [[castles in Great Britain and Ireland]] as in some cases the meaning was changed. I might revert the rest later, but I think you'll want to take a look at the changes yourself. The mission of the Guild of Copy Editors is certainly laudable but can be a bit of a mixed bag; in future I'd recommend finding someone whose standard of writing you are familiar with.
[Nev1]: I'd be interested to see the original source as I think \""Custom of Chester\"" may not be a defined term. Is there anything more specific than Roll 3 Edw. II? Comparing Halifax with Cheshire is also problematic as Cheshire was a [[county palatine]] and the earl had far greater power than earls in non-palatine counties. Palatine earls were the highest authority in their counties and often did not need to defer to royal judgement, so the case of Halifax may be more exceptional when compared to places other than Cheshire.
[Nev1]: Assuming the co-ordinates are correct ({{gbmapping|TL022814}}) then the castle is in the village of Thorpe Waterville and you can see for yourself on Google maps by following the linked co-ordinates. Thrapston is about two and a half miles away and is a larger settlement.
[Nev1]: You've explained what Test cricket is, which is a good start, and the brief explanation of what a century is was necessary. The third sentence is oddly phrased, but it might just need tweaking to say that Sri Lanka, Ireland, and the Netherlands have played the fewest matches. As for expanding the lead, I think you can draw on a few points from the table. For instance who score the fastest century in terms of balls faced? Who scored the slowest? (These two might be tricky as the table gives balls faced for the entire innings.) Is it worth noting how many centuries have been scored for each country? If possible, it might also be handy to include a smaller table showing how many Tests each country has played; this would give the reader an idea whether Australia's 30 centuries is in proportion to India's ten and I'd be interested to see who the ten are as Ireland is amongst them. In more general terms, the lead might provide an opportunity to expand a little on the history of women's Test cricket. It's already mentioned that the first match was played in 1934 between England and Australia, but perhaps more detail could be added such as when other teams played their first Tests.
[Nev1]: As the figures are incomplete, leaving out fastest\/slowest centuries is fair enough. And the table headings are pretty much what I had in mind for the countries. Cricinfo has [http:\/\/stats.espncricinfo.com\/ci\/engine\/records\/index.html?class=8 a couple of lists] related to Test centuries in women's cricket so they might be worth checking out for ideas.
[Nev1]: Hope it's ok to butt in... anyway I think ditching the list format for the exhibitions is a step in the right direction, but where to go from there I'm not too sure. It seems to have hosted in the region of 40 exhibits, and explaining each one would be a lot of prose. Are they all really worth a sentence? Maybe the notable ones should be highlighted, but then there's the editorial choice of which ones are 'notable'. I wonder how many of those exhibitions were award winning.
[Nev1]: Thanks for [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Manchester&action=historysubmit&diff=439224897&oldid=439168100 adding references] to the Manchester article. In future, it would be helpful to include other information such as the publisher and the date the website was accessed on (if you're using a web page). It would also be useful if you could format the references you add in the same style as the article already has to ensure consistency within individual articles. Thanks,
[Nev1]: Coverage from the BBC or a national newspaper such as ''The Guardian'' seems like a good place to start, but wouldn't the ''Evening News'' contain pieces on pretty much all of the Urbis' exhibits as part of its coverage of what's going on in Manchester?
[Nev1]: I suggest you revert [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Zaheer_Khan&action=historysubmit&diff=439782043&oldid=439663275 this edit] in which you mistakenly characterise my actions as vandalism and pay more attention when using automated tools such as Twinkle.
[Nev1]: I have replied at the noticeboard.
[Nev1]: I'm not sure what the opening sentence is supposed to convey that the rest can't, but it is an improvement.
[Nev1]: If either of you is going to do a list of castles for Somerset, I could give you the names Cathcart King gives in ''Castellarium Anglicanum'' if you think it would be useful?
[Nev1]: ''Castellarium Anglicanum'' can be a tricky pair of books to lay your hands on, but it certainly is handy. I provided OS grid co-ordinates so you can check against the Gatehouse website. King is sometimes a bit hit and miss with 'vanished' castles; they're supposed to be sites where the location is uncertain but the documentary evidence suggests a castle did exist, or no remains survive, however I have come across a few examples where the site is securely known or there are earthworks listed as vanished. For the most part he is correct though. I took a look at [[:Category:Castles in Somerset]] for comparison. [[Crewkerne Castle]] seems to be the only one that King didn't include ([[Midford Castle]] is an 18th century folly). I'm not entirely sure why, it may just be the case that when dealing with over 1,500 sites in England alone some might fall through the cracks due to human error.
[Nev1]: I think [[List of castles in Somerset]] (lower case ''castle'' is a good title). I forgot to mention that Cathcart King uses the pre-1974 county boundaries. [http:\/\/homepage.mac.com\/philipdavis\/English%20sites\/3288.html The Gatehouse] takes the stance that Wimble Toot isn't a castle. The [http:\/\/webapp1.somerset.gov.uk\/her\/details.asp?prn=53520 Somerset HER] mentions that the site has been suggested as a castle but has no further details. It's interesting that very little has been written about Wimble Toot, although Mike Salter in his own list of castles in Wessex seems to have included it (I'd be interested to see what he says) but this is probably because as far as I can tell his own lists are based largely on Cathcart King's. I'd like to know what Stuart Prior has to say on the matter though...
[Nev1]: That said, if some kind of section could be put together for castles of the Anarchy for instance, I think it would be very useful as readers might not be familiar with the historical context. For castles immediately after the Conquest I think maybe a couple of sentences would be enough to put a particular castle in context as the Norman Conquest is cultural shorthand and something taught in primary schools.
[Nev1]: Fair enough, it happens. The line I take is that if stuff is has been recently added to an article the editor who contributed it can reasonably be expected to add a citation if they think what they wrote is important. For older material I'm slightly more circumspect as if every unsourced statement on Wikipedia was removed there wouldn't be much of an encyclopedia left.
[Nev1]: For the lead image of [[list of castles in Cheshire]] I chose [[Chester Castle]] as it was arguably the most important castle in the county. Although the image isn't inspiring, and indeed not much of the medieval structure remains, it was the only royal castle in Cheshire, after it passed out of royal control it was the seat of power for the earls of Chester, and was in use for centuries. While Chester was an obvious choice there weren't many other striking photos available, which is a shame as [[Beeston Castle|Beeston]] is a remarkable sight but Wikipedia doesn't really have a photo that does it justice. In the Somerset list, the photo of [[Nunney Castle]] stands out.
[Nev1]: As I feared at the time, other commitments got in the way and this slipped my mind once I had free time again. Although more recently I've had a bit more time on my hands that's about to change again. It is still on my to do list. It's certainly an improvement, and hopefully enough to prevent the merger. Ward's a good source, and I'll see if www.british-history.ac.uk has the relevant volumes of the Victoria County History.
[Nev1]: I've only had time for a quick skim, but it looks like another excellent piece of work. In the meantime I'm trying to clean up some copyright issues related to [[Rochdale Town Hall]] and sort out the muddle statistics in the Manchester article.
[Nev1]: This looks set to be a tricky one. The mention of Heaton, Butler and Bayne [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Rochdale_Town_Hall&diff=prev&oldid=338244156 originates with me] and I appear to have used some sloppy wording which hasn't helped matters. I don't have the 2004 edition to hand, but in the 1969 version Pevsner (p.377) says \""Stone carving is by ''G. Law'' of Rochdale, wood carving by ''Earp'' of London, stained glass and wall painting by ''Heaton, Butler & Bayne''.\"" Carvings obviously count as decoration, so I'm not sure how I got that wrong. The [http:\/\/www.imagesofengland.org.uk\/Details\/Default.aspx?id=358886 Images of England record], which also mentions HB&B, says that William Morris is the man responsible for the four seasons stained glass and some wall paintings. Reference five is a book, so quotes from it may not show up on line. When the harvnb template didn't work when I clicked on it I was stumped for a moment but it can only relate to Rochdale Metropolitan Borough Council (N.D.), ''Metropolitan Rochdale Official Guide'', Ed. J. Burrow & Co. After finding an example of my own imprecise interpretation of the sources I'm still a bit uneasy about the article.
[Nev1]: Thanks, I'll take care of that.
[Nev1]: I think that originally the article had a ribbon of images down the right hand side and at some point it got turned into a gallery. The coverage of Cheshire's castles with regards to images is patchy so not each site has its own.
[Nev1]: With the map at the top I don;t think you need another lead image.
[Nev1]: No amount of wriggling will make [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJ3Mrs&action=historysubmit&diff=441948266&oldid=441420638 edits such as this] acceptable from an experienced editor. If you feel I have spoken to you harshly it is precisely because you are experienced and should know damn well better. You are of course welcome back when you decide to grow up. Goodbye."

[JamesAM]: Transity, I notice that, like me, many of your fixes are for [[LAPD]]. So I think we're being affected by the same problem. --
[JamesAM]: Frankly, my opinion is the opposite of yours. I think the page does a good job of reaching the proper balance and if it had been whitewashed, that would be a travesty. The article isn't POV. It doesn't call Frey a jerk. It simply documents what happened. If that makes people feel badly about him, that's not the editors' fault. A bio page should serve the truth. Fans should change pages to boost their heroes. [[Dwight Gooden]] was my favorite athlete when I was a kid. I don't try to strip out the discussion of his problems with drugs and the law (including a mention in the lede), because that would go against my duty as a wikipedia editor. The content should be determined by the facts as shown in reliability sources, not by the vigor of each person's fans in removing info they dislike. It would be a bad double-standard if Frey's page minimized things just because he has vigorous supporters. Your proposed lede would be unnecessarily vague. Frey has admitted that portions of his memoir were untrue so we don't have to pretend its unknown. --
[JamesAM]: You wrote, \""I knew you would see it so I didn't think to send you a notice.\"" In fact, the only reason I saw the discussion is because another alerted me that I was mentioned in a discussion and might want to reply. If not for that editor's note on my Talk page, I would never have realized I was being disparaged on that page. Ideally, we should discuss article content rather than the character of editors. But it's hard to avoid rebutting when I think I'm being attacked personally. --"
Rick570,False,"[Rick570]: I have an extract from the hard copy of the New Zealand Herald, Friday , June 15, 2007, Section A, page 2, \""GO-ahead for new Mt eden jail, by Elizabeth Binning (police reporter).

Could you give me the text concerned, explain how was promulgated, and how such laws can be easily accessed? Thank you very much for your guidance in this matter. Knd regards.

W Nowicki,False,"[W Nowicki]: 
[W Nowicki]: I do not understand your reverting the recent edit of [[Hawaii overprint note]]. If you follow the link to the article on [[Oahu Cemetery]], you will see that it was also called \""Nu{{okina}}uanu\"" at times. It is on the island of O{{okina}}ahu (and that is its official name), but in the Nu{{okina}}uanu Valley, so that is what locals call it. Why did you take out the link to the cemetery? And why did you take out the category [[:Category: History of Oahu]]? Do you contend that it did not take place on that island? And why did you change the link to [[crematory]], which describes the facility used, to [[crematorium]] which redirect to cremation describing the funeral process? The article does not refer to burning bodies, but paper money. Did you actually read the changes before reverting? The raw link you added (http:\/\/www.nmplimited.com\/Index.htm) points to a placeholder page that says \""under construction\""? The [[Oahu Cemetery]] article has a source that appeared in a refereed academic journal. Please reconsider. Aloha.
[W Nowicki]: If you would have kept the link to the Oahu Cemetery article in, then they could have clicked on that to find out the location of it in Nu{{okina}}uanu valley on Nu{{okina}}uanu  Avenue for starters. Why obscure that fact and mislead readers into thinking there are two different ones? If you really insist a simple \""[[Oahu Cemetery]] (known by locals as Nu{{okina}}uanu  Mortuary)\"" would be less misleading. Someone who really does want to fact check could also then find the Journal article cited for example. Also just found a source in \""The Numismatist\"". So if I corrected the article again, would you back it out and mediation be needed?
[W Nowicki]: and sorry for letting 'mer'canisms slip in. Thanks for the help filling in  and improving the quality.
[W Nowicki]: if you have the time, could you clarify if by \""Hawaiian English\"" you really meant [[Hawaiian Pidgin]] (Hawaiian Creole English) which is where [[Hawaiian English]] goes, or as I suspect you meant \""typography of [[Hawaiian language]] inteneded for English speakers\"" (e.g. with 'okina and kahko? Thanks.
[W Nowicki]: A related issue I ran across was [[front-side bus]]. It seems to have been created as [[front side bus]] but moved without comment two years ago? Intel seems to consistently not use hyphen, so perhaps worth a move request. I do agree than \""frontside bus\"" is more German than English, which is the only comment in the talk page.
[W Nowicki]: Hello, it looks like you are one of the few with the patience to help improve the sorry state of the computer-related articles. So what do you think of my idea of expanding this one into a historic narrative with links to more specific articles, etc.? Then we can either change [[system bus model]] to a redirect, or do yet another RfD or Prod. The [[von Neumann architecture]] article also needs more help, but that can be done over time since the sources are myriad. The diagrams might also need some work, but I am not an .svg expert (yet?). Is this reasonable? Thanks for any feedback.
[W Nowicki]: Oh yes, agree that more could certainly be added. That is why I rated it \""start\"" since it is far from complete. Mostly I first wanted to add enough that it would survive a request for deletion. Especially the end needs to add the issues of \""divergence\"" with multi-processors, cache levels and bus hierarchies, vs. smaller cheaper processors. I just had the sources handy for the earlier period so started with that. If I can get Inkscape to work, perhaps other articles could use diagrams too to cut through some of the jargon.
[W Nowicki]: Hello, an update: the AfD was closed with lack of consensus. I waffled a bit since I wanted to create a [[system bus]] article which I have done now. I suspect that removed most of the objections to the deletion, so the question is what to do next. You seem the original author? In particular, there is some discussion of the main source used, which appears to have some errors or at least glosses over details. There also seems a new version of the book is out, but we only have a snippet view. So if you have the original source, your opinion would be greatly appreciated at the [[Talk:System bus model|talk page]]. Thanks much.
[W Nowicki]: Also you seem the original uploader (three years ago) of [[:File:Systembusmodel.png]] which I redid with Inkscape as [[:File:Computer system bus.svg]]. I also fixed what seems an error. The CPU is equal to the ALU, registers, and controls, not part of the box. Does this seem reasonable? Also I credited where the diagram seems to come, although it is probably widely done similarly.
[W Nowicki]: Perhaps a bit late, but I might have some time to work on this too, at least for now. Seems worthwhile.
[W Nowicki]: 
[W Nowicki]: Replied on the [[Talk:Medium dependent interface]] page since it was anonymous.
[W Nowicki]: Yes, you are right, I need to dust off the \u02bb\u014cp\u016bkaha\u02bbia article and get it out of my user space. I was frustrated by the complaints from Chris Cook who had the web site set up for him. But might as well get it published instaed of sitting there gathering dust. Give me a few days to finish up other stuff.
[W Nowicki]: Bonjour. Moi aussi, after merging a few of the  projects into the prose I came to a similar conclusion, so did not proceed. My first thinking was that if someone went through the trouble of creating an article at one time, it would be sad to have that information disappear totally. Most of the articles are written so badly (mostly fluff from the grant applications) they are going away eventually as they should. However, there are a lot more of them than I first realized, so not sure what to do. I thought perhaps a table, but if there are a thousand that would not work. Some might be notable (if they continued under subsequent programmes, or get notable papers published, spin off viable products etc). The programs (sorry, programmes, 'mercanism) deserve more than the small article that the \""Framework\"" is turning into after the fluffy language gets excised from that too. Probably further discussion merited on the talk page, although not sure active editors are watching it any more, sigh. Thanks for any suggestions.
[W Nowicki]: Somewhat related, the [[Portal:Grid computing]] needs discussion. Thanks again.
[W Nowicki]: I can guess. The only grants I was involved in were [[DARPA]], which were just based on being lucky enough to know the right people, mostly. I do hear that NIH grants are mostly based on what congresional district one is in. Well, hope someone has time to work on these, except deleting them as they \""time out\""."

[Primetime]: Hi, Regarding the word ''embarrass,'' the word entered the English language through French, but into French from Spanish.<sup>[http:\/\/www.m-w.com\/dictionary\/embarrass]<\/sup> Best
[Primetime]: You just made up that bit about it being from Latin. It's likely originally from an Iberian Celtic language. If you'd like to learn more about the word ''[[embarazar]]'' feel free to read the article I wrote about it. --
[Primetime]: :Come to think of it: almost all words in Spanish, English, etc., are derived from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]]. For example, the \""List of Spanish words derived from Arabic,\"" page is technically incorrect because many of those words came from [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]. So, perhaps a note should be added to these pages specifying that it's for words ''directly'' derived from Language X. --
[Primetime]: The argument is largely over. But I want to re-emphasize just what an encylcopedia is by asking you to read these definitions from reliable dictionaries: ''[http:\/\/encarta.msn.com\/encnet\/features\/dictionary\/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861608325 Funk and Wagnall's (Encarta),] [http:\/\/www.askoxford.com\/concise_oed\/encyclopedia?view=uk Oxford Concise,] [http:\/\/www.m-w.com\/cgi-bin\/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=encyclopedia Merriam-Webster's Collegiate,] [http:\/\/www.infoplease.com\/dictionary\/encyclopedia Random House Unabridged,] [http:\/\/dictionary.cambridge.org\/define.asp?key=25549&dict=CALD Cambridge,]'' and ''[http:\/\/www.bartleby.com\/65\/en\/encyclop.html The American Heritage Dictionary.]'' They all emphasize how encyclopedias cover all fields of knowledge (or rarely, everything about one subject [e.g., literature]). You are advocating moving a two-page article from an ''encyclopedia'' onto a site for ''books''. Think about how ridiculous that seems. It doesn't help that moving it there would make the entry nearly impossible to find (as no one would look for it there and few visit the site).--
[Primetime]: Not true. I can debate this forever with you if you'd like. Many people come to Wikipedia through Google. I have observed that the larger I make my articles on Wikipedia, the more visitors it attracts, and the more prominence it gets in Google searches. Thus, in the future, when someone searches for ''embarazada'' in Google, my page will be displayed first. Further, Wikipedia is searched using [http:\/\/www.onelook.com\/ OneLook Dictionary Search] along with other reference works.<p>As for other encyclopedias that define words, I already mentioned the [[Enciclopedia universal ilustrada europeo-americana]]. There's also any of the encyclopedias made by [[Larousse]]. As for quoting me out of context, you said \""but specifically asked people (most of them very new to WP) to support him 'as a favor' (or even 'a huge favor'): 'I would be greatly in your debt'\"". That's a misquote as I did not ask anyone to support me.--"
Brianboulton,True,"[Brianboulton]: All else I'm fine with.  I was a bit disturbed, though, to see the note about \""28 intermediate revisions not shown\"". What can they be?
[Brianboulton]: Mike, please take a look at this map of Ross Island & tell me if you think it's worth considering.  When it's enlarged you can read the details - Cape Crozier, Cape Evans, Hut Point and one or two other relevant places.  I know it's restricted to one area, but with a suitably explanatory caption it could be useful, maybe.
[Brianboulton]: You did a good copyedit on my Terra Nova article. I wonder if you have time for a similar job on my [[Discovery Expedition]] article which is FAC at the moment.  One of the comments is that some of the prose is \""awkward\"", but he doesn't specify where. The article could surely do with a fresh eye so, if you can find time I'd be grateful.
[Brianboulton]: Thanks for your reply & willingness to copyedit Discovery Expedition.  There's no indication that on the discussion page that its FAC has been archived.  I'm in the middle of dealing with a raft of 20-odd points that have been posted just today!
[Brianboulton]: I undersatnd the position & have just had a message from Ealdgyth.  If you are prepared to copyedit, can I suggest you wait a day or two until I have dealt with her points? The copyedit might be easier then. Thanks
[Brianboulton]: 
[Brianboulton]: Ealdgyth has now indicated support so I have renominated. Here we go!
[Brianboulton]: I saw your response to the comment about the positioning of the left-aligned pictures in the Discovery article.  The Ross picture looks wrong on the right, because he is looking to the right, away from the article.  The penguin picture can easily be moved down its paragraph, and I have temporarily done this.  Can you see what you think? I'll shift Ross if I have to, but I'd rather not.
[Brianboulton]: Whatever Devon may be called now, it was most definitely known as Devonshire when Robert Falcon Scott was born in 1868. Lots of counties have changed their names since then. One tends to use the name of the time, e.g. you wouldn't use modern county names such as Avon, Cumbria etc. Also, Cornwall was never known as \""Cornwallshire\"".
[Brianboulton]: Dukes of Devonshire, Devonshire cream, etc.....My old school atlas says Devonshire. But I'm not going to change your edit. Devon is good enough.
[Brianboulton]: There are plenty of other potential featured topics within the polar history umbrella. One I would dearly like to work on, when time permits, is \""Ships of the polar explorers\"". I hope also soon to begin a series of North Pole articles - I am visiting the Arctic myself in mid-September.  If you have any particular ideas you would like to discuss, in relation to current or feature topics, please feel free to contact me on my talkpage. Regards,
[Brianboulton]: Finally, good luck in whatever you decide to do, and I am happy to co-operate wherever possible.
[Brianboulton]: Thought you would like to know that while you were away the image storm that was brewing seems to have blown itself out - I trust. However, the satellite image of Elephant Island that we wrestled over has had to go; apparently the source image was not free and permssion would be required to use it (see User:Elcobbola on FAC page). I have replaced it with a photograph of the party arriving on the island, and you might care to take a look when time permits. Thanks, anyway, for the help you have given with this article's images - which have proved an unexpectedly bothersome issue.
[Brianboulton]: Article was promoted 30 August. Thanks indeed.
[Brianboulton]: Nice of you to show interest. Current project is [[Southern Cross Expedition]], currently at PR. Image issues to be resolved. The main Antarctic expedition and biographical articles are all done - I'm working on the lesser-known expeditions and supporting figures. I'm  hoping to help another editor to get [[Tom Crean]] to FA. I'm also turning my attention northward - going on a trip to the Arctic in 2 weeks to take some photos.
[Brianboulton]: I've just seen the review medal you sent me for Proserpine. That was most kind. If anyone deserves a medal it's you, if only for your willingness to tackle image reviewing - in addition to your already vast workload.  I'd send you a medal myself, but I'm too stooopid to know how to do it, so you'll just have to bask in my warm thanks.
[Brianboulton]: Mike, I guess you are pretty busy at the moment, but if is at all possible, could you cast a reviewer's swift eye over [[Rhinemaidens (Wagner)]] at peer review? It's not a popular topic, I know &ndash; the article waited for ages for its GA review, and it might wait as long at PR.  But it needs a cold eye cast on it by someone fresh. If it's not possible for you, I fully understand, but I thought I'd ask.
[Brianboulton]: During the peer review you suggested that the formal name of this article should be [[Rhinemaidens]], with [[Rhinemaidens (Wagner)]] linked to it. There seems to be consensus on this move, which will require admin action. Could you do this, please? Thanks,
[Brianboulton]: Sorry to have troubled you - I assumed you were. I have now asked an admin to do this. Incidentally, you may like to know that the article is now at FAC.
[Brianboulton]: Mike, I notice that Amazing Stories has a co-nom. When I put Peter as a co-nom on the Rhinemaidens article I mucked up the procedure somewhat. This is not unusual - I am a total dunce in understanding such matters. Can you tell me, briefly, what the procedure is, as I am considering another co-nom and I don't want to foul up again? Many thanks,
[Brianboulton]: Talk about the blind leading the blind. Thanks, I'll follow what you did (based on what I did) and see where we end up! Gawd 'elp us!
[Brianboulton]: I think Peter and I have dealt with the points you raised - if you have a moment please take a look.
[Brianboulton]: Thanks for your untiring efforts to get things right. You will see from the FAC page that I have discovered how to get the entry name into the Randel source, and I believe that really does wrap that one up. I note your aversion to templates, probably well justified, but it doesn't help when editors (e.g. me) don't use them properly.
[Brianboulton]: ''Vollendet das ewige Werke!'' The Rhine daughters have a new gold toy. Thanks, again, for your patient reviewing, and for sorting out the troubling image. Today, assuming the PR is still open, I intend to return to [[Reception history of Jane Austen]], as I have a few (very few) comments about this excellent article.
[Brianboulton]: Would it be possible amid your many activities for you to look at this new Mozart article which is now on peer review: [[WP:Peer review|Mozart family Grand Tour\/archive 1]]? It's part musical, part European travelogue. Any comments that you leave, and any problems over the images, will be ''very much'' appreciated.
[Brianboulton]: It was very kind of you to award me the Polar Medal, which places me in very august company. It was most timely, too, because today, 7 November, is the ''first anniversary'' of my Wikipedia editing (apart from a few earlier IP experiments). [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Aeneas_Mackintosh&diff=169981846&oldid=169981461 This] was my first posting of an article, on 7 November 2007. Please note my strict adherence to article structure and [[WP:MOS]], my scrupulous attention to in-line citations and listing of sources, and my careful selection of images. Anyway, thank you for your continuing support for these polar articles and for your constructive review comments.
[Brianboulton]: On the [[Mozart family Grand Tour]] peer review you queried the de Carmontelle watercolour which may or may not have been scanned from Solomon's book. Well, what about [[:Image:Mozart family crop.jpg|this]], a slightly cropped version which I scanned myself from Jane Glover's book? With your Elcobbola hat on, does this pass muster? If so I'l put it in.
[Brianboulton]: It's good to see that you're around a bit, if not fully in harness, and I hope your recovery continues. If it would help you, I will be happy to finish off the GA (NRG) reviews in your name which are presently on hold. Just say the word.
[Brianboulton]: I have copyedited the first half of the article - you had better check that you are happy with what I've done. I will do my best to finish the copyedit on Monday as I am then away for several days, and I'd like to leave a comment at FAC before I go.
[Brianboulton]: Mike, I wonder if at some time you could look at [[New South Greenland]] on peer review? This is a change from my usual fare of expedition articles, but it might make a pleasing aperetif. I'd welcome any comments you have.
[Brianboulton]: Thanks for the excellent and thorough review, which I have transferred to the Peer Review page, where I have responded. The article has benefitted greatly from your suggestions. I would be most grateful if you could visit that page to check whether my responses have dealt adequately with the points you identified.
[Brianboulton]: I thought you'd like to know that I've nominated this at FAC. Thanks mainly to your peer review comments the article is much stronger than it was, for which I am most grateful.
[Brianboulton]: It seems that most of your review work is now images-related, a noble, necssary and usually thankless task. Are you doing general  reviewing at all? The reason I ask is that I have just sent [[Mozart in Italy]] to peer review. It is an article that is crying out for the sort of review you gave a few months ago to its companion-piece [[Mozart family Grand Tour]]. If it is possible for you to find time to look at this, it would be much appreciated (the images probably need checking out, too).
[Brianboulton]: I wonder, have you had a chance yet to see if the Dean\/Knapp book has significant new information?
[Brianboulton]: Many thanks indeed for sending us the Dean and Knapp chapter, which has enabled useful information to be added to the article. A summary of the changes is on the article's talkpage. We are still considering other minor points, but I'd be happy for you to look at the article in the context of your FAC review, and to add any further comment.
[Brianboulton]: |style=\""vertical-align: middle; border-top: 1px solid gray;\"" | To Awadewit, for locating and making available important additional material during your review of [[Agrippina (opera)]], enhancing the article and assisting its promotion to FA. Grateful thanks,
[Brianboulton]: I second that. I was pleased to work on the article at PR, and am delighted to see its deserved promotion.
[Brianboulton]: I'd like to add my congratulations, and also suggest, for your possible GA-fest, ''[[The Historian]]'' and ''[[The Book of Lost Things]]''. Both have inadequate articles at present, both deserve better. But I daresay you have your own ideas.
[Brianboulton]: My daughter recommended these. She is also a fan of Hilary Mantel and Kate Atkinson. Ring any bells?
[Brianboulton]: Is there no limit to your polymath range? Queen of ogg, now, I'm speechless.  Perhaps I can very humbly call on your expertise when I get down next month to my next opera project, Smetana's ''The Bartered Bride''?  (The images will want checking, too!)
[Brianboulton]: In view of the interest you showed in the [[Bedrich Smetana]] article at FAC, you may be interested to know that the ''Bride'' is getting a makeover, too. It's not ready yet, but I'm hopeful of bringing it to peer review next week. Any observations or suggestions would be most welcome.
[Brianboulton]: Update: the article is now at [[WP:Peer Review]]. Comments welcome.
[Brianboulton]: It's now gone to FAC. Thanks for all your help.
[Brianboulton]: Sorry to hear of your problems. I will leave further comments on ''The Historian'' until you're better able to deal with them. Get well quickly.
[Brianboulton]: How is the disc? Would you like the peer review to resume?
[Brianboulton]: Just to let you know, I have to go away tomorrow for a few days,  and will have limited online access, so if my comments are slow in coming, that's the reason. I will e on to it, though.
[Brianboulton]: Could you please clarify on the FAC page for [[Nansen's Fram expedition]] whether there are any further image issues outstanding, or whether in your view all such issues are settled? Thanks,
[Brianboulton]: Now, I owe you an apology. I intended to ask you when [[The Historian]] was coming to FAC. A quick check with the article reveals that it was actually promoted three days ago; somehow, I missed the entire FAC. I can't understand how this occurred - distracted by Poppea, I suppose. Anyway, please accept my apologies and congratulations.
[Brianboulton]: I have revised the opening sentences to meet the objection raised at FAC. Of course, if you don't like what I've done feel free to change it.
[Brianboulton]: I'm back after my short break, and I've nominated Poppea at FAC. I think I've done all I can - but ''every'' article can be made better. You may like to know that while I was in Rome I visited the house where Keats and Shelley lived, and where Keats died. Got to peek at their library, too. Wonderful.
[Brianboulton]: I have responded to your FAC  concerns.
[Brianboulton]: I  am glad to see that you are active again and hope that your  hospitalisation last week was nothing too serious. Also, congratulations  on \""Rambles\"". The above article is currently on peer review, and has  attracted fairly positive comments from several editors. Nevertheless, I  would very much appreciate your giving it a quick check over. I realise  that this will not be a high priority, but I am in no hurry to send it  to FAC and it will be at PR for a few days yet. With a possible new  reign of piety and iron beginning at FAC, I want to make doubly certain  that my nominations are properly prepared! No worries, though, if you  can't manage it.
[Brianboulton]: Much  appreciated. I plan to keep it on PR until Friday or Saturday (5th or  6th). If you can't reach it by then, never mind. Dissertation rules.
[Brianboulton]: I have responded to your concerns. I wonder if you could briefly revist the review, where [[User:Eubulides|Eubulides]] has commented on the copyright status of [[:File:Vilhjalmur Stefansson.jpg]]. I am still using the stand-by image at the moment.
[Brianboulton]: Per your request, this is to let you know that the above is now at FAC. Thank you for your help in getting it there. A couple of points: I will shortly add a small summary table of the published voyage accounts, as you suggested (I'm not 100% convinced it's necessary but it can do no harm). Secondly, re the Stefansson image - does your recent comment on the PR page indicate that you agree that the original LOC image is free to use, or do you still have a reservation? I am keeping to the substitute image until this is resolved.
[Brianboulton]: I've been working on Monteverdi's ''[[Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria]]'', a sister-article to the recent [[L'incoronazione di Poppea|Poppea]]. It's now at peer review, awaiting judgement. If you have time, please look it over; any comments or suggestions will be very welcome. And you can listen to Panelope's lament as you read through! I've just seen, higher up this page, that you are crazily busy at the moment, so there's no hurry for this; it will be at PR a while.
[Brianboulton]: Hi, Andy. In the past you have been quite active in editing the Mahler Eighth article - did you create it? You haven't been involved with it for a while, but I thought I'd let you know that, in view of the approaching centenary of the work's first performance (12 September) I'm proposing to develop the article, hopefully to featured standard. Work won't begin for a while (I'm embroiled in the Mahler biography at the moment) but you may be interested in developments on your former project, when these begin.
[Brianboulton]: Thanks for your reply. I'm going to put the Mahler biog up for FAC this week; once that it settled one way or the other, I'll be able to devote my time to the Eighth. I have quite a bit of material, including de La Grange's detailed analysis, Cooke, Mitchell etc. De La Grange is also very good on background details. I have two recordings - Bernstein's ancient 1966 version, and Abbado's from 1994 - is there a more up-to-date one that you would recommend? As an adjunct to the article I am preparing a complete discography; there have been more than 60 recordings all told! I will keep in touch.
[Brianboulton]: Do you know whose translation of the text is included in the article, and what the copyright status of that translation is?
[Brianboulton]: I have a issue with possible copyright infringement - it will be very hard, not to mention time-consuming, to demonstrate the right to include these texts in full. However, my main concern is about whether it is necessary to have this text. The article is going to expand considerably over the next couple of weeks, and the text represents a massive amount of kb which could be better employed. The text is almost opera libretto length, and I don't know of any opera article that includes the libretto plus English translation. Is anyone likely to read through it? I think that, rather than include a text of dodgy provenance and possible copyright complications, appropriate quotations from one of the standard translations should be used. It may be possible to have an external link to an online copy of the text.
[Brianboulton]: (PS) You say, above, you have a recording of the Eighth by Zubin Mehta. I can't find out anything about this recording - a complete google blank, in fact. Were you inadvertently reading the conductor's name from an adjoining label? (Mehta recorded a great Second).
[Brianboulton]: Your thoughts and minor corrections and additions are welcome. The draft of the revised article is now complete and I will shortly send it for a general peer review. Please feel free to comment there.
[Brianboulton]: Nice pic, thanks!
[Brianboulton]: Despite your semi-retirement your talk page remains as busy as ever, so I hesitate to add a request, but...the above is a tentative break by me into new territory, a very slender piece of Evelyn Waugh marginalia. I would value a brief comment, even if it's only \""stick to what you know\"" (ice and music). Talkpage or peer review, it matters not; I would be most grateful.
[Brianboulton]: ...in [[Talbot Baines Reed|this]], my exhumation of a Victorian children's writer who was really quite big in his day. My grandfather won one of his books as a Sunday School prize in 1903 \u2013 and I have it! No need to comment, just read it at your leisure, such as you have. Good luck with the jobs market (it ain't lookin' too good over here). Good wishes,
[Brianboulton]: I have decided to take up your suggestion and try to get this article improved and through the system so that it can be TFA on 24th February, to honour the tercentanry of its premiere in London. I have a fair amount of material on the opera itself; what I am most lacking is information relating to recent performances. I have  numerous dates  since 1973, but almost no review information. If you can locate anything relevant, or can suggest where I might search, that would be very helpful. I am dropping a line to [[User:Voceditenore]] who is pretty good at ferretting things out. Please let me know if you have any suggestions.
[Brianboulton]: Great work with the images. I may remove some of these temporarily, while I assemble the revised text and then make decisions about placement and sizing, so don't be alarmed if some of the pics disappear for a while. Suggestions for any additional images can be listed on the article's talkpage.
[Brianboulton]: You mentioned during the discussion on the FAC talkpage that you can log in to ODNB articles simply by entering your library card number. Is this because you are a registered user? I have to go to the library to use my card no. - at home, it is unrecognised. Can you explain exactly what you do? It would be most useful to reach the ODNB (and Grove Music Online, perhaps) from home. Thanks.
[Brianboulton]: I've been to my local libary (Lincolnshire). There is a slight trick which they've shown me, and now from home I can access ODNB, Oxford Music Online, Who's Who and much else besides! So whoopee, and lets hope that this is a service that survives the cuts.
[Brianboulton]: When you can spare a moment, you might like to check over [[Nixon in China (opera)|Nixon in China]], which is now at peer review. Any comments and suggestions would be most welcome.
[Brianboulton]: Enjoy your vacation! When you're back, perhaps you'd take a look at [[Wikipedia:Peer review\/Nixon in China (opera)\/archive1]], where any comments would be most welcome.
[Brianboulton]: Thanks for your help at the peer review. The review has now closed; you may be interested to know that the article has now been nominated at WP:FAC.
[Brianboulton]: Yeah, riley, you shut yer trap.
[Brianboulton]: Thanks for your contributions to the peer review. You may like to know that the article has now been nominated at FAC.
[Brianboulton]: Me too; Sir Tom in his rightful place ([[Nixon in China (opera)|Nixon in China]] went up too). For the future: I am currently working on [[Percy Grainger]] \u2013 though not much visible yet \u2013 and I'm then going to do [[Kathleen Ferrier]], for whom I have acquired much source material. That probably takes me to mid\/late June, which may be an appropriate date for starting the ''Messiah'' project. Are you still up for this, and does that sound like a feasible timescale? I can always adjust as necessary.
[Brianboulton]: It's a bit early, but maybe we should agree a general strategy for approaching this expansion. What parts of the article would you like to work on? I am easy about this, but once I know what I'm going to do, I can begin to collect source materials. I'm bogged down with Grainger at the moment, but will perhaps have something reviewable in about a week. Then I want to do [[Kathleen Ferrier]]; I need to do a \""nice\"" person, after my recent preoccupations with Delius (syphilis), Tom Driberg (sexual predator) Nixon (all-round bad egg) and Grainger (flagellant racist with syphilitic father). Of course I'll probably find that Kathleen was a crack cocaine addict who practised baby-farming. We shall see. Anyway, hopefully ''Messiah'' can begin in earnest by mid-June. Let me know if you see any problems with that timescale.
[Brianboulton]: I've looked over the JSTOR and press articles; there's some pretty good stuff there, for which many thanks. You can view the full list of assembled sources [[User:Brianboulton\/Sandbox7|here]]; it looks impressive. I hope to be at work on this next wek, when Grainger is safely in peer review.
[Brianboulton]: At last I have sent Percy to peer review, though I'm still tweaking and polishing. It really does need someone uninvolved to look it over, as I have been pretty well the only active editor in the month since I began working on it. I'd be very obliged if you could comment \u2013 don't forget to listen to the sound file, and to the couple of soundlinks in the External links section (Percy's rapid-fire performance of \""Country Gardens\"" is a particular delight). I'll be happy to return the review favour whenever necessary.
[Brianboulton]: I'm a little clearer on my timetable now. I've just sent my current biographical project, [[Percy Grainger]], to peer review. If things go OK there, it might be at FAC by around 22 May and perhaps through by early  June. Next week I am starting on my next project, [[Kathleen Ferrier]] which I hope will be finished by early July. Then, until about mid-August,  I will be working on the ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' with [[User:Tim riley|Tim riley]]. So I'll be ready for serious work on Amundsen by around the middle of August \u2013 that should leave plenty of time to get the article up to FA standard, and promoted  to be TFA on the Great Day. Incidentally, I can't understand why [[Air-tractor sledge]] isn't getting more FAC attention; it's an excellent article, and I'm hoping that the critical third support will arrive soon.
[Brianboulton]: Have you seen pp. 16-17 of today's ''Guardian'' review section? An article by [[Harry Christophers]] on tonight's \""Supersize\"" ''Messiah'' at the RFH. Come to think of it, you're probably there in the audience, right now. But the article is worth hanging on to (performance history and all that).
[Brianboulton]: I've decided to send Percy to FAC, as the PR seems to be complete now. Thanks again for your comments.
[Brianboulton]: Among the stuff you sent was a Sunday Times review by Humphrey Burton, dated 24.4.88, of Leonard's Ferrier biography. Burton's piece contains a passage I'd like to quote. Do you have a page number for the review? As there is no online link, FAC reviewers will require a page reference.
[Brianboulton]: Yes, great work. But no mention of Grainger? Dearie, dearie me!
[Brianboulton]: Thanks! I was not actually fishing for compliments re Percy; I was teasing Tim for not mentioning PG in his impressive expansion of the Nellie article (there is no real reason why he should, of course, but they did meet and even worked together briefly). I'm not really surprised that the Australian music portal has little on Grainger, since he hardly lived there and wrote very little characteristically Australian music. Grainger doesn't neatly fit into portals, being more or less unclassifiable.
[Brianboulton]: NB Edith Sitwell is on my \""to do\"" list, possibly early next year if I last that long.
[Brianboulton]: I have opened a workpage, [[User:Brianboulton\/Sandbox3|here]], for noting down useful sources etc. Please fel free to add anything that looks useful. Do you have the JSTORs as listed?
[Brianboulton]: Do your multifarious sources have any information on Phyllis Spurr, the pianist who accompanied Kathleen Ferrier at many of her recitals and recordings in the late 1940s and early 1950s? Unlike Gerald Moore, Phyllis seemingly shunned publicity; I can't find any references to her on the internet apart from her appearances in lists of performers. Nor can I find that she ever worked with anyone else but Ferrier; after the latter's death, Spurr seems to disappear completely from the concert and recording scene. If  any of your watchers have any useful information, perhaps they would note it on my talkpage. If enough can be gleaned I will do a short article.
[Brianboulton]: Belated congratulations on this article's promotion to FA, well deserved. By the way, I have opened a workpage [[User:Brianboulton\/Sandbox4|here]], to list sources and other material that might be useful for the Amundsen's expedition article later this summer. Please add to it anything that you think might be helpful.
[Brianboulton]: I've checked out the Spurr material you unearthed. Probably not enough info for more than a brief stub, but I'll consider it. Thanks for your help.
[Brianboulton]: I have sent Ferrier to PR. It has been a surprisingly difficult article to write; I'd be grateful for any comments or suggestions for improvement. By the way, which is you in that photograph further up your talkpage?
[Brianboulton]: If you can spare the time in the next 10 days or so, I'd be very grateful if you could read through [[Kathleen Ferrier]] at peer review. I know it's not in your usual ambit, but a wide spectrum of viewpoints can often be more illuminating than the comments of experts. If impossible, no problems.
[Brianboulton]: Well smug old fart or not, my wife thinks you're a bit of a dish (reminiscent of a slightly younger Colin Davis). Looking forward to your Ferrier comments; by the way, I've not been able to find a source which confirms the \""terrier\"" pronunciation so I've left this alone.
[Brianboulton]: On ''Messiah'', would you look at [[User:Brianboulton\/Sandbox3|Messiah workpage]] where I have posted ideas about the article's structure and a possible division of labour.
[Brianboulton]: I have put a construction banner on the article and am posting stuff there.
[Brianboulton]: I have left some notes\/suggestions on the [[User:Brianboulton\/Sandbox3|the ''Messiah'' workpage]].
[Brianboulton]: Alert! Ref 45 (gfhandel.org) - link not working at present.
[Brianboulton]: ...and a couple more problems to turn the air blue: Ref 53 JSTOR link ain't working. Ref 62: I think you need to attribute your quote from \""The Harmonicon\"" in the text (and say what it is - magazine, broadsheet or whatever), otherwise the reader will have no idea where it's coming from. I'll format the ref when you've done this. I must say I'm impressed with the scope and depth of your research; makes mine seem rather limited.
[Brianboulton]: 14 and 28 were my blunders, put right now. While I'm waiting for some more sources to help me with the music section (old Percy Young c. 1951 is surprisingly good, btw), I shall mainly be working in a sandbox on the subarticle list of movements (and attending to some reviewing duties ''and'' getting Ferrier ready for FAC if I can find the time). Thanks for the list of editions - looks like another subarticle in the making but we can decide later on that.
[Brianboulton]: Keeping you fully informed: Ferrier is now at FAC. Progress on my current project (joint with [[User:Tim riley|Tim riley]]), ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'', has been good; I would expect this to be at PR in early July.  So I should be able to start some serious Amundsen work a little earlier than I had anticipated.
[Brianboulton]: While working on the subarticle I have investigated the wikisource link in the \""Texts and structure\"" section of the existing article. This is an Alladdin's cave of soundfiles, and includes the entire text. With this resource we don't need a subarticle for the list of movements. But I am not sure  that wikisource pages can be linked within an article in this way; I have always thought of them as external links. I am seeking advice from the ever-wise and all-knowing Ruhrfisch on this point, and also on the copyright status of the soundfiles. In the meantime I will suspend work on the subarticle. In any event I have a number of commitments this weekend which will affect the amount of work I can do on the article. Look out on my talkpage (or his) for Ruhrfisch's reply.
[Brianboulton]: When you have a moment, could you visit the Messiah sandbox and comment on my latest thoughts on subarticles etc?
[Brianboulton]: Time for another check! I've left a progress report in the sandbox.
[Brianboulton]: Please can you check in on the work page? The article is pretty well stalled at present and urgently needs your input.
[Brianboulton]: I gather from the above that Levin has become a GA, so well done on that.
[Brianboulton]: I agree with that.
[Brianboulton]: I've done a ce job on the section & reduced it by 100 words. Don't think I've left out anything important; if I have, by all means put it back.
[Brianboulton]: I'm back from a 48-hour break. To me, ''Messiah'' looks ready for assessment by other eyes, so if it's OK with you I'll put it up for peer review tomorrow (Tuesday). I will ask Jappalang to look at all the images and soundfiles, and I'll also ask Ruhrfisch for a review since it was his suggestion that led me to start work on the article in the first place. When it's up, perhaps you would alert some of the gang who like your articles, so as to get the widest range of comments that we can.
[Brianboulton]: I've been working with colleagues on this important article for some time. It has a large number of images and soundfiles, all of which need vetting. If you can find time to look these over, we'd be very grateful.
[Brianboulton]: As we have lost the soundfile from Part III (see PR), and as it seems possible that there are no PD soundfiles for this Part, I have restored your \""Worthy is the Lamb\"" manuscript illustration. Can you check out the source information on the image file? If this is incorrect, can you include full publication details of the source you scanned it from?
[Brianboulton]: No, the only such tool I know of is the \""Reviewer summary\"" in the toolbox on the FAC page, which lists the usernames of all contributors to the current FAC page - does that help you?
[Brianboulton]: Doesn't your toolbox on the left of the FAC page include \""Reviewer summary\"", listed between \""Special pages\"" and \""Page size\""? I thought this toolbox was a standard feature on every page, but perhaps it is only available with certain browsers. I use Mozilla Firefox.
[Brianboulton]: Well, perhaps one of the admins who watches this page will pick up on this and explain why I have it and you don't.
[Brianboulton]: FYI: I have started a revised and extended Background section for the Amundsen expedition article (the present section is rubbish). Working in sandboxes, will post soon.
[Brianboulton]: I'm away from home for a couple of days but I'll try and catch up with my chores (including Waddington) when I get back.
[Brianboulton]: I will certainly look at [[Far Eastern Party]] and comment as appropriate. It may be tomorrow rather than today because I am backlogged after a couple of days' absence. Sorry I missed your Amundsen note; I have now responded.
[Brianboulton]: Per your peer review comments on the soundfiles, I've removed those for which you queried the licence. A couple of new  pics have been added to the article since you commented; these are [[:File:BLW Handel.jpg]] (replacing the earlier drawing of the Handel statue) and [[:File:Worthy-is-the-lamb.jpg]] replacing \""The trumpets shall sound\"" soundfile. Would you mind confirming that these images are free of problems? Thanks,
[Brianboulton]: Per my note on your talkpage, I emailed you on 19 July, but it clearly went somewhere else. I have tried again, just now: any luck?
[Brianboulton]: I'm pleased to say that the PDFs have arrrived, courtesy of the Finetooth express. My thanks to you both.
[Brianboulton]: If it's OK with you, I'll nominate on Wednesday. There probably won't be many comments to field before your return on Thursday> I'll ask Gerda if she wants to be a conom.
[Brianboulton]: Can-can do, though it may be a wee-wee while.
[Brianboulton]: Although most of your efforts have been directed to subarticles I feel that your contribution to the improvement of the main article, whether as consultant or editor,  has been significant. Adding your name to the FA nominators recognises this; it imposes no special obligation on you, and I think it is justified.
[Brianboulton]: Gerda, you are part of the team and that is that. I  have just made the nomination; I am off-wiki until late on Thursday (in London erecting a bed for my daughter, believe it or not) so I won't be able to field the early comments, but I don't expect there'll be many. I am letting the main peer-reviewers know about the nomination, but feel free to spread the word; an active nom is always a good thing.
[Brianboulton]: Yes, there are many such quotes, but we have to keep the article's detail within limits. I have made the FAC nom now, so no further changes for the moment.
[Brianboulton]: For your general information, [[Messiah (Handel)]] is now at FAC (no doubt to be joined soon by [[Richard Nixon|Tricky Dick]]).
[Brianboulton]: I'm very pleased to hear this; you worked extremely hard on this article and the promotion was fully deserved. Perhaps another waterway article beckons? I used to cruise a lot on the Oxford Canal - happy days!
[Brianboulton]: In the event, \""I don't expect there'll be many\"" was a bit off the mark, and a highly active first 24 hours has brought us six supports, some useful comments, and some minor disagreement. So all looks healthy thus far. Tim, will you be fielding Nikki's remaining source queries? We don't want to duplicate our efforts.
[Brianboulton]: Well, I don't have a lot of time right now. As I recall, my chief objections concerned the plot section, which I thought was incomprehensible to the general reader. A quick look indicates some improvement, at least in the first paragraph, but I still get lost a little further on. What does \""Decker revokes all of Chuck's CIA resources\"" mean to the uninitiated, i.e. me? How come a transport is carrying Alexei when in the previous paragraph he was in prison? Can you be clearer about the sudden appearance of \""Hartley Winterbottom\""? And so on...And you are continuing to identify characters with actors, which has nothing to do with the plot and as I said before, adds to the difficulties. I think your main problem is that this is a pretty convoluted and fast-moving plot, much of it based on events earlier in the series of which of course I and many others are ignorant. So it is very difficult for you to write something that is going to be generally understood. One possible solution would be to write a much briefer outline plot, leaving out much of the confusing detail. I'd say quite a bit more work is necessary before he article is ready for another try at FAC, and I suggest that before you renominate it, you send it to [[WP:Peer review|peer review]].
[Brianboulton]: I wasn't in the least offended, just amused. I didn't want the delegates to think I hadn't reviewed the article properly before supporting, which is why I raised the issue.
[Brianboulton]: I have safely brought ''Fram'' to the Bay of Whales. In due course I expect to be able to trim by a few hundred words (this is usually possible, I find). However, for the next week or so my main  attention will be elsewhere. I have standarised the Amundsen ''South Pole'' references to, e.g. \""Amundsen (Vol. I), p. 45\"" rather than \""Amundsen (1976), p. 45\"". It is a two-volume work and pagination starts again from 1 in Vol. II. A certain amount of textual harmonisation may be necessary, to ensure that we neither duplicate nor give differing accounts of the same thing.
[Brianboulton]: Tim, do you still have JSTOR access? If so, is there any chance you could recover [http:\/\/www.jstor.org\/pss\/1343890|this] and let me have it? I would be most grateful
[Brianboulton]: Sorry, I mistyped the url. [http:\/\/www.jstor.org\/pss\/1343890 This] should give you what you need. In case you're worried I am not adding to my private porn collection.
[Brianboulton]: Many thanks. Not pretty stuff, but all will be clear in a week or so.
[Brianboulton]: PR needs all the help it can get at the moment, so it's good if you can do the odd one or two. I often solicit reviews from editors who I think might be interested in and\/or knowledgeable about a particular subject. In fact, it so happens that I have ''you'' in mind for something I am cooking up...All will be revealed next week!
[Brianboulton]: Yes. I intend to spend some time there myself, but my activities are somewhat restricted at the moment. But I honestly don't think you will need to worry about Nixon.
[Brianboulton]: Not especially, though I can be seduced by anything that reads well (except wrestling and US TV series). I imagine that you have relatively broad tastes, too - we shall see.
[Brianboulton]: ...not to mention the great efforts of you and  other editors over the past few months. However, enough of the compliments while I bare my reviewer's teeth.
[Brianboulton]: Thanks to you both for your help and good wishes. It ''was'' tough, in the sense that the piece is so well-known that  everything had to check out. I'm pretty happy with how the article has worked out: all credit to Tim and Gerda, too. Team effort.
[Brianboulton]: Yes indeed: your help, particularly in the early stages of the writing, was much appreciated. I hope you enjoy seeing ''Rinaldo''; I've never seen it myself, but I love the music and enjoyed writing the article earlier this year.
[Brianboulton]: One for the team. Thanks for your contribution.
[Brianboulton]: I have done so."

John Riemann Soong,False,"[John Riemann Soong]: AFAIK the lower step is one of the many decomposition pathways that LSD will undergo if exposed to even moderately acidic conditions. Under acidic conditions the activated alkene will change to a more stable (more conjugated) product.
[John Riemann Soong]: I should actually remove some of the equilibrium arrows, but the bottom reaction refers to less-than-reversible decomposition, like why LSD is so sensitive to what most would consider mild conditions. AFAIK it's not OR -- it's a common sense pathway probably actually leading to a spread of products which can easily be found.
[John Riemann Soong]: It's an extended enamine -- hardly a speculation. I'm actually supposed to search for something else (like a sugar to modify gold nanorods with) this afternoon. Btw, it reaches enol form via deprotonation and reprotonation. Whether it changes into the other enantiomer via an enol or an enolate is a minor issue. It probably does both depending on the pH.
[John Riemann Soong]: There is some serious angle strain in this molecule. Also if it wouldn't probably spontaneously explode upon distillation, I wonder if it is a little volatile, like [[Titanium tetrachloride]]. Anyway, this is on top of a peroxy motif attached to Cr(VI). O-O bonds are usually long, but from that ball and stick image it seems to me like complexed dioxygen?
[John Riemann Soong]: Why removed published material? It's not OR.
[John Riemann Soong]: Well it's not really at all the same topic. That article deals with gold in a +1 or +3 oxidation state -- ''not at all the same chemistry''. Stubs have to start ''somewhere''. I was invariably planning on improving it when I wasn't so busy. Can you please offer a real reason for merging an article about a near-covalent bond to an article dealing with ionic compounds?"

RL0919,True,"[RL0919]: I saw that you removed several categories from the [[Ayn Rand]] article that related to her being Jewish (and in one case both Russian-American and Jewish). Your edit summary said \""Heritage categories should not be used to record people based on deduction, inference, residence, surname, nor any partial derivation from one or more ancestors)\"". However, that Rand was Jewish and from Russia is attested to in multiple reliable sources. Therefore I have reverted your edit. If you think these categories do not apply for some less obvious reason, I would ask that you discuss it on the [[Talk:Ayn Rand| talk]] page prior to any further removals. Thanks. --
[RL0919]: Now that the relevant edit is a settled matter as far as I am concerned, let me say for the record that your accusations of racism are based on uncharitable assumptions about other people's motives, and a looseness with facts. I never talked about Rand's grandparents or \""one drop\"" or anything of the sort, and you are the one making unfounded claims about her parents. You could have discussed your edits and the policy reasoning behind them without any reference to motives or speculation about facts you did not have. The result would have been the same. You chose instead to use inflammatory terms and make accusations about motives. This choice on your part says something significant about your character -- and not to put too fine a point on it, it says something negative. --

[RL0919]: As someone with no preference either way (I came across this when I noticed what seemed like a potential edit war on the the guideline page), I'm afraid I agree with others who are concerned about this close. \""No consensus\"" appears to be a more appropriate evaluation of the discussion. I hope you will consider modifying your close based on this feedback. With a \""no consensus\"" close, I believe the language of the section should be restored to the wording from [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:User_pages&oldid=429454811#Removal_of_comments.2C_notices.2C_and_warnings this version] that preceded the changes that led to the RfC and does does not specifically mention removal of block notices one way or the other. (Note: I will be making a similar comment to the discussions on the [[Wikipedia talk:User pages#Removal of current block notices|guideline talk page]] and at the the [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard#Should users be allowed to remove current block notices? and Require all new articles to contain at least one source|Administrators' noticeboard]].) --

[RL0919]: No problem. Probably a clicking accident. I've done it before myself. --
[RL0919]: That's not something for me to unilaterally decide, and I have no authorization to go on a deletion spree through his user space. You can nominate one or more of the pages for deletion at [[WP:MFD]], and if the consensus favors deletion (which has been the case for his pages recently), I'm happy to help with closing the discussions and deleting the pages. I was also going to refer you to [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment\/Drnhawkins]], but I see you already know about that. --
[RL0919]: I think I still like the welcome-anon template better, but thanks for the effort to forge a consensus for how to handle this. --
[RL0919]: All that said, sometimes an initial version of an article is deleted, but later someone writes a new article on the same subject that is kept. So if you think CarsOnTheWeb can meet the criteria for inclusion, you could try again. If you do, I'd strongly suggest a few things: First and foremost, try to support the article with [[WP:RS|independent reliable sources]], such as news coverage about the company (not press releases). Second, focus as much as possible on \""encyclopedic\"" information, such as the history of the company and its significance, rather than talking about its current offerings, so that no one could interpret the material as an attempt to promote the company's services. Finally, I would recommend creating the page as a draft in your own userspace (such as [[User:Jeans be\/CarsOnTheWeb]]) rather than immediately putting it in the article space. Userspace drafts are given more leeway, so you would have a bit of time to work on improving the material. --
[RL0919]: Wanted to make sure you realized that the seven day period for MFDs started on July 28 will be up tomorrow, not today. Looks like everything started on July 27 was already closed due to speedy deletions, leaving a gap for closes needed today. --
[RL0919]: It happens. I once closed an entire day early at [[WP:TFD]] without even the excuse of a gap in the dates. By the way, there is a backlog at TFD, if you are looking for discussions to close. :) --
[RL0919]: I believed there was a consensus in that discussion, else I would not have deleted the templates. Those favoring deletion had cogent reasons for their position and responded to the keep arguments, including yours. The discussion was closed after it had been open for over eight days. If there were just two or three contributors (as happens all too often at TFD, including one I reopened last month after a similar request) and you had missed your chance to contribute, I would be more sympathetic to your request. But there were eight participants, including yourself. I realize that more time might have allowed you to change the previous consensus. That's always a possibility anytime a new comment comes late in the discussion, but I see no reason to think it is any more likely than in dozens of other discussions. So overall I'm inclined to leave this particular discussion closed. --
[RL0919]: That's what I was thinking. The word wasn't used in a direct quote, and I don't think we can assume the reporter knows the details of Wikipedia terminology. Plus the MediaWiki editing interface is widely understood to be a challenge for new editors. --
[RL0919]: Thought about it, slept on it, and I still think the discussion close should stick. You can ask for a [[WP:DRV|deletion review]] if you wish. --
[RL0919]: The article is [[WP:SEMI|semi-protected]], so as an unregistered user, you cannot simply make the change yourself. You must request on the talk page for a registered, [[WP:AUTOCONFIRM|autoconfirmed]] editor to make the change. If the request seems controversial, it won't be made unless other editors on the talk page agree with it. Alternatively, you can [[WP:REGISTER|register]] an account and make a few other edits, and once your account is autoconfirmed,  you could make the change yourself. But be careful; the reason the page is protected is because Sharpton is controversial and a [[WP:BLP|living person]], so it may be wiser to discuss the edits on the talk page even if you do have an account. --"

HairyWombat,False,"[HairyWombat]: In December 2009, you uploaded [[:File:BBC World Service Big Ben 1-1-2009.ogg]]. Two things: First, I have taken a (reduced quality) extract of this for use in an article. The extract is called [[:File:BBC World Service Westminster chimes.ogg]]. Hope that is OK. Second, somebody has placed a {{tl|Non-free reduce}} template on your original file. It looks like they want the quality reduced to less than 64 kbps. If you like, I can do this for you, but I wanted to ask before doing it. (Please respond here as I am watching this page.)
[HairyWombat]: It is not a matter of what I think (I prefer the highest quality), but of what is necessary to avoid your file being deleted by deletionists. What about the extract? Do you object to me taking that? I want it to replace a recording of mine in the article [[Westminster Quarters]]. (My recording has been proposed for deletion.)
[HairyWombat]: Later. The file was deleted anyway, so I have appealed the decision [[Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard\/Incidents#File_deleted_in_error|here]].
[HairyWombat]: Even later. Appeal was successful; file undeleted. Discussion of administator's recent behaviour is taking place [[Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard#User:Melesse|here]].
[HairyWombat]: It is obviously up to you if you respond and how, but you might want to describe the state the articles were in before the template was used.
[HairyWombat]: If you wish to respond, please do so here.
[HairyWombat]: If you visit the link I gave above ([http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Special:WhatLinksHere\/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy  this one]), you will find another 50 or 60. (If breaking that many links is not vandalism then I would like to see what is.) You seem keen to take on this task, so I will leave it in your capable hands. Best of luck. Bye,
[HairyWombat]: On December 10, 2010 you added two {{Tl|Clarify}} tags to the [[OpenAL#Rapture3D OpenAL Driver]] section ([http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=OpenAL&diff=401695494&oldid=395318524 here]). I am familiar with [[Ambisonics]], but it is not clear to me what clarification you feel is needed. Wikipedia contains a long and detailed article on [[Ambisonics]] which is linked to from that section. I don't see what else is needed, or possible in just a few words. Please respond here.
[HairyWombat]: I noticed you have been putting links inside of <nowiki><ref><\/ref><\/nowiki> structures. I must suggest that this is inappropriate. For example, [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Facial_recognition_system&diff=prev&oldid=436834228 this edit], adding <nowiki>\""[[anti-terror system]]s\""<\/nowiki> to a parameter {{Para|title}}, created a second broken (<span style=\""color:red\"">red<\/span>) external link. Less seriously, in the same edit, the addition of <nowiki>\""[[stalking]] women\""<\/nowiki> to a parameter {{Para|quote}} changed the quote into a misquote (because the original text did not include the link). (I have reverted these two changes.) Obviously links outside of <nowiki><ref><\/ref><\/nowiki> structures are a good idea. If you wish to respond, please do so here.
[HairyWombat]: Yobot made [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Michael_Gerzon&curid=8924658&diff=438678625&oldid=432430559 this edit] to the {{Tl|Infobox scientist}} in the article [[Michael Gerzon]]. It deleted the blank parameter {{para|box_width}}. Good edit; the blank parameter should not have been left lying around. However, the Edit summary left by the robot was \""Updated infobox (BRFA 15) per [[Template talk:Infobox person\/birth death params]] using AWB (7782)\"". This Edit summary is both cryptic and misleading. What is \""BRFA 15\""? I cannot find a mention of this anywhere; this is cryptic. Also, the discussion the link refers to makes no mention of a {{para|box_width}} parameter or, indeed, anything to do with widths; this is misleading. Please improve the Edit summaries Yobot deposits. Thank you. (If you wish to respond, please do so here.)
[HairyWombat]: OK, so why not make \""BRFA 15\"" a link to [[User:Yobot#Approved_tasks]]? The link to \""[[Template talk:Infobox person\/birth death params]]\"" is more problematic. What is required is a link to a concensus about these tasks. You seem to be suggesting that there hasn't even been a discussion (other than of birth\/death parameters). I must suggest that you initiate such a discussion somewhere. I stress that I don't have a problem with the edits the bot is performing; there just seems to be a lack of openness.
[HairyWombat]: Also, the parameter {{Para|box_width}} is still in both the doc page and source code of {{Tl|Infobox scientist}}. {{Para|bodystyle}} ''width'', which it uses, is also in the doc page of the meta-template {{Tl|Infobox}}. You say that box_width is not supported, but that does not seem to be the case. As long as it remains in doc pages then people will continue to use it, and your efforts to get rid of it will fail.
[HairyWombat]: The alternative is to seek help. Reading [[Template talk:Infobox person\/birth death params]], there seems to be a group of people interested in this. Why not make your to-do list, but then push that out so that others can take up some of the burden? OK, I am done now. Bye."

I could have done it with [[Operation Tractable]], which went from 3,000 to 31,000 bytes in two days, but I didn't know how the process worked.  I'm completely rewriting the articles on the [[Kongo class battlecruiser]], most of which are quite thin, and will give me an opportunity to get some potential DYKs out there.

Kauffner,False,"[Kauffner]: Thanks for nominating [[Star of Bethlehem]] for feature article status. I did most of the writing and shepherded the article to \""GA\"" status, so I feel it's my baby.
[Kauffner]: It was nice for a while, but now it's looking pretty grim. Redoing all the references would take hours and hours and nobody reading the article would even notice the difference. And they just keep piling on. I have never seen any article that follows all those citeria, featured or not. Maybe they object to everything -- and least some them don't want to feature anything Christian. They don't want us to reference the Bible? What can you say to that?
[Kauffner]: Despite how the FAC is going, I think the article itself is shaping up quite nicely. Thanks for all your hard work. I think the lead should be a bit longer and there should be a \""Further reading\"" section for printed material. We also need to figure what to do all the citations [[User talk:Rbreen|Rbreen]] added. He put in about 20 books cites just to make a few small points. I'm not looking forward to reformating them, but he will not be a happy camper if we delete them. If the citation format is inconstant, that will certain come up in any future review. I've been looking at different feature articles lately to try to a good model follow.  But IMO, we are already a step above most of the current feature articles.
[Kauffner]: Kudos for moving so many Thai royals back to the right place. Can you check out these articles, which are now in [[User:Monarchians|User:Monarchians]]' \""double prince\"" style: [[Prince Rangsit Prayurasakdi, The Prince of Chainat]], [[Prince Nakkhatra Mangkala, The Prince of Chanthaburi II]], [[Prince Chui of Siam, The Prince Boworn Maha Senanurak]] and [[Prince Chitcharoen, The Prince Narisara Nuvadtivongs]]? Perhaps these article names can be spiked to prevent him from moving them back.
[Kauffner]: I think the best citation to look up is ''The Poor Man's Guardian'', \""Advertisements & Notices,\"" Issue 54. June 23, 1832. Text fragment: \u201cattack on the Iron Duke, the\u201d. That could get us new information, as opposed to confirming what I did. This was right after the iron shutters were put up, so it might tell us if people at the time made a connection with the nickname. The ''Freeman Journal'' cites are 14 June 1830, 16 June 16 1830, 28 June 1830, 26 July 1830, 30 October 1830, 5 November 1830, 4 January 1832, and 18 May 1832. I am surprised you haven\u2019t voted in the [[Talk:Duke_of_Marlborough#Requested_move_to_.22Duke_of_Marlborough_.28title.29.22|Duke of Marlborough]] page move yet.
[Kauffner]: If you looked at [[Talk:Ngo Bao Chau]], then you know it was a central discussion designed to set a precedent. What sense would it make to have each article done a different way? There was a similar recent discussion at [[Talk:Dang Huu Phuc]], which also resulted in Vietnamese diacritics being stripped out of the article title. You can't use any recent community decision as a basis to put these diacritics in. Voting is split down the middle for [[WP:Naming conventions (use English)\/Diacritics RfC]]. This RFC would officially adopt Slavic, Scandinavian, and other diacritic systems, but not Vietnamese. So we have to assume that Vietnamese diacritics have less support. I leave the diacritics in the article themselves, including boldfaced and in the opening. The purpose of titles is to make it easy to find the articles and easy to link to them. So they should be the typeable, common use version of the name, equivalent to a book title. Book titles are almost always given without special characters, and certainly without Vietnamese diacritics.
[Kauffner]: I suppose you can do that if you like. I thought that there might be some reason why you are doing what you are doing, but apparently not.

[Razorflame]: Hi.  I'm fairly new to the English Wikipedia (I joined here last November, but haven't edited here much) and I was wondering if you would be willing to help me get the hang of the English Wikipedia and also tell me what I should do in order to have a successful RfA here.  Please let me know by responding to this message on my talk page, as this place is much to busy for me to keep tabs on this message.  Thanks,
[Razorflame]: I responded to your message at my talk page.  Cheers,
[Razorflame]: Thank you for reviewing my request!  I hope to not let you down now that you've given me the rollback function!  Cheers,
[Razorflame]: Just a question, but what are the warnings for vandalism and removing content here?  I am somewhat new to this Wikipedia, but I am a veteran of the Simple English Wikipedia, so I know how to warn someone, it's just that I don't know the warnings here.  Please respond on my talk page.  Thanks,
[Razorflame]: Hi there.  Thanks for the question that you asked me on my administrator coaching page.  I have replied to the comment that you left on that page.  Cheers,
[Razorflame]: I also do not believe that having a specific number of edits is beneficial.  I have actually disregarded that information mostly because it was outside of my comfort area (although I was serious about writing articles).  I won't actually create 1 article a day, but I will create at least 1 article every couple of days because I really like creating articles.  I wanted a general idea as to when someone thought that I should have an RfA, no more, no less.  Cheers,
[Razorflame]: Hi there.  I just saw your message that you left Balloonman, and I would just like to point out a major mistake that you wrote.  Though I did say that I would never try there again, that was actually not the case.  The reason why I said this was because I was hoping people would pick up on the other meaning that I was trying to get at, which was that I would wait for someone to nominate me for adminship over there.  I did not come over here to try to get adminship just because I failed 6 RfA's.  Actually, I came over here because I saw a lot of vandalism that I could revert and I wanted to help out.  It just happened to become so much more than that.  Cheers,
[Razorflame]: Please read [http:\/\/simple.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia:Simple_talk\/Archive_32#.22I_am_withdrawing_from_this_RfA._I_will_not_try_again.22_--_Razorflame. this].  Cheers,
[Razorflame]: My current admin target established by my admin coach and me is September of this year, because I've already gotten 2 months of activity here.  Over there, there is no set time.  I am simply waiting for someone from a very special list of users to nominate me (Lights, Gwib, Tygrrr, Creol, EchoBravo, Eptalon, Vector, or Cometstyles).  Cheers,
[Razorflame]: The most likely outcome will be that I probably won't become an administrator over on the Simple English Wikipedia until after September, so I should be fine.  Cheers,
[Razorflame]: Hi there.  It is sad to see you gone from Simple Wikipedia, but why don't you try the Simple Wiktionary?  You might find it much less drama-filled than the Simple Wikipedia.  Anyways, good luck in your future endeavours, and cheers,

AnonEMouse,True,"[AnonEMouse]: 
[AnonEMouse]: Thanks, but I still don't see where it forbids modification, it just doesn't mention it. If we had to choose, since it specifically says \""reproduction\"", not just \""distribution\"", I would think it would allow modification, since most reproductions do inevitably modify the product and incorporate it in another context. Does such a license need to ''explicitly'' allow modification?
[AnonEMouse]: --
[AnonEMouse]: Hi, you voted to delete [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\/Rex King-Clark]]. I rewrote the article rather completely, and wonder if you could take a new look and see if that changed your mind.
[AnonEMouse]: (what Hans van Themsche did is totally unrelated to this person's article) ... highly debatable. A few hundred news articles relate the two. If she were notable due to being a watercolor painter, or archaeologist, or children's book writer, or computer programmer, yes, we could just mention Hans in a one-sentence trivia section. Instead, she is notable as being a politician for an party rather famous for advocating anti-immigrant policies, and her nephew apparently shot people for being immigrants. And even if you still don't agree that's related, a lot of journalists clearly think it's related; I think we need to at least mention that they think so.
[AnonEMouse]: What can we do for a compromise? Most links to relatives at least mention why the relative is notable on their own, as in not just \""Joe Bloggs is the cousin of Fred Bloggs\"", but \""Joe Bloggs is the cousin of award-winning contortionist tuba player Fred Bloggs\"". Can you write a couple of adjectives in  to accurately describe Hans's notability that would be less of a smear effort against Frieda?
[AnonEMouse]: I beg to disagree. As [[User:Bottesini]] aptly pointed out on [[Talk:Stephanie_Adams#user:65.184.17.216]], Jimbo Wales did not mean for the article to always be three sentences long, he merely meant for it to be rebuilt with extreme care, especially towards citing verifiable sources. I again refer to his edit comment, [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Stephanie_Adams&diff=51550785&oldid=51471934  please rebuild with very careful attention to verifiable sources ONLY]. The books are listed with ISBNs, which provide links to libraries and booksellers, including, but not limited to, [[Amazon.com]] and [[Barnes and Noble]]. Those are highly verifiable sources. The books may not be notable in themselves, in the sense that they don't deserve individual articles, but listing them in their author's article is certainly appropriate.
[AnonEMouse]: You seem to have deleted the footnotes from [[Suzen Johnson]] - why, may I ask?
[AnonEMouse]: I had hoped as much. To err is human...
[AnonEMouse]: !!! Splutter, choke, cough. LOL.
[AnonEMouse]: There's a blow to my self esteem! :-)
[AnonEMouse]: You wrote that you might change your deletion opinion if I added my sourced claims to the article. I have done so.
[AnonEMouse]: Now for most biographies, I agree, that the fact that someone has had breast implants could be a controversial or even defamatory issue that should requires detailed reliable citation. However for Wendy Whoppers that's a bit like needing a citation for the sky being blue. :-) Even if they weren't her main claim to fame, more to the point, you will notice that the very next paragraph is dedicated to historical and technical details about the breast implants, and it is cited from two different sources. I propose that those citations should more than suffice for that one as well.
[AnonEMouse]: Thank you!
[AnonEMouse]: All right, all right. I wanted to write a big long response, but if the public demands... :-)
[AnonEMouse]: But I want to be honest! I want to tell everything! I'll try very hard to shut up now. I think I see the fascination, and why you were so nervous during your second. <small>Twitch, twitch.<\/small>
[AnonEMouse]: No thanks! Frankly, while I respect Tony's energy and dedication, I actually disagree with the way he went about some things, he was pretty rough on people some times. So not only can I not replace him, I'm not sure I want to.
[AnonEMouse]: Wait, I got ... an oppose? I must commit seppuku immediately...
[AnonEMouse]: Hrr. I read it, and not responding is harder than I thought it would be. It's not a silly diatribe, it's an intelligent, detailed, and reasonably respectful and well thought out objection. I won't change the user's mind, but I do think it does deserve a response, just out of courtesy. Maybe on the talk page? I'll give you two a chance to convince me otherwise...
[AnonEMouse]: Thanks, I provided extensive links and discussion on that page, [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship\/AnonEMouse]].
[AnonEMouse]: Done, but I fear Doc Tropic is going to try hunt me down and explain that the word \""brief\"" [http:\/\/en.wikiquote.org\/wiki\/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29 does not mean what I think it means]...
[AnonEMouse]: Congratulations on the DYK! I made ... just a few short comments ... on [[Wikipedia:Peer review\/Mom and Dad\/archive1]]. :-)
[AnonEMouse]: Thank you all. I'm a bit overwhelmed, and will try to start slowly.
[AnonEMouse]: Responded in both places, though I somehow believe in not quite the way you wanted.
[AnonEMouse]: I would think that being president of a major university, graduates of which became governors and ministers would be at least an assertion of notability. Might lose an AfD, but should at least get one.
[AnonEMouse]: Sorry, I don't \""chat\"" much.
[AnonEMouse]: It's all right, it's not supposed to be private or anything. I just didn't advertise.
[AnonEMouse]: But you'll see I did remember to check my email, though! That's something... :-)
[AnonEMouse]: Thank you for your courtesy. Good luck with the article.
[AnonEMouse]: 
[AnonEMouse]: In [[Singing telegram]], you wikilinked [[George P. Oslin]]. Did you plan to make that article? When I wrote that part of the singing telegram, I looked around a bit for information on Oslin, and only found singing telegram stuff. Is he notable for other things as well?
[AnonEMouse]: All right, good luck!
[AnonEMouse]: Thank you, I understand, but reserve the right to disagree. <small>Not about misspelling, of course, that is certainly minor.<\/small>
[AnonEMouse]: Oh, lordy. It is rather poor quality. You're talking about [[Template:Porn-stub]] I gather? The issue has been brought up on the talk page there for a while. I guess the idea is that there isn't much better choice. Can you meet me there?
[AnonEMouse]: Delete. Nothing encyclopedic.
[AnonEMouse]: Sorry, I don't now enough about Lebanese people to tell which additions are irrelevant. But his edits clearly aren't [[Wikipedia:Vandalism]], see that link. \""Any good-faith effort to improve the encyclopedia, even if misguided or ill-considered, is not vandalism. Apparent bad-faith edits that do not make their bad-faith nature inarguably explicit are not considered vandalism at Wikipedia.\"" It's a content dispute, and apparently a minor one - will the addition of one or two debatable entries to this list really shake the world? Discuss it on the article's talk page, and try to come to agreement or compromise.
[AnonEMouse]: Weighed in, and have to tell you, it was a close thing. I looked at most of the references and they were passing mentions at best. If not for Uncle G's emphasis of the St. Louis business article, I would have argued to endorse the deletion. Try to rewrite from a neutral point of view, not as an ad.
[AnonEMouse]: No, sorry. It's not being used to discredit her, it's an important part of her biography, and a notable part of her fame. Few articles about [[Alessandra Mussolini]] won't mention her past as a Playboy model, and she does not hide it in her interviews.
[AnonEMouse]: By the way, being an indefinitely blocked user is often considered reason for being blocked again. Even though I've been given [[Wikipedia:Administrator|the mop and flamethrower]] since we last met, I won't do it myself (since an admin shouldn't block someone in an edit dispute with them, and also since I do think you do have good intentions), however I should warn you to be careful. I've looked over your edits, and they're not vandalism, but they're mostly on talk pages, and most of the messages on talk pages are rather argumentative. Don't do that. Wikipedia is not a message board, it's an encyclopedia. There are dozens of other places and message boards that you can argue Serbs vs Croats vs Muslims and Fascists vs Communists vs Democrats to your heart's content. Not here, please.
[AnonEMouse]: Userfied to [[User:HeartThrobs\/ImageTalkRebeccaCummings.jpg]].
[AnonEMouse]: You should be aware of this, as you have now deleted it twice from your talk page. The {{tl|blp1}} template is a standard [[Wikipedia:Template messages\/User talk namespace|user talk page warning template]], used in [[Special:Whatlinkshere\/Template:Blp1|dozens of places]] all over the Wikipedia, and is not intended to be an accusation of libel or a personal attack. Your response was extremely personal and offensive.
[AnonEMouse]: We are not a court. We are an encyclopedia. I would be extremely happy to add a clearly useful and important piece of information to an article, but it needs to be [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verifiable]]. This is especially important for a controversial fact in a biography of a living person. Regardless of the law, that is our [[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines|policy]].
[AnonEMouse]: You're welcome. Good luck! If we can convey the same information without giving offense, we certainly should.
[AnonEMouse]: Thanks, that's kind of you.
[AnonEMouse]: Oh, I remember our compromise to make it only a link, but you didn't do that, you just removed. That's why I wrote to ask if our compromise was still on. Since it seems to be, hopefully my restoring the link is OK.
[AnonEMouse]: Thanks, that's basically what the other reviewers wrote. I'll add it to the review. However, I've noticed that it's a lot harder for me to actually put the reviewer comments into practice than it was for you - with Babb, I would write something, and you would do it, while with Jameson, it's taking many days for me to make better paragraphs out of the broken points.
[AnonEMouse]: On a side note, how do I tell it's a school IP?
[AnonEMouse]: My rationale for 48 was that vandalism has been once a day for the last 4 days, so 24 might not have any effect. A half hour certainly wouldn't have any effect. There had been a 24 hour block a few months ago. If it's a school and it's Friday, the distinction between 24 and 48 may be moot, of course.
[AnonEMouse]: That's [[Judgement of Paris#The story|fair]] enough. :-)
[AnonEMouse]: Thank you, and good luck in your efforts.
[AnonEMouse]: Considering you have more support than any other candidate, as well as a history of support from [[User:Jimbo Wales|our founder]], I really, really hope that's true. I guess what I'm afraid of is a smaller version of the [[iron law of oligarchy]]. A star chamber is more efficient than an open process, no way around it. It just causes resentment. Transparency has been an important issue, enough so that several candidates cited it as their reason for running. Then, of course, they all supported you, so maybe they are smarter than I am! :-). Thanks for responding.
[AnonEMouse]: If you can rewrite so I can understand what you mean, I won't change to support, but I will even withdraw the opposition. I'm big on intelligent, understandable arbcom statements. You've achieved the intelligent part - probably - now if only I understood what you were writing! :-)
[AnonEMouse]: Also, if that lonely opposition can get you to pay a bit more attention to transparency in decisions when you are elected, it will have been more than worth while. :-).
[AnonEMouse]: I'm sorry, I need a couple of links. I looked through a couple of histories, and have no idea what you must be talking about. I think I'm more dim than usual today.
[AnonEMouse]: Looks like it closed before I got there. The article [[Bryan Brandenburg]] is overloaded with minor sources, but doesn't look terrible. Don't kill yourselves over this, it's not the end of the world.
[AnonEMouse]: You have a point. I moved the UninvitedCompany comment to the talk page; I assume this is the one you meant: [[Wikipedia_talk:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2006\/Vote\/UninvitedCompany#AnonEMouse_concerns]]. Though I'm not an uninvolved party, I hope that's still all right. :-)
[AnonEMouse]: Wow, worse than Geogre. I thought I knew your problems with Geogre, related to turning up the heat in the Giano case ... but what has Paul August done? He seems quite innocuous, dedicated, and non-controversial.
[AnonEMouse]: I put the text from several deleted revisions in [[User:Willscrlt\/Incredible Hulk (cocktail)]] - but, frankly, there's not much there. One was actually referenced, which looked good, but the reference doesn't actually say what the article writer wanted it to say.
[AnonEMouse]: Oh, and more general advice? Don't take it so hard. It's not the end of the world that Wikipedia sits a few weeks or months without this information. Really. It will all turn out for the best in the end - eventually someone will find or write a better source for this information, and we will be able to write a good enough article with sufficient content and references. Meanwhile, even if a few people did come looking for a recipe for the Incredible Hulk, and had to find it elsewhere, or even make Martinis or Screwdrivers instead, I don't think they suffered long.
[AnonEMouse]: Put them all together and you just might squeak by. I'll lean on Crz a bit not to speedy it while you're working for a few days. But if by chance it gets deleted again, don't panic even so, see above.
[AnonEMouse]: Whoo. Deep waters. Yes, from reading the article, it seems the main backing for the controversy is a single book by Ankerberg and Weldon. (By the way, the links pointing to it don't work for me.) I'll opine in the AfD, [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\/Jahbulon (3rd nomination)]].
[AnonEMouse]: Err. On the other hand, the [[Talk:Jahbulon#Mainstream sources]] talk page note about the ''Religion in the Contemporary World'' makes me change my mind. That seems to be a mainstream book, and if it really says, \""They have therefore been repeatedly embarassed by repeated accusations that theirs is an occult faith which worships a composite deity called Jahbulon, who is different from the god of the world's great religions.\"", then it clearly thinks this is a notable concept. FRINGE calls for extensive discussion, and while this source isn't extensive discussion in itself, it does assert that there has been such. That's close enough. \""Jahbulon\"" also seems to get 18,000 Google hits, which isn't everything, but isn't chopped liver either. Sorry. Keep it.
[AnonEMouse]: Added both deleted revisions.
[AnonEMouse]: Also added a couple of references to [[Backdraft (drink)]]. They're not great, but they are better than nothing.
[AnonEMouse]: The AfD, like most of them, was based on the state of the article at the time, which had no references. Also, it was nominated by a certain legend... But it's not important, the article isn't ready for recreation yet, and may never be. We'll argue it out should it come to that. Thanks for stating your view.
[AnonEMouse]: # Finally - let's see. I wrote the article over several days, found a good number of sources, edited, re-edited, nominated it for DYK, edited the DYK nomination repeatedly, and apparently care about this sort of thing, given that I plaster DYK banners all over my user page. Hmm. Is it really that much of a mystery how I would feel if that article were casually deleted for not being important?
[AnonEMouse]: This seems like an excellent thing to discuss on [[User talk:Dekkappai\/List of Japanese AV actresses, 1980s|the article talk page]]. I put my comments there.
[AnonEMouse]: Thanks! Can't take all the credit, though, seems that just yesterday [[User:Chidom]] and [[User:Tabercil]] gave me notable help.
[AnonEMouse]: The straw poll on the article talk page, [[Talk:List of cocktails#External Links]], seems like an exceelent idea - you may be able to get opinions from experts, of which I'm not one. From looking at the sites myself, the information on all the sites does seem to be rather similar. However, we can count numbers. http:\/\/www.goodcocktails.com\/recipes\/drinks.php | ALL says 1239 recipes. http:\/\/www.1001cocktails.com\/recipes\/ claims 2636 recipes. http:\/\/www.cocktaildb.com\/index doesn't specify. That would seem to me to be an argument to include the second as well.
[AnonEMouse]: That's not really discussion of the books, that's two list entries. There is nothing that indicates the books were in any way special to the article, it bears a list of a dozen of them. The intention of the {{tl|bookcover}} tags are for articles primarily, or to a large part about the books themselves. To cite one example we both know :-), the [[How to Make Love Like a Porn Star]] article is about the book itself, and the [[Jenna Jameson]] article devotes almost as much space to the same book's major effect on the career of the performer - those can be standards to shoot for. If the article discusses how Lukas got a significant portion of his fame from one particular book, that would be a good fair use justification for the cover being used there. It's also useful as a specific counter-example - ''XXX: 30 Porn-Star Photographs'' uses Jenna Jameson on its front cover, but there isn't anything special about it in her career, she's appeared on quite a few covers, it wouldn't be fair use in her article either. Of course Jenna is an article we've worked hard on specifically for it to be a model to others. Here are a few uses that aren't quite as polished, but still fair use, I believe: [[Gang bang]] - where over half of the article is indirectly about the effect of the series being portrayed, and two paragraphs are specifically about the first two specific films in the series whose covers are shown. Here is another, [[Clare Short]], where the book is directly described in only a few sentences, but it is an autobiography, and covers the events of the article. That last one could probably use more on the book itself, actually.
[AnonEMouse]: Thank you for your response. I took the liberty of copying it to [[Template talk:Cquote#WP:BRD time]] to keep all the discussion in one place, and I also responded there.
[AnonEMouse]: Hurrah, hurrah, hurray! Yes, that is my eventual goal. Thank you very much!
[AnonEMouse]: Nice to see you back. I was coming to give you a resiliency barnstar, but see you already have three in as many days, so will hold off on mine. I am still happy that you can stick around after an overreaction from the arbcom.
[AnonEMouse]: The first seems overreaction, I'll ask JzG if we can unblock. The second is correct, though it would have to be rather extreme to cause actual banning (but has happened). You want to see [[Wikipedia:Spam#Votestacking]] and similar sections. The relevant issue is the formation of \""factions\"", that would prowl the Wikipedia and be able to set policy or delete or keep articles by sheer weight of numbers, rather than argument. Since there really are thousands of editors here, if you work at it just a bit, by looking through edit histories of likely articles and see how each edited, you can probably build up a good sized voting bloc for nearly any issue you feel like.
[AnonEMouse]: Thank you both very, very much for the thorough research! Responded in more detail on [[Talk:Jenna Jameson#Jenna's autobiography|the article talk page]]. --
[AnonEMouse]: I gather someone GA'd it already. Anyway, I added just a few comments to the review, per request. :-).
[AnonEMouse]: Thank you. It was apparently removed by a vandal. (See her very next edit: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Andrea_Mackris&diff=97128336&oldid=97128216]). I've restored it.
[AnonEMouse]: Makes sense now, thanks. Carry on. I think I saw your will to live somewhere - could it have rolled under the couch?
[AnonEMouse]: Well, we can write \""then-husband\"" or something, I guess, but it's clumsy. Here's a [[Wikipedia: Featured article]], [[Gerald Ford#Accession]] picture caption: \""Vice President Ford is sworn in as the 38th President of the United States\"" - he's not the Vice President any more, but was at the time. [[Gerald Ford#Foreign policy]] \""Ford meets with Soviet Union leader Leonid Brezhnev\"" - he's not the SU leader any more. [[Wikipedia:Captions]] doesn't specify, but does point to  http:\/\/www.poynter.org\/content\/content_view.asp?id=4355 which says we should use the present tense, and the specific example \""Mayor David Dinkins, 1993\"" - it was posted in 2000, so he's not mayor any more. Do you think there's a Wikipedia style guideline somewhere we can refer to?
[AnonEMouse]: Aagh! Death threat! Indefinite block!
[AnonEMouse]: I was told - at nearly the last minute, too! I would never have forgiven anyone concerned if I didn't even get to put in a kudo. Do you think you'll make 300? I don't watch RFA or your talk page as closely as I should, clearly. You're not a self-promoting spammer if you write to someone who wanted to co-nominate you! I've never nominated anyone yet. Sigh. Always a bridesmouse... :-)
[AnonEMouse]: Just keep doing with the mop what you have been encouraging others to do when you haven't had it. That will be more than enough reward.
[AnonEMouse]: All right, that's \""what one mouse learned about SSP\"". I'll be trying to close a few more cases off and on, but would certainly appreciate all the help you can give. Good luck.
[AnonEMouse]: Here, just a brief skim through the user contributions on [[Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets\/JINXTENGU]] looks ''very'' straight forward - want to start with it?
[AnonEMouse]: As discussed on the section you started on the talk page, [[Talk:Elonka Dunin#Original research\/unsourced claims]] there is an excellent source right in the section you deleted.
[AnonEMouse]: As discussed on the section you started on the talk page, [[Talk:Elonka Dunin#Original research\/unsourced claims]] there is an excellent source right in the section you deleted.
[AnonEMouse]: That's from an article by CNN, however CNN got it, that makes it perfectly good enough. It is not for us to question ''their'' methods, they're the reliable source, we merely report on what they say. Frankly, 90% of the information in any CNN article will come from what people say, we have to trust their judgement in what they print. It's not as if this were a particularly controversial fact. If you want to rewrite the sentence so it makes this more clear, feel free, but if you strike it as unsourced, I'm going to have to revert you. Personally I don't have a stake in Elonka's fame or fortune, but her article has been a target for many people with no good reason.
[AnonEMouse]: <font size=10 color=red>Aieeee!!!<\/font> I understand why Travb chose me, because I've been the most active admin closing sock puppet cases on that terribly backlogged page; also because as part of that effort, I edited the case page to make the section headings conform to the bigger page. I can also understand your strong feelings over this one. Still, please, folks, try hard to be ''concise''. I know it's an effort. There is already plenty to read on the page in that case. Here, can I offer that the most concise person wins? No, I guess not. I've been trying to do the most backlogged ones first, but OK, you've convinced me, I will take a look at this erupting volcano, even out of turn. But it will take me a while, just because of the sheer volume of stuff I have to read and investigate. Unless you can be ''extremely concise, brief, terse even'', hold your fire, please. Otherwise it will be like [[Achilles and the Tortoise]] (I hope that's not a red link), where I can never decide because I can never catch up to the latest voluminous outburst.
[AnonEMouse]: Case closed, the only way it could have been, really. Whew.
[AnonEMouse]: Did I mention Aieee ? I guess not. Anyway, the two sections you mention seem to only duplicate other information already on that talk page. So they're redundant, and heavily misspelled, but not really anything new. They're clearly ''not nice'' but taking it to [[WP:AN\/I]] would either continue or escalate the conflict. How about offering to make peace instead? Compromise, collaboration, consensus are much more productive. In the end, we are all trying to make a free encyclopedia, that's a pretty good thing. Surely we can do it nicely.
[AnonEMouse]: You're quite right, will restore image. My apologies.
[AnonEMouse]: That was [[Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets\/J.Alonso|this one]], I believe. De nada - vaya con dios. :-). --
[AnonEMouse]: VP was blocked for being a sock puppet of [[User:Kdbuffalo]], which I am not convinced he is. They seem to have a different style, edit from different networks, and from the contributions I read, VP does seem to make arguments rather than vandalize. That implies strongly that there may be a constructive user there if we can be civil to him rather than continue to block him on reflexive and questionable grounds. Also, you may notice that the current strategy, of blocking IP addresses as they are used, isn't tremendously effective. VP seems to have no difficulty picking another IP address as the previous ones are blocked. You write \""The various Evolution and Creation articles have less intrusive editing and discussion ever since he and a couple of other users were permanently banned.\"" but that's clearly not true, as you can see [[Special:Contributions\/199.62.0.252]] edited Talk:Evolution <s>just today<\/s>. I'll carry on with the futile strategy if there is no other choice, but I really hope there is a better one. --
[AnonEMouse]: You are right, I misread the month, Jan 5, rather than Feb 5. Still after the blocks, but not today. --
[AnonEMouse]: According to [[Special:Log\/block?page=User:VacuousPoet]], which you should be able to read, he was blocked by [[User:Pschemp]] with the comment ''(sockpuppet of Kdbuffalo, single purpose account, here only to disrupt evolution relateated articles.)''. Nothing there or in his [[Special:Contributions\/VacuousPoet]] about deleting talk pages en masse - his contributions are merely reasoned argument, fervent, but not really more so than those he is arguing against. ([http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Talk:Evolution&diff=95982117&oldid=95979569 \""You should thank your mythical god\""], for example?) I, and most admins, can not check IP addresses, that is limited to a small group of accounts with [[m:CheckUser policy]] rights. However, the Kdbuffalo account was accused of editing from the [[SUNY Buffalo]] campus network, while the VacuousPoet IPs use FrontierNet and NJ networks. Not out of the question, of course, but not contributive evidence. --
[AnonEMouse]: Absolutely with the strictest understanding, yes. From reading the talk page of [[Evolution]] it seems that both sides have been diverted into arguing about the truth or falsehood of the theory than about the state of the article. But let's see if he even asks. --
[AnonEMouse]: Not sure what you mean by \""honorable\"", I don't think I wrote that. I do believe he wasn't a blatant vandal, and did make some effort to be constructive. I looked through [[Special:Contributions\/170.215.45.95]], and the talk page removals I could find were [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Talk:Evolution&diff=prev&oldid=96009160 ''(Attempting to remove flames against religions and posters)''] - a fairly accurate description; and [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Talk:Evolution&diff=prev&oldid=96012234], and [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Talk:Evolution&diff=prev&oldid=96025665] - which are clearly not nice, worth warning or even blocking, but hardly an indefinite block. He did avoid the block, but it was indefinite, he could hardly have waited it out, and I believe the block reason to have been incorrect. Yes, he did make a false accusation of sock puppetry, but he was not disrupting the encyclopedia for fun. Yes, I know Buffalo and Rochester are in the same state, and New Jersey is a neighboring state; but that merely means they're part of the same several million people, we can't automatically assume all New York State creationists are [[User:Kdbuffalo]]. [[Special:Contributions\/Kdbuffalo]] seem far more wide-ranging than those of the admitted IPs of VacuousPoet. --
[AnonEMouse]: Thank you very much! Take a look a bit higher on this talk page for when FT2 asked for advice, most of what I wrote there should still be good.  --
[AnonEMouse]: I've looked at your recent work, and it seems fine. Thank you again! --
[AnonEMouse]: I remember, I remember. I will help, even more when when the Jenna FAC is over. I'm just slow - I'm not exaggerating that the Jenna Jameson work took me 6 months. But I will help.
[AnonEMouse]: Why did you add warnings about one edit, which I had warned about an hour before, and another, which took place 10 days ago? (assuming you meant [[Michael Anthony]]?) See the dates on [[Special:Contributions\/207.10.170.13]] --
[AnonEMouse]: I see you did something similar on [[User talk:72.144.156.114]]. IP addresses are often not used by a single specific person, but can belong to internet cafes, public libraries, schools, and so forth. If an IP hasn't edited in days between edits, odds are reasonable that the next edit won't come from the same person who made the last one, so warning about edits a long time ago may not be as useful as they may seem. --
[AnonEMouse]: Maybe a quarter of the drama took place on AN and ANI; it's linked to all over the place from [[Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration\/Giano\/Evidence]]. For just one example, see the evidence posted by a certain [[User: Bishonen]]: \""...Tony posted the block for review on ANI, and it was quickly undone...[it] received a whirlwind of attention...\"". If you want influential opinions about administrator action, before taking it all the way to arbcom, AN and AN\/I are clearly the places to go. --
[AnonEMouse]: --
[AnonEMouse]: Not me that much - unless it involves a porn star, then I'll take it. The [[Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons\/Noticeboard]] seems to be hit or miss, but you should certainly start there. If it's urgent, or getting into a firefight, you want to post on [[WP:AN\/I]], that tends to get fairly fast responses. If you want specific admins, I've noticed [[User:SlimVirgin]] quite interested in BLP issues; she tends to be on the side of concealing embarassing information where possible, and she's ''very'' experienced. I met [[User:Bastique]] in BLP circumstances a while ago, he's not as experienced as SV (few are), but seems to be active in answering foundation mail and similar issues. AnnH ([[User:Musical Linguist]]) showed up on T:BLP recently. That should be several. --
[AnonEMouse]: Want me to copy this somewhere?  --
[AnonEMouse]: Thanks - but don't forget WP:DATE the deathdate in the opening, and the various kings and Kings... --
[AnonEMouse]: Thanks for your help. I respect your opinion, if you can point to any awkward bits that might be improved, I will try to do so. --
[AnonEMouse]: Heavens, I didn't think you would object to being called a good editor! But OK, will strike. --
[AnonEMouse]: With all due respect, Wt's complaint is basically wrong. I could only find one example of a quote that could be read as if it were presented as fact; I changed it, and [[User_talk:Worldtraveller#Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates.2FJenna_Jameson|asked him for others]] - he never provided any, and it has been a week. (Feel free to find some yourself, by the way.) If you read my opening to the FAC, you will notice that most of the article was written from articles, not using her autobiography at all, specifically to forestall such an objection. (See [[Talk:Jenna_Jameson\/Archive_2#Jenna.27s_autobiography]] for the long discussion where I was finally convinced to use it in a few places.) Just from a sheer count of citations from the [[Jenna_Jameson#References|references]], you will see the main sources are the New York Times article, the Forbes article, and the E! biography, which are all as much secondary sources as any biography. Read them, they're not interviews, they don't state \""Jenna Jameson has said ...\"" or I would have written that. They have satisfied themselves that the things they write ''are facts'' to their standards, which are pretty high; they would stand up to those of a hardcover biography any day. Did they use her words? Probably. Did they rely on her words? Don't know. We'd face the same problem with a book length biography - except that [[Kitty Kelley]] doesn't have the cachet of Forbes or the Times. --
[AnonEMouse]: So in short, I did some, disagreed with others, especially the \""cut by half\"" parts, and there are a couple of bits I could agree to remove if I could be convinced they were motivated more by the effort to genuinely improve the article rather than just shorten it for Wt's less than satisfactory reasons. --
[AnonEMouse]: Better and better. I've withdrawn the objection, still needs more to get my support. I've written a long list at [[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates\/Raoul Wallenberg]], but basically keep adding interesting information from the many available sources. --
[AnonEMouse]: Thank you, thank you, I'm still walking on air! --
[AnonEMouse]: ::I did look at them, but will again.--
[AnonEMouse]: ::Not a PR blurb, but an article published in two reputable newspapers, a fine secondary source. Will look at rephrasing anyway.--
[AnonEMouse]: ::Just curious, whom would you consider \""a wll known reviewer\"" of pornography? [[Ted Sturgeon]] hasn't been reviewing porn for decades. ''[[Salon]]'' and ''[[AskMen]]'' are better known than any modern reviewers I've heard of. --
[AnonEMouse]: ::To her, and to the article. It's a serious effort to try to join those two rather contradicting modes; that she tries to do so is worth a few words. --
[AnonEMouse]: Please do. Great minds think alike - I was just thinking I should do that. :-). BTW, most of the \""done\"" bits were made by Addhoc after the FAC closed. --
[AnonEMouse]: For this specific question, I went to see how [[Wikipedia:Featured articles]] do it. I found [[Eric_Bana#Filmography]] and [[Henry Fonda filmography]] (not a FA itself, but clearly a sub-article of [[Henry Fonda]], which is) which both use tables somewhat like yours. So you're at least on reasonably safe grounds, and at least have a model to follow. I would recommend removing the yellow color (especially when talking about Japanese actresses!); otherwise you have a few more columns, but I doubt that will be a major problem. Different titles in Japanese and English are probably important. You lack \""role\"", but given the genre, I doubt that's important. Company, Director seems OK. If all the entries are going to be about 70-90 minutes in length, that column can probably go - it could be important if some are 30 and some are 120. --
[AnonEMouse]: Thanks, fixed. --
[AnonEMouse]: I'd say every few minutes, but that's still a lot, and different IPs, so we can't just block them. Semi-protected for 24 hours. Just curious, why did you pick me as your admin of choice? --
[AnonEMouse]: Oh, absolutely. He's also broken [[WP:AGF]] lots of times, and lots of other things. But he's not doing it here. And he's not asking to be reviewed, you are. --
[AnonEMouse]: Understood. To be a good admin, you have to be able to hide your dislike of authoritarian figures... among others. :-). Let's just put it you have to be able to hide your dislike in general. Good luck. --
[AnonEMouse]: Heh, heh. Sure, why not. Feel free. However, don't think that I will be able to affect him in any way. I'm just a mouse (OK, one with a mop, but so are 1000 others). --
[AnonEMouse]: Can you provide a link to the previous sockpuppet case? Sorry, but I've closed so many, I don't recall this one without a link. -
[AnonEMouse]: Meanwhile, please note this. We're here to make the world's best encyclopedia, not refight wars in text form. That means that the thing to do here is not to make enemies and try to have them blocked, the thing to do is to write good articles. When someone says \""I don't think there are X million Bosniaks, I think there are Y\"", the thing to do isn't to go running to an administrator, the thing to do is to find a good reliable source that says there are X million, and include that in the article. If the other person then finds a good reliable source that says there are Y, then you include that too, and note in the article that there is a substantial disagreement. Remember also that while people are human, and will get mad, and will have bad days, and will make mistakes, the odds are good that most editors you will find here at least at first came here to try and make the world's best encyclopedia. Try to cooperate with them. Honestly. [[Wikipedia:Assume good faith]]. So many of your examples above could be taken either as good faith edits, if a little brusque, that I really don't think you are doing that all the time. Try it. Sometimes just the act of assuming good faith will convince someone to work with you, instead of against you. It won't always work, but sometimes it will. --
[AnonEMouse]: Meanwhile, bon voyage! What are all the FACs going to do without you? Expect to find nothing but Pokemon in the lineup for the front page when you come back... :-) --
[AnonEMouse]: Input? ... inputted? ... put in? ... better not go farther considering the subject matter... :-). --
[AnonEMouse]: Weighed in. Have you seen [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Porn stars\/Deletion]] (also reachable as [[WP:P*\/D]])? It's supposed to be a common noticeboard for such things. --
[AnonEMouse]: Thanks for the notice, I appreciate it. Perhaps I will, but not quite this minute, I've been undeservedly rude to good people, and don't want to do it again. --
[AnonEMouse]: I apologize, I was out of line. I removed those comments, rephrasing the statement. I did and do mean the part about respecting your work. Bish had a point that I was misusing her talk page to debate her friends who were harmlessly blowing off steam. Please go on writing good articles, whether or not you want to seek the star for them (even if they won't meet FA standards, they'll certainly be better than 90% of the WP), and please do go on using her talk page to vent. I should not have jumped on that, and shall avoid it. --
[AnonEMouse]: Specifically in this case, I am inclined to urge leaving Epbr123 alone a bit. Yes, he did push the boundaries of making a point by a string of AfD nominations, but his explanation that he did it in good faith to determine deletion standards is also possible, and I am impressed that in at least one case he changed his mind due to good arguments. And some of his nominations were fully worthwhile ones; note that such noted champions of [[WP:P*]] as [[User:Tabercil]] and [[User:Joe Beaudoin Jr.]] are also known for nominating not notable porn star articles for deletion. We're not solely inclusionists - even I occasionally argue to delete something. :-) In short, I think Epbr123's heart may be in the right place, and if we give him a fair chance, he may turn out an asset to both [[WP:P*]] and the Wikipedia as a whole. --
[AnonEMouse]: I begin to see your point. :-(. --
[AnonEMouse]: Aaaaaaaaaaaaa! It looked like it might be going well, finally, after that chat on Epbr123's talk page. Then I log out for a few hours, and it's spread to [[WP:ANI]], revenge deletion nominations (possibly appropriate ones, but still)... Folks, please, play nice. I'll go to ANI, which seems to be the most active place that isn't deleted several times a day. :-( --
[AnonEMouse]: On further inspection, it seems like he is going more slowly now, that is a useful difference. If nothing else, will reduce the amount of damage. :-). --
[AnonEMouse]: No, no. [[Thalia festiny]] for example is hardly a bad faith nomination. I don't know if I agree with all the people asking for it to be actually speedied on [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\/Thalia festiny]], but they certainly have a point. For goodness sakes, the article meets [[Wikipedia:Geogre's Law]]! If they're all like that, he's doing a good thing. --
[AnonEMouse]: Oh Mickey and Minnie. Why do this and Betacommand have to come up at the same time? <small>Someone send me a simple straightforward vandal I can just block!<\/small> Sigh. An AfD takes 5 days, and saving a good article takes a bit of research which takes time.  Betacommand, on the other hand, has shown that he can take out external links faster than a speeding bullet; he's also an admin, which is a separate can of worms. If you don't know what that's about, take a look at [[WP:AN\/I#Proposal]] - but for heaven's sakes don't get involved, that's enough of a firefight. Can I ask you guys to save the articles you can (and want to) for just a few days, and not to get into any fights enough to risk getting blocked yourselves? --
[AnonEMouse]: Sorry, wasn't referring to you, just a general mouse expletive. ;-). --
[AnonEMouse]: No, he actually changed it back to 100 from 75, which is a good thing, as I didn't notice the drop either. As for changing the nomination statement, that's not a capital crime - for legibility it probably should have been put as a response to the keep argument, but that's a fine point. It was quite short before, one word. He did evidence a misunderstanding about the 100 film rule in a few places which I addressed at his talk page. Come on, he's making useful comments on the [[WP:PORNBIO]] talk page, give him a bit of a break. --
[AnonEMouse]: I've been keeping the FAC on my watch list but not the article itself. You seem to have gotten everything I asked for. Supporting. --
[AnonEMouse]: I'm not sure what you mean here. CN is for discussing community blocks, right? Are you proposing one? Seems unnecessary. Personally I see poor Deathrocker as a well intentioned user who doesn't do well with things like rules (what a shock for someone focusing on heavy metal music). If there is a way to keep him from being indefinitely blocked (I agree a year is almost the same thing) then I'd be in favor of it, I just don't know how to do that. If I knew anything about heavy metal, I could try and deal with the individual issues, but I don't. --
[AnonEMouse]: Not quite sure myself. :-). At first, I thought every party should create their own subsection, like mine, and I even created the headings for you other 3. Then Tony Sidaway, who was an arbcom clerk for a long time, took those blank sections away, saying everyone should create their own. If you have something to say, you should probably create your own section, but note that for now, this is supposed to be the time when the arbcom decides to take or not to take this case, so this really should  be about that. If you have something about Betacommand that I haven't written, please do write it. (For example, as I recommended to Chris: \""I think Betacommand is the salt of the earth and should be entrusted to the keys to the city; dismiss this case at once...\"") While your block of Bc was probably notable, I don't think it will make the difference to the arbcom taking or not taking the case, so if you just want to defend yourself, then you probably want to build your statement in a user subpage or something, then put it on the Evidence subpage if and when the case is accepted. (BTW, don't be scared because Tony thinks your block was spectacularly inappropriate or whatever he wrote - though he is an experienced clerk, so I'll trust his word for the procedural side, the impact of his statements on recent arbcom cases have been [[Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration\/InShaneee\/Proposed_decision#Tony_Sidaway_banned_from_Arbitration_pages|not quite what he might want them to be]].) --
[AnonEMouse]: All right, it's Monday, I looked at a bunch of his nominations. He really is nominating stuff worthy of deletion; a few so clear but not yet unanimous that even I had to support deletion on them. I only wrote keep on one or two. (I avoided the obvious snowball keep or delete ones) I was amused by Dekkapai's supporting deletion despite the nominator on a couple - and one where Dek was supporting Ebpr123 defending one of his porn star articles from deletion! :-) Come on guys, he is rough around the edges, but clearly means well. He's gotten better since the first days. I think he'll be a valuable WP:P* member, and that, frankly, is worth a few marginal articles that will never be more than stubs. --
[AnonEMouse]: I think I stuck that in the middle of my statement (chronologically): \""As part of the fallout, he apparently lost Bot approval rights: [[Wikipedia talk:Bots\/Approvals group#Betacommand]]; [[Wikipedia:Bureaucrats' noticeboard#Another bot deflagging]]\"" - is that good enough, or would you like me to do something more? --
[AnonEMouse]: I agree. I don't plan to bring it up there, and didn't think I suggested it. I'm still not sure what you are proposing. --
[AnonEMouse]: I restored the links to [[Elonka Dunin]] from the [[List of people from Los Angeles]] and [[Santa Monica, California]]. Her work as an editor should not have any influence on the way we treat her article. And, frankly, it's hard to believe her ego could be large enough to be unusual on a list of LA movie stars, who are hardly known for being modest and self effacing. :-) --
[AnonEMouse]: I understand about canvassing, that's why I'm specifically asking to be notified. See [[Wikipedia:Canvassing#Friendly_notice]]. I'm making an unsolicited request. Come on, admit that it's probably a surprise to you that someone who doesn't like your proposal will want to support you for admin. :-) --
[AnonEMouse]: Sounds good to me. Go for it. Make the section, and I'll sign on. --
[AnonEMouse]: My advice is not to sweat the Conflict of Interest business too much. Yes, it's an issue, but focusing on it will just lead you into a personal conflict with that user, and won't help the article. Instead, focus on making the article broader, expanding it rather than contracting it. Then, after you have covered Agile CMMI thoroughly, it should be clear just how big a player Dalton and Broadsword are, and how much space to give them in the article. If you want someone else to advise you or help, take a look at the contributions history of the [[CMMI]] and [[Agile software development]] articles. Relatively experienced contributors to one or both seem to include [[User:Ashleyvh]], [[User:Boson]] .... Ah, here! [[User:A Train]] is not only a contributor to the Agile software development article, but also an admin. And his username starts with A! Perfect! Let me see if I can dump this in his lap. :-) --
[AnonEMouse]: :-(. Unfortunately ATrain disclaims specialized knowledge of the subject. [[User_talk:A_Train#WP:COI_on_Agile_CMMI]]. --
[AnonEMouse]: Now, let's see - what do you believe \""notability guidelines to be mentioned as being notable for her geographic location\"" are, and what is that based on? [[List of people from Los Angeles]] includes hundreds of entries and people as famous as [[Ace Young]] and [[Elliott Yamin]]. I think the reasonable conclusion is that the \""notability guidelines\"" being used are, in fact, our standard notability guideline, [[Wikipedia:Notability (people)]]. If there is a different Wikipedia notability guideline which you mean, please point to it. --
[AnonEMouse]: Perfectly all right. As I wrote, I was simultaneously over and under whelmed by the evidence, a checkuser would also be OK. --
[AnonEMouse]: I'll make a note, though - so far, out of half a dozen checkuser requests I've made for SSP work, not one has been approved. I guess that has discouraged me from seeking them. Here's hoping you have better luck, though. --
[AnonEMouse]: That account was blocked in December by [[User:Jayjg|Jayjg]], apparently for similar reasons. --
[AnonEMouse]: Thanks for answering mine as well. Darn, I was considering changing to oppose after the history the others found, then you go and write something eminently reasonable. I don't suppose you could go and perform some blatant personal attacks or vandalism or something so that I could make up my mind? :-) --
[AnonEMouse]: You're welcome. Some people take this place much too seriously. --
[AnonEMouse]: I'm sorry. In a way it's admirable that you won't change your views to get votes. But in a way it also means you aren't that interested in the consensus of the community. You're very honest, and if you think you can adjust, I'll believe you; but the converse is also true, if you honestly believe you can't adjust, then, well, I have to believe that as well. --
[AnonEMouse]: Thank you! I'm amazed how few you have, I expected a maze of barnstars. --
[AnonEMouse]: Don't take the \""snub\"" comment seriously, I see there was a long line. You're a great asset. I see you sprung straight into action with [[Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets\/Giovanni Giove (2nd)]], which I was hoping you would look into. Thank you, appreciated. --
[AnonEMouse]: Right. I'm not sure what possessed me there. Thanks. --
[AnonEMouse]: Anyway, I can delete your user page and talk page, but not your list of contributions, that's an irrevocable part of history. Is that good enough? --
[AnonEMouse]: One at a time... --
[AnonEMouse]: See, you're not ''blocked''; \""I want to leave\"" isn't a reason to block someone. If you want to leave, you just leave. However, that means you can also come back whenever you feel like, without any hassle. And when or if you do (as I hope you do), it would be useful for people to be able to communicate with you, without any hassle. So unless you really have a strong reason to suspect they're going to be regularly vandalized, I'd prefer to leave them unprotected. --
[AnonEMouse]: No -- at least nothing I could find on [[Wikipedia:Protection policy]] says so. I could be wrong -- if another admin protects them, I certainly won't un-protect -- but my reading of policy and usual behavior is that protection is only used when it has to be, not just when it's asked for. --
[AnonEMouse]: Well, I didn't protect it, so you'll have to ask those admins ([[User:Kingboyk]], [[User:Tom harrison]]). I probably wouldn't have protected it. However, note that it had gotten [[User talk:Phaedriel\/Archive 22|a whole slew]] of unanswered messages since her absence, and there ''is'' a possible exceptional circumstance that I'd rather not give details about. But ask them, maybe they will feel those reasons apply to you as well. --
[AnonEMouse]: Thank you, thank you. :-) Bask, bask, wriggle, wriggle. :-) --
[AnonEMouse]: WP:PROF, WP:MUSIC, and yes, WP:PORNBIO are like that. There are notable and non-notable professors, but the dividing line for them isn't the same as for normal people; publishing a dozen book-length articles makes most people notable, for a professor it's just average if no one reads the articles. Similarly, there are notable and non-notable pornstars, and the criteria that make them notable or not are not the obvious ones either. --
[AnonEMouse]: Aieee. This is territory in which angels fear to tread. The principle is certainly good, but it seems that the application leaves something to be desired. If even Radiant!, who was the one who bravely (and\/or recklessly!) dropped the {{tl|guideline}} marker on [[Wikipedia:Notability]], doesn't like it, I'm afraid to endorse it. I'm ''sure'' he has been following the issues more closely than I have. --
[AnonEMouse]: Yeah. Again, tough call, but the edit history is very similar (Sean Paul, Bratz, Wrestling, and related video games), and the information added is consistently uncited, and does seem to be false. (Comparing: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Hero_%28Chad_Kroeger_song%29&diff=prev&oldid=120525051] and [http:\/\/www.allmusic.com\/cg\/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:89txlf3e5czr]). Will block. --
[AnonEMouse]: As for Crz, I asked, but he was coy. I think it was a combination of factors, some of which I know, and some I don't. Part was when [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship\/Kafziel 2]] failed by the slimmest of margins, a margin that was  only achieved during the extra day and a half it was kept open due to bureaucrats' being inactive. That actually led Crz to [[Wikipedia:Requests for bureaucratship\/Crzrussian|nominate himself for bureaucrat]] ... with predictable results, given he wasn't that experienced an admin yet (By the way, since then, Kafziel learned to channel his marine tendencies a bit, and [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship\/Kafziel 3]] not only succeeded but would have made [[WP:100]], unopposed, were it not closed early... yeah, I know, that doesn't mean much [[WP:200|to you]], but for us mere mortals it's impressive.) But that wasn't the whole reason, I don't know the whole thing. Part was life outside Wiki - if I understood a brief hint from him correctly, he may be absent for much the same happy reason you were. I hope I did understand him correctly, that would be a good reason to be missing. He does check in on Wikipedia events every so often, he was aware of the [[Essjay incident]], and told me I was [[Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration\/Daniel_Brandt_deletion_wheel_war\/Evidence#Evidence_presented_by_AnonEMouse|hard on Yanksox]]. Drop him an email, if I'm right you can discuss cloth-vs-disposable and the finer shades of diagnosis-by-poop-coloration. :-) --
[AnonEMouse]: [[Image:WikiThanks.png|43px|left|WikiThanks]]  Thanks. I haven't been paying as much attention to that as I probably should have, as original filer, but I'm glad you aren't letting it casually decay for lack of prosecution. --
[AnonEMouse]: Wow. I just saw your proposed decision... just reading all that I'm tempted to vote for drawing and quartering, much less arbcom sanctions. I see \""every skeleton in every closet\"" was not an overstatement - remind me never to get you mad. Do you really think he is that bad? --
[AnonEMouse]: That was one complex PS, and I'm not sure I parsed it correctly, but in case I did: please don't take my statement as criticism, simply as amazement at your work. When I brought the case, I did think he was an unrepentant repeat problem admin; 3 prominent incidents in 6 days, with many of the same uncommunicative characteristics, seemed pretty conclusive. But then it was quite a while without major explosions, and several people did speak up for him, so I began to think an intermediate measure was warranted. But then that summing up is pretty damning, you present quite a longer sequence of problems then I had known of. I don't know where to write any of that in the case pages, it's not evidence, it's not workshop proposal, it's just stream-of-consciousness ramblings. In the end, I think I'm going to take real joy at not being an arbitrator, and so being able to let you folks do it, and not having to personally make the tough choice between desysopping a well meaning, poorly communicating, administrator, or possibly not doing it and facing another series of incidents. That's why you folks make the big bucks. --
[AnonEMouse]: Thanks. I organized it on the model of the other [[Wikipedia:Featured Articles]] about living actresses, like [[Angelina Jolie]], [[Diane Keaton]], etc., that do split off the relationships sections. But I can see the point that it would be easier to update with new events if it were strictly chronological. Thanks again for helping. --
[AnonEMouse]: I actually think the current article is near optimal - neutral phrasing, covers everything, lots of citations, and watched by lots of eagle eyes. Daniel Brandt seems to be objecting out of principle rather than out of any specific and actionable complaint. --
[AnonEMouse]: What you need to do is go to [[Template:promophoto]] and read what it says there about the incantation. Take a look at [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Image:Rex_Stout_1975.jpg&diff=prev&oldid=119493463 my edit to the Rex Stout image] to see how the magic was worked there. <small>eye_of_newt=3|tongue_of_dog=0 are optional parameters...<\/small> --
[AnonEMouse]: Thanks. I responded there - I edit less on weekends. Many fixed, some not, other issues. I think that as long as Raoul sees that you are addressing concerns, he will leave it up until you either address them all, or we hit some kind of impasse. --
[AnonEMouse]: About one statement from each, minimal back-and-forth, just a statement of where each stands. Kla'quot offered a compromise, that got minimal response, and isn't what you're writing. I know you're more experienced than I am, but can you really read that and call it agreement? --
[AnonEMouse]: I counted him, he's Starblind. Note that the longer version is also the one that was there before the one that came up, so we're talking about making a change to the spirit and letter of the policy here. I'd rather not cast stones at specific editors ... especially since I suspect if you look at it hard enough, I will be among the stone targets! Instead, can we actually try to reach consensus?  By that, I mean something most people can at least live with. Instead, what we have is a revert war, something we as admins really shouldn't be doing, what with \""serving as an example\"" and all. --
[AnonEMouse]: ''(unindent)'' Thanks for that! :-) See, what I'm worried about is that it's too short. All it says is that any admin may choose to protect any deleted biography, it says nothing about not every one needing it, that the protection should be temporary, that other people may have the same name, that another admin may choose to unprotect later. Sure, you all say on the talk page that all that is obvious, but it's not, and it's getting written in to a very important [[Wikipedia:policy]]. Sure, I know that currently experienced admins protect some BLPs, but that's not what it says, it says any admin may protect all of them. I'm ''darn sure'' that in just a few months when the talk page is archived, some enthusiastic new admin will absolutely permanently protect each and every single deleted BLP, forever, and when anyone objects will wrap himself in this sentence like a flag. The longer one, which points to [[WP:SALT]] is not that much longer, and doesn't prevent experienced admins from protecting those BLPs that need it, it merely prevents inexperienced admins from protecting all of them that don't. --
[AnonEMouse]: See, by putting that sentence there, it's no longer \""no reason\"". It's a very good reason, \""it says so in policy\"", and, frankly, even the arbcom would uphold that if the text survived a few months. Note that I'm not asking for much, just a note that [[WP:BLP]] does ''not'' override the much more reasonable discussion at [[WP:SALT]]. Without that note, BLP is a policy and SALT isn't, so BLP certainly does override it. --
[AnonEMouse]: Anyway, that's the entire problem. Just a few posts above you write that if someone actually followed that text as written, they would be \""put right\""! Surely you're not favoring adding incorrect information because it's shorter? If it's wrong, it's not at all clear. --
[AnonEMouse]: Actually, I don't support changing the policy. Check what it looked like just a few days ago [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons&oldid=125917016] before this nonsense started, none of this stuff was there, it's being put in without any consensus. --
[AnonEMouse]: Side comment - can you clean up that article a bit? Stuff like \""We played their music and you decided ... Well, that's a big NO\"" really isn't the tone we want from a neutral encyclopedia article. We should be unbiased, and not that talkative. It's even better to be boring and stuffy, than seem like an ad for the show. --
[AnonEMouse]: Graciella is familiar with the process, but she's been editing since 2005 (longer than I have!). Given that, the fact that she once wrote the same sentence that Ivan Kricancic did is not conclusive. But in any case, that isn't really the issue, is it? It's a content dispute. So, let me give you the same advice I gave Graciella - discuss and reach a compromise. Look at it this way: even let's pretend that you are both die-hard POV warriors, each with a dozen sock puppet accounts. Say we block one or both of you indefinitely. A week or a month later, you'll come back as another user and resume the same war, with just enough differences that it's not immediately obvious. Does that get anywhere? Surely not. Instead, reach a compromise. Where you disagree, each of you cite a reliable source, and \""write the controversy\"". Something like this \""Experienced journalist Mrs. Qwerty of ABCD news organization reported that 5000 people were involved,[3] while highly respected Professor Ghjkl of EFGH university wrote that 30000 people were involved.[4]\"". There. That gets both of your points of view across, in a way that both sides can hopefully live with, and actually makes the article more comprehensive. Then you can both go off and find something else to edit, rather than keeping writing about how the other person should be blocked all the time. That's what the Wikipedia is for, after all, writing articles, not trying to get other people blocked all the time. --
[AnonEMouse]: Uh-oh. Hold on there Graciella. Don't try to cure all the problems in the world at once. As far as I understand from the logs, you've never edited that article, and neither that editor, nor the alleged sock master is you - right? One thing at a time, please. Can you try to solve the first problem before going to look for new ones?--
[AnonEMouse]: I'm not sure if you got the emphasis of my comment. I don't see those two sentences as a big deal. The difference in content is minor. I don't think the game is worth the candle. <small>(aha! I knew I could find another tired old phrase if I worked at it hard enough.)<\/small> So if a mediator really wants to mediate, that's great, but since my personal feeling is that it is not worth it, I don't think my coming in and writing that will help, it might even offend the mediator, who has, after all, devoted a fair amount of good faith effort to the issue. --
[AnonEMouse]: No offense, but I don't know much about [[RuneScape]], so don't know if Guilds are a minor detail or the heart of the whole thing. Maybe you could ask on [[Talk:RuneScape]]? --
[AnonEMouse]: What? No offense, but I don't recall ever editing, writing about, or ever reading the article on [[Scourge (Transformers)]] - what are you referring to, please? --
[AnonEMouse]: --
[AnonEMouse]: Absolutely, improving the article is the idea. I'll return, give me a bit of time. Sorry about the mess comment, I guess it was strong; I was mainly struck by the lead's concentrating on his voice, height, and lack of sex life, meanwhile leaving out items of lesser importance such as why he was a controversial politician, what party he was from, or how or why he was shot. :-) --
[AnonEMouse]: You missed the step (in [[WP:AFD]]) about adding it to today's AFD list. That's necessary, otherwise most people who frequent WP:AFD won't see it, and it's quite likely no closing admin will close and delete it. You could also drop a note about it on the creator's user talk page, in case he doesn't check his watch list. That's merely polite, and gives him more of an opportunity to defend the article. Finally, in the AFD itself, you could provide links to the edits adding information to other actresses' pages. That's evidence. :-) I'll do all that tomorrow if you don't, but for now I'll give you the opportunity to do it. --
[AnonEMouse]: Old joke... [http:\/\/www.mattkruse.com\/humor\/top_9_sex_jokes.txt #8 here] for example. :-) --
[AnonEMouse]: Personally, I agree with most things that Thatcher writes, and would be happy to get a general statement from the arbcom on this, except for one key point - I'm not sufficiently confident that arbcom won't issue (in my opinion) unjustified sanctions in this particular case, given that Fred Bauder and FloNight at least have strongly implied they would like to. That's kind of an important point. It's like asking a US Supreme Court of presidential appointees to rule on a specific closely contested presidential election... I'd be happy to trust them in setting general rules, I'm just worried about the specific sanctions to be handed down on a case where they have already expressed bias. --
[AnonEMouse]: :-) I'm glad. You're right, I don't know you at all the way that Phaedriel, presumably, does (does she know everyone?) but I did read your user page. Thank you very much. --
[AnonEMouse]: Wow, thanks! After AKMask's nice comment, my day is now complete, and couldn't be ruined by two arbcom cases and an RFC. Bring on the vandals! :-) --
[AnonEMouse]: Actually the whole point is that they weren't deleted for any valid reason - there isn't a single derogatory or disputed line in that short text. Without quoting the text, that's just my word for it, with quoting the text, it's obvious. --
[AnonEMouse]: It didn't have a major effect as redirect were automatically set up, but moved back, and  [[User_talk:Gatorphat#Year_and_decade_moves_reversed|Moving user notified.]] Thanks and good luck. --
[AnonEMouse]: Ah, I did promise to get back to that, didn't I? Sorry, sort of got distracted with your impending lynching and all...:-) I added more to [[Wikipedia:Peer review\/Robert Benchley]]: even though it isn't listed on [[WP:PR]], it isn't templated as closed.--
[AnonEMouse]: Put it on [[Wikipedia:Peer review]], that's what that's for. (See below note, conveniently enough.) That way you will (possibly) get comments from more than just me. --
[AnonEMouse]: Did you catch the \""work with me\"" part? You seem to be arguing, rather than genuinely trying to address my concerns. For example \""if he is cited, he is reliable\"" - huh? I can cite my uncle Al,<ref name=uncleAl>Alphonse J. \""The Cheezinator\"" Mouse. Personal statement, [[June 8]], [[2007]]. Retrieved June 8, 2007.<\/ref> does that make him a [[Wikipedia:reliable source]]? Enough of one for a [[Wikipedia:Featured article]], which are supposed to be the best we can offer? In this case Chris Hewitt seems to be a reviewer for EmpireOnline.com - what the heck is that? --
[AnonEMouse]: --
[AnonEMouse]: By the way, recall a few months ago I offered to nominate you for the ability to see deleted articles, among other things? :-) --
[AnonEMouse]: Well done! --
[AnonEMouse]: You're welcome - but I wouldn't overstate the importance of any one picture on her life, considering she has had so many. Does she actually say something like that anywhere? --
[AnonEMouse]: No condescension was intended. Your English is certainly better than my Italian. :-) You're welcome. --
[AnonEMouse]: Hey, I'm not done yet, give me a minute... :-) --
[AnonEMouse]: There. BTW, since it is in your user space, feel free to strike it if you feel it is not suitable, not in the general spirit of the page, or merely insufficiently funny. --
[AnonEMouse]: Want to try it again from the top, without the loaded words? Just the facts about the article in question and the edit in question. --
[AnonEMouse]: There's a \""move\"" link at the top of the page. I googled a bit, and found it each way, actually. Is this him? [http:\/\/www.jpgn.org\/pt\/re\/jpgn\/fulltext.00005176-200406003-00015.htm;jsessionid=G9wLvV6d5yjPdQQppKp8cKqLjQVnZ2DRbPCHJFdj2q6QQD5W2kbX!1354923979!181195628!8091!-1] But then I found the New York Times obit on line, linked to it in the article., and decided to do the move for you as well. [[Merrill Chase]]. Good luck. --
[AnonEMouse]: Now do you understand my problem? This isn't a crusade, this isn't a genocide. This is an encyclopedia. We write articles here. That's all we do. If you want an uninvolved admin's help, I can do that, but please confine yourself to the article, that's all we do here. Now, what's the dispute?  --
[AnonEMouse]: Ah. That's more clear, thanks. Let me go look at the articles in question. --
[AnonEMouse]: Nope - read the talk page section I wrote, the diff is there. I thought that too at first from the edit summaries, then actually looked at the diffs. It seems Spinachmaster thought he was reverting Valrith, and restoring the article to Katjakassin's version, but he wasn't. :-P Considering the subject matter of the article, there is a very appropriate term for this situation: <!-- clusterfuck -->. Everyone meant well, but no one talked to anyone else, and it just got worse. Thanks for letting me know, that article wasn't on my watchlist, and clearly will be now. <small>Ah, a BLP issue that I'll be enforcing, instead of railing against; what's the world coming to? :-)<\/small> Anyway, I have to go finish my apology in the name of Wikipedia to [[User talk:Katjakassin]]. --
[AnonEMouse]: Now, about [[Sydnee Steele]]. That might be a different situation. Katja Kassin is pretty clearly [[User:Katjakassin]], because she says so on her myspace blog. But why do you think that Sydnee Steele is [[User:SydneeSteele]]? I admit it seems likely, but there isn't any reason it couldn't just be a fan who decided to copy the image from her web site; [[Wikipedia:Assume good faith|Assume good faith]] and all that but that doesn't mean that everyone who makes a user name after a famous porn star actually is. (One of these days I'll have to ask you where your user name came from.) And, in fact, that image could be a problem, since the [[:Image:SydneeSteeleHome.jpg]] says GFDL, but http:\/\/www.thelovegeneration.com\/ says its copyrighted. :-(. Why do you think it's really her? Did she send you email or something? I know one of my most fun moments was when I was able to exchange a few emails with [[Richard Pacheco]] after he tried to fix a few errors on the article ai was writing about him; he ended up sending me a chapter of the autobiography he was trying to publish. --
[AnonEMouse]: That's where we get back to this project not being a crusade or a genocide, just an encyclopedia. We don't change what the world thinks here, we just document it. Sorry if that's not what you thought you were signing up for, but that's what this project is about. Good luck. --
[AnonEMouse]: Yes, you may. We didn't reach any conclusion there, I mainly stopped due to fatigue relative to importance of the issue. --
[AnonEMouse]: I wish I could tell you better news. Sorry. --
[AnonEMouse]: I noticed you're writing \""free photos are unlikely to be found\"". That's not strong enough, because we're now just amazingly popular with millions of editors, some of whom are happy to go out and ''make'' free photos. You need to be a bit more specific, because in most professions, just being retired isn't a reason photos can't be made; for example, a retired politician will probably be happy to pose for a snapshot for an encyclopedia. You want to show that the person in question is actively avoiding photos, so not only are new photos unlikely to be found, they are likely impossible to make. See the \""recluse\"" bit there. I don't know what the social situation is for Japanese retired porn stars, but if you can find an article that says they tend to avoid publicity like the plague, that will be strong ammunition. --
[AnonEMouse]: Reviewed. Well done, in fact I'm surprised Giano is opposing it. \""The prose is not brilliant\""? Kind of vague without specific examples. --
[AnonEMouse]: Yup. :-(. That's the pattern, Bratz, wrestling, and now Harry Potter I see. [[Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets\/216.83.121.194]] Kind of a shame, with all that dedication, he could be adding useful stuff. --
[AnonEMouse]: You ask excellent and generally acclaimed questions on [[Wikipedia:Requests for bureaucratship]], but don't actually give opinions. (Not to mention that most people say you are the currently most active Bureaucrat, and generally like your work.) Please don't stop the questions, but could you also boil your opinions down to some supports\/opposes\/neutrals, please? Basically, out of the 8 candidates, I found one I like, one I don't like, and the other six basically seem fine, so I'd generally support - except I don't want seven new ones all at once! If you could indicate which of the flood you would find \""the best\"", and why, that would be a strong argument to me, and, I suspect, a number of other editors. --
[AnonEMouse]: Yup. --
[AnonEMouse]: Regarding your comment [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates\/Mary_Martha_Sherwood&diff=142553692&oldid=142551135 here] - I'll make you an offer. Should you be ready to submit a FAC, drop me another note on my talk page, and I will try to handle all the dashes, dates, spaces, and similar tweaks that may be asked for at the discussion. (Just don't submit more than one FAC at a time, please!) I'll view it as my own small contribution. I'm not as good with the \""brilliant prose\"" requirement as you are, but I can probably handle the mechanical bits. --
[AnonEMouse]: Sounds good. Give me a moment, I'll either find specific conflicts of interest between the two accounts or withdraw my comments. --
[AnonEMouse]: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Friedman_%28unit%29&limit=500&action=history Friedman (unit)] (Mostly User At Work, only one minor edit by The Cunctator) Neither account participated in either of [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\/Friedman (unit)]] [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\/Friedman (unit) (2nd nomination)]] All of this isn't clear cut abuse, just questionable stuff, but, frankly, that's what I hoped to find. If I had found clear cut abuse, I wouldn't be recommending a warning here, I'd be recommending outright removal of Admin status. --
[AnonEMouse]: : A less charitable soul would read that you're using two accounts to give the impression of more support on a specific controversial edit, a poster child [[WP:SOCK]] issue. --
[AnonEMouse]: # acknowledged that if it were found to be, desysopping, at the least, would be appropriate. --
[AnonEMouse]: ''(unindent)'' I'm not sure if you realize there are two issues here. One is that you're arguing with an editor who is not an administrator about a specific edit or even specific series of edits to a specific article. Eh... I'm sure that's important too, but that's not what I am primarily concerned with; no one is advocating deletion of the whole article, and I'm sure it will work out one way or another. The other is that a highly experienced user, one of maybe 100 of the most experienced users on the whole Wikipedia, an administrator, has maintained an untagged alternate account that has been used in conjunction with his main to edit quite a few rather controversial articles for over a year, while quite a few others believed it to be a completely different person. For example, look at [[User talk:Sholom]], one of the main editors of the whole Jack Abramoff chain -- he clearly thinks that User At Work and Cunctator are different people; he talks to UAW as a peer, and asks TC for advice as a mentor. While all this may not be strictly abusive in itself, it looks bad, and your admin status combined with all that history you've got makes it reflect badly on the whole project. There are specific [[WP:SOCK#Legitimate_uses_of_multiple_accounts|legitimate uses of multiple accounts]], they're mainly for segregation of edits by topic, not for editing the same article as two different identities. While I can't speak for Thatcher131, I wouldn't be surprised if he feels likewise.  --
[AnonEMouse]: Glad to help. :-) --
[AnonEMouse]: I've looked around through the history of her [[Special:DeletedContributions\/SydneeSteele]], and it looks like she kept trying to upload [[:Image:SydneeSteeleHome.jpg]] under slightly different filenames, but continuously with a \""permission to use on Wikipedia\"" license. That kept being deleted, (mostly by [[User:^demon]]) due to not being sufficient, since one of the ideas of Wikipedia is to allow its parts to be reused by others as well. But it looks like the current upload is fine - it's under a dual [[GFDL]] [[Creative Commons]] Share-Alike license, either of which would have worked, so it's even more than sufficient. I think we can add it to the article. I also think we should add http:\/\/www.thelovegeneration.com [http:\/\/www.avn.com\/articles\/267209.html AVN article] and http:\/\/myspace.com\/sydneesteele to the article.[http:\/\/www.thelovegeneration.com\/about_me.php TheLoveGeneration.com About Me page]--
[AnonEMouse]: I worked on the article a bit. :-) Want to comment on [[Talk:Sydnee Steele]] about the remaining image question? --
[AnonEMouse]: Do you want to remove the inactive template from the top of this page? --
[AnonEMouse]: Sheesh! The one candidate you express an opinion on is the one I liked? And you may just torpedo him! I feel like I wished on [[The Monkey's Paw]]... --
[AnonEMouse]: Ack! You did it! For my second wish, I want the hideously decayed animated corpse of Ral315 as a bureaucrat... --
[AnonEMouse]: In [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Robert_Benchley&curid=847111&diff=144416554&oldid=142541225 this edit] you removed [[:Image:Howtosleep.jpg]], a still from ''How to Sleep'', described in the article as Benchley's best known work, in which he was both the narrator and the actor, the one for which he won an Academy award. If that by itself isn't enough, there is a fine \""Fair use in Robert Benchley:\"" section on the image page itself. Please restore. --
[AnonEMouse]: I just noticed I'm not the only person complaining. Merging this comment as a subheading of the previous one. It has been almost half an hour since Hoary's comment, and you haven't responded. With all due respect, I'm going to revert per [[Wikipedia:Bold, revert, discuss]], and if you still believe it should be removed, ''then'' discuss on the article talk page, before removing. Thank you. --
[AnonEMouse]: That's what's being done here. No mountain. I generally ask someone before reverting their work, that's called [[WP:1RR#Explain_reverts]]. In this case it seems someone else asked already. --
[AnonEMouse]: Then maybe I misunderstood. I read that whole essay, and especially that section, with words like \""A nice thing to do is to drop the note on the Talk page first, and then revert, rather than the other way round.\"" as specifically that whinging on someone's talk page every time you disagree with an edit is actually recommended. If that is not what it means, then I guess I have been wrong; that is what I usually try to do. I like to think of it as squeaking rather than whinging, though, goes along with the Mouse motif and all. :-) --
[AnonEMouse]: Ack! The problem is that I'm not nearly a physicist, so don't know whether sentences such as \""By cosmic standards, gravity throughout the solar system is comparatively weak.\"" are as good as can be written without blowing the reader's cerebral cortex, or as vague as they read to me. On a larger (general?) scale, though no doubt simplified, the article still isn't simple. The hijackers' idea that simplified articles are bad in themselves is directly contradicted by a MOS guideline, so if it looked like the debate was coming down to that, I'd certainly say so, but it looks like there are enough people who are more comfortable with the physics saying so that I don't need to. I will try a few more times to read the article itself, so I can  actually give some intelligent evaluation or criticism at the FAC, but can't yet. Sorry. --
[AnonEMouse]: The basic idea is you want to have more content, and organize it well. Take a look at the ultimate goal, the articles in the [[Wikipedia:Featured article#Music]] section. There are a number of band articles, and this should be similar. What do [[Wikipedia:reliable sources|reliable sources]] write about the band? Look for more of that, read it, write it. Look at [[AC\/DC]] or [[Genesis (band)]] or [[Pink Floyd]] ... --
[AnonEMouse]: I don't know where that is, I'm afraid ... can you make a link to point it out? --
[AnonEMouse]: Also, I am still interested in keeping at least some kind of mention of the homosexuality bit. I understand that the books speculating about Bacon's homosexuality may not be correct, but they do exist, we need to say ''something'' about them. Perhaps we could put both that and the Shakespeare theories under a \""speculations\"" section, or add additional references to books which explicitly question their scholarship or otherwise argue with them. --
[AnonEMouse]: (The ad is a bit of a humorous overstatement; but you have got about half of those qualifications, so should do fine.) --
[AnonEMouse]: Well you know now, right? :-) Anyway, when in doubt, take things slowly, ask questions, one of the most important things to remember is that there are 1200+ other admins, so if you aren't sure, someone else ''will'' know, will be sure, and will cover for you, just ask. [[WP:AN]] and [[WP:AN\/I]] are good for general and urgent questions, but having a mentor is useful too. The first few months I had the mop I bugged [[User:Crzrussian]], I guess you can bug me. [[User:Joe Beaudoin Jr.]] is still around, and more experienced than I am, in case you want to bug him, but he's ''much'' less active, editing once a month or so. Anyway, it'll be on [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship\/Tabercil]], but give me a couple of edits at it, I'll tell you when it's ready. It's my first RFA nom. :-). --
[AnonEMouse]: Whew! You liked! I'm glad. I was kind of worried you wouldn't, actually, there are dark rumors floating around about your personal feelings towards the subject; but I just couldn't resist sourcing an article that probably would have been deleted without sourcing. Thank you, I appreciate it ... and thank you for being able to see all sides. --
[AnonEMouse]: Yeah, I saw that Jeff Stryker rating, and thought about changing, but ... well, he is probably the best known Gay male porn star. Eh. I wouldn't have marked him more than High myself, since I don't think he's really known very much outside the industry, but I won't go to war over it. Yes, I would also like to be able to find the intersection. Maybe a bot would be useful. --
[AnonEMouse]: Back to the nomination - I think it's done. You like? Anything you want me to tweak? If not, follow [[Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship\/nominate#What_to_do_if_you_are_nominated_by_someone_else]] accept, answer the questions, and add your page to the main [[WP:RFA]] page, put it on your watchlist, and stand back. One Very, Very, Very important bit of advice. You ''will'' get neutrals or even opposes, possibly because of [[WP:P*]], it's not a warm fluffy bunnies sort of area for a primary interest. When you do, take a deep breath, remember it's not the end of the world, don't take them personally, and ''if'' you choose to respond to the opposing editors, be ''brief'', be polite, don't write a lot, [[Wikipedia:assume good faith|assume good faith]], and be brief. If you write too much or too heatedly in response to an opposition it reads like you're combative, and I've seen more good admin nominations go down over just that issue than any other. Did I mention be brief? :-) --
[AnonEMouse]: Added fair use for Gorillaz, not others. --
[AnonEMouse]: All right, let's keep it at start, then. Thanks again! --
[AnonEMouse]: Honestly, I'm willing to try. It's been ''2 months'', that's not really \""the encyclopedia that anyone can edit\"". At worst, it gets vandalized, we can re-protect. But I asked on [[Talk:Ward Churchill#Unprotection? Image?]] anyway. --
[AnonEMouse]: Sorry, I don't know what the debate was about, so don't know how to recognize a revert specifically. What was the debate about? --
[AnonEMouse]: Yes, I wrote the permission on [[:Image:Charlotte Cleverley-Bisman.jpg|the image]]. I sent email to the parents on the website, and the father answered (it took a few days, I sent the email when the AFD closed).  I didn't go into the complex details about the BLP, RFAR, DRV, AFD mess, I just asked for GFDL permission to use the image, but I did specify my goal was that it would be used on our article, and included a link to our article. He gave GFDL permission to use all the images on that site, and wrote \""Thanks for your help on this.\"" So, yes, I am pretty sure he explicitly approves of having an article. Right now the article is rather short to use more than one image, but I plan to look at expanding the article further, and if it grows will probably stick in another appropriate image where it seems to fit. Feel free to help! --
[AnonEMouse]: Personal attack, BLP violation, indefinite block ... :-) --
[AnonEMouse]: Then Quadell clearly knows more since I know little. :-) I just got the \""trusted\"" thing since I noticed it's a \""speedy accept\"" for admins on other projects, and that way I could at least tag my own Flick finds. But then I tagged a few by others as well. :-) I'm sure they can always use more, if you apply, drop me a note here and I'll support you with bells on. What do you mean \""keep up with\"" my images page - you have 10 times as many! 8-O --
[AnonEMouse]: No, go ahead, I'm done for a while at least. I tried to do a merge rather than an overwrite, I'm sure it's in the edit history. Sorry! --
[AnonEMouse]: and others - why should this link be removed? It's a useful and interesting bit of article history, that a reasonably well known newspaper took the effort to take this article and get it reviewed by and experienced university professor, and that he liked it. --
[AnonEMouse]: Ah. I think I put in the date wrong in the template, I wrote June, but it was actually either April 30 or May 1. Here, let me put it back with the correct date, and an explicit note that this was a pre-FA review. --
[AnonEMouse]: Better? --
[AnonEMouse]: Thank you, thank you! But don't feel you owe me anything, you thoroughly deserved that one. --
[AnonEMouse]: [[Image:WikiThanks.png|43px|left|WikiThanks]] Thank you! That was getting to be a distraction. --
[AnonEMouse]: [[Wikipedia:Verifiability#Sources]]. It's not a list, it's the principle of editorial review, that there is, in theory, more than just one writer saying this is true, but that the writer has an editor or even a whole fact checking department going over their work and making sure the publication doesn't get sued. :-) Now in practice, we can't tell whether the editor has being doing that job, for example the ''[[New York Times]]'' is usually seen as the pinnacle of newspapers, but [[Jayson Blair]] showed that even they don't always check very much. But the point is that [[Curve (magazine)]] seems to be a real magazine, with a 6 year publishing history, real writers who sign their work, and real editors who at least in theory can check the work. This is unlike the TV.com, IMDB.com websites before, which have a reputation for printing anonymous contributions, and the other websites which don't have any editorial review. --
[AnonEMouse]: [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\/Amy Mihaljevic]]. You misread my comment. [[User:JamesRenner]], the article author, is the one who is new, so people shouldn't be harsh on him. [[User:Videmus Omnia]], the article AFD nominator, is amazing at getting excellent images released, and alienating him would be a huge loss to the Wikipedia. Let's give them each a break. --
[AnonEMouse]: That looks like a lot, but don't panic. You are not required to know everything at once, or do everything at once. One of the most important things to remember is that there are 1200 other administrators, all, by definition, more experienced than you. So if you aren't sure about something ... ''don't do it'' ... if it is really important and really needs to be done, someone else will cover for you. Again, ''if in doubt, don't''. There is usually plenty to do at the backlog categories that is useful, absolutely obvious, and not controversial. For a while, stick to that. You'll know when, and if, you feel comfortable to do the more controversial stuff -- if you never do, that's fine too, the non-controversial work is no less useful to get done. Feel free to ask questions, though - me or someone else, or WP:AN or WP:AN\/I. --
[AnonEMouse]: Oh, one of the fun things you can start with is picking the little template for the corner of your user page. It's a good idea to mark yourself as a wielder of the mop. The options are at [[Template:Administrator]]. :-) --
[AnonEMouse]: Thanks, that is useful, but wasn't quite the one I was looking for, I'm pretty sure I recall some user talk page discussion  about an early twentieth century society gentleman. But I can just wait, since as we all know, men with big penises are common on Wikipedia. [[m:GAY|\""There seems to be a proliferation of editors who have enormous equipment.\""]] :-) --
[AnonEMouse]: [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\/Amy Mihaljevic]] has a clear ''Keep'' consensus. Twice as many people are arguing for keeping instead of deleting, there are a large number of unrelated reliable sources, and it's a real stretch to bring up BLP concerns when no living people are mentioned in the article (some were before, but that was addressed). If that isn't a ''Keep'' consensus, then almost nothing is. Please change your closing. --
[AnonEMouse]: [[User:Videmus Omnia\/Requesting free content]] is a guide from someone who is better at it than I am. (I got a dozen images by asking. He got a hundred.) --
[AnonEMouse]: The important thing for Flickr is that they have to change their license to CC-BY (attribution) or CC-BY-SA (share-alike). Non-commercial or no modification or \""only for use on Wikipedia\"" don't work for us. Good luck. --
[AnonEMouse]: My personal preference is to speedy delete the article, fully protect it blank, ban the creator, AFD all articles they ever edited, use checkuser tools to find their IP address, hack into their computer, and insert a virus so that any attempt by them to even look at Wikipedia redirects them to Citizendium. You just can't be too careful. --
[AnonEMouse]: OK, I think I've covered the diff, and will copy and paste this onto the article talk page. It looks like most of the things the newer contributor is trying to put in are reasonably cited, uncontroversial, or both. Unfortunately, they're not necessarily enough for [[Wikipedia:Notability]], you'll notice I didn't weigh in either way on the AFD debate. She's a very experienced pornographic actress, but experience isn't necessarily the same as notability, though it does help. --
[AnonEMouse]: Yes, I am opposed. I don't think there is enough individual content in the article. It's basically a history of the Victoria Cross in general, and not of the Victoria Cross for New Zealand specifically. I don't believe a featured article should be basically a copy of another article. That doesn't mean it's bad, it's still an interesting story, that just means it's unoriginal. Compare, say, [[Rosa Parks]]. Someone could well have written an article that was basically the same as [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)]], that would also have been an interesting story ... but it wouldn't have been a separate, FA-worthy article. --
[AnonEMouse]: Ah, you want chapter and verse. OK, it fails [[Wikipedia:Featured article criteria]] #4, \""It is of appropriate length, staying focused on the main topic without going into unnecessary detail (see [[Wikipedia:summary style|summary style]])\"". It does not stay focused on the main topic, as over half the article is not about the Victoria Cross for New Zealand. It does not follow [[Wikipedia:summary style]], as it is a sub-article of [[Victoria Cross]], but is substantially repetitive of the main article. --
[AnonEMouse]: Possibly, but I am not that worried about the title, I'm worried about the content. I believe the content that is mostly about the Victoria Cross in general should be at most summarized here. The most dramatic example is probably the Appearance section. That starts \""The Victoria Cross for New Zealand is identical to the original design.\"" Everything beyond that one sentence is better and more appropriately covered in the [[Victoria Cross]] article, so 90% of that section should go, probably including the photograph (which is rather similar to the one in the infobox at the top of the article anyway). Applying that rule to the rest of the article won't get quite as drastic a reduction, but in general I estimate over half the article is redundant, and should be drastically reduced to be a summary of the other article to which it refers. After that reduction, I suspect it won't be a very long article. --
[AnonEMouse]: If you then re-expand it with more details on the New Zealanders who received the VC, focusing on the way they received it, that would be fine, and if it's well done I'd be happy to support. --
[AnonEMouse]: Here, I found a link for the concept we're all struggling with in ''[[Mary: A Fiction]]''. --
[AnonEMouse]: Thanks. If ''even you'' can't get them...! :-) By the way, your impressive accomplishements have inspired me quite a bit. Now I send out a new image request almost every day. <small>I know, you probably send out one every hour, but still<\/small> --
[AnonEMouse]: That's called [[meatball:DefendEachOther]]. And [[Wikipedia:Administrator|the mop]], of course. :-) --
[AnonEMouse]: His criticisms are mostly style, which could be seen as your area, so I won't if you don't approve, but there haven't been many of the technical \""wikilink all dates and remove spaces around all dashes\"" criticisms at the FAC, so I'm hardly living up to your high praise of me in the FAC lead otherwise! :-) I won't be able to answer any substance issues, but I can probably do something towards style. I'm no great hand at style on my own, but I can probably at least make some kind of compromise between your existing style and his suggestions. --
[AnonEMouse]: Thanks! Will see what I can do. --
[AnonEMouse]: Respectively: you're quite welcome, comes with [[Wikipedia:Administrator|the mop]]; you can see what I did to fix it at [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets\/Jebbrady_%282nd%29&diff=prev&oldid=151894389 this diff]; I'm not sure what you did wrong; the admins' noticeboard is a fine place to ask for help, since administrators do tend to be rather experienced users; we were all new once; if I weren't furry, I'd be blushing. :-) --
[AnonEMouse]: Lordy! Wow. I wonder if some of those could be used for other articles. And no, not the ones you think ;-) - we've got plenty of explicit photos in those articles. Instead, [[Surfboard wax]] doesn't seem to have a picture, and one from this series may well fit; [[Surfboard]] has one, but could use another. [[Skateboarding]] has plenty, unfortunately... possibly [[Skateboarding#Female skateboarders]], which doesn't have one. Some of the more explicit ones could fit under certain pornographic subgenres, but I'm not at all sure whether that's a good idea... --
[AnonEMouse]: Thank you, thank you! :-) --
[AnonEMouse]: Blocked. --
[AnonEMouse]: More seriously, look, Frightner, or whoever you are. If you make this into a continued war between yourself and Mr. Neutron, it benefits no one. You're quite right that we can't predict the next IP you will choose, so why not use the opportunity to make edits that won't be seen as part of a useless edit war? Surely there are plenty of articles in your chosen area that could use actual improvement, not just back-and-forth reversion. When you joined Wikipedia, was it really just to \""get back at\"" someone? Wasn't it to write a free encyclopedia, to write and improve articles that millions, or eventually billions, of people around the world would read, enjoy, and learn from? Please remember that, and come back to that. This isn't a chat room, this isn't a video game, it's a collaborative project to make the world just a little bit better. Please help, or at least, don't harm, that starry-eyed idea. --
[AnonEMouse]: OK. Can we pick one issue at a time and try to work through it? I haven't edited many, or possibly any, Macedonian\/Bulgarian\/Greek articles so I hope I don't have any particular point of view. Can you point to one disputed issue (article, issue, and probably a diff or two of the edit under dispute), and we'll talk it through. OK? Meanwhile, try not to make any controversial edits with this IP at least, so we'll know who you are for a while at least. I'll drop a quick note on your talk page, and in your block log, so hopefully you won't get blocked until then. :-) --
[AnonEMouse]: Yes, now your edits are being reverted on principle, but presumably the initial conflict didn't come out of nowhere, did it? I blocked that earlier string of IPs, because each made some nasty comment or blanked a user's talk page or something. What is the underlying issue we need to resolve to keep you folks from fighting? I know there are probably several, but let's pick one or two, asee if we can resolve those, then use them as a model for the others. --
[AnonEMouse]: # I see [[National Liberation War of Macedonia]] is fully protected, already not a good sign. For the Bulgarian web site, I think you're referring to [http:\/\/www.kroraina.com\/knigi\/bugarash\/mac1941\/mac41.html this], yes? We can't automatically assume that just because the site is in Bulgarian it is automatically not reliable; and reliable isn't the same thing as unbiased or true. It's quite possible with contentious issues that there will be reliable sources on each side of the issue disagreeing with each other. In a case like that, the article ends up saying \""Dr. X, from the University of XYZ, says ABC, while Professor Y, from the University of PDQ, says DEF.\"" Anyway, that site in Bulgarian, so I can't read it very well, however with the help of an online translator, I can't see support for that statement on that first page. I do, however, see that this is a site that seems to have quite a few books, or extracts from books. Here is what I see in English: [http:\/\/www.kroraina.com\/knigi\/bugarash\/bccc_1941\/Chapter1_1.html The Bulgarian population in Macedonia met with open joy the defeat of Kingdom Yugoslavia. It saw in it the end of the 23 years of enslavement. That is why it was not surprising that the Bulgarians from Vardar Macedonia, mobilizated in the Yugoslav army refuse to fight.7 Similar was the situation in the World War I when the Macedonian Bulgarians forcibly mobilized in the Serbian army in large numbers surrendered to the Austro-Hungarian army.] That's not quite the same as \""was greeted by most of the population as liberators\"", that's closer to \""was greeted by the Bulgarian portion of the population as liberators\"". That seems more reasonable. Would you have any objection to that? If you agree, we'll suggest that on the article talk page. --
[AnonEMouse]: # [[Macedonianism]] seems to be about a 4th century religious sect, surely that has nothing to do with 1941, and the edit history also doesn't show any edit war. --
[AnonEMouse]: # Finally, I suspect [[User:Mr. Neutron]] got upset with you a bit when you were doing such things as replacing his user page with a link to [[United Macedonia]]. If we can get you calmed down, then we can see if we can get him calmed down next. --
[AnonEMouse]: OK, I'll post on the article talk page. For an example of \""the right way\"" to handle controversies with reliable sources on each side, I can point to [[Macedonia (terminology)]], a [[Wikipedia:Featured article]]. You'll notice almost every paragraph describes a controversy! --
[AnonEMouse]: Now about your comment on the talk page there ... in focusing on what editor is of what ethnicity, you're commenting on contributors, not content, and I'm afraid that might stir up a firestorm again. I'm going to be ''very'' bold, and change your comment. Now that's taking a huge liberty, people really should not change others' comments, so if you at all disagree, change it back, and I won't do it again ... but I'm hoping I can keep your meaning without turning this into an ethnic debate. --
[AnonEMouse]: There is a very useful trick about the [[Wikipedia:Assume good faith|assumption of good faith]]. Even if don't actually believe the other parties are working for NPOV, or with the best interests of the encyclopedia at heart... pretend that you do. Act as if they're your best friends, your cordial colleagues. Very often, that actually makes people behave as if they did have the encyclopedia's best interests at heart. Not always, of course, but surprisingly often. It's a very useful trick. --
[AnonEMouse]: Now that the bookkeeping is done, I need to actually read the material! Hold on. --
[AnonEMouse]: Now that the bookkeeping is done, I need to actually read the material! Hold on. --
[AnonEMouse]: Thanks for discussing calmly rather than edit warring. Hang on a moment, I've been asked to weigh in on a different dispute, I'll take a look here too eventually. --
[AnonEMouse]: Changing to support. Adding a few tweaks of my own, but if you don't like them, change them back, my support doesn't depend on them. Good luck. --
[AnonEMouse]: No, thank you (all of you!). I still see some friction on the article, but I'm impressed you can focus on the successes, and mostly work things out. Well done! --
[AnonEMouse]: Folks, and by this I mean both Kwork and Renee and whoever else, please don't make this personal. This should be about [[Alice Bailey]], our article. Whether you, personally, the editors involved, are Bailey's most faithful disciples or bitterest enemies, ''shouldn't matter''. Please don't try to make this personal. Make this about the substance of the article. That's what we're here for, to write articles. This isn't a chat room, where we discuss our feelings, our personal history and our life story; we are volunteers, but we have a job, a definite end product, an encyclopedia. It's all right if we have fun doing it, if it helps us edit, we can use our talk pages to tell jokes and make merry, but if personal relations start to get in the way, they need to become impersonal. If you want to, constructively, say \""I know these critics\/followers of Bailey, so hang on a few days and I'll see if they can direct me to a really good reference, or explain why these are good and these aren't so good\"", that's great, that's using personal relationships constructively. But if you say \""you know these critics\/followers of Bailey, so you're not qualified to be an editor of this article\"", that's personal relationships getting in the way, and should stop. --

[AnonEMouse]: Back to [[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates\/Mary: A Fiction]] -  I've been dropping in every so often, and don't think there is anything waiting on me specifically to do, either to address MOS technicalities, or Tony's comments. Or is there something I'm missing since the review has gotten long? --
[AnonEMouse]: I see someone else moved the page to [[Alexander (magician)]] - good enough? There is a \""[[Help:Moving a page|move]]\"" link at the top of the page that you can use for such things, unless there is another article or redirect already at that location, you don't need to ask a [[Wikipedia:Administrator]]. --
[AnonEMouse]: Compromise is good, no argument. Since most of the Criticism section has been approved to stay, it seems some level of compromise has been achieved. No? --
[AnonEMouse]: Not a lot. I am afraid I don't think it fits that well. Yes, it's romantic, possibly the definitive work of tragic romance, but I don't think it's the specific kind of staid romance that ''Mary'' was written to criticise, nor the kind that it embodies. (Except for possibly the part about everyone dying by the end. :-) ) If you can find a picture about \""the traditional romance plot\"" or \""romantic friendships\"" or even ''Emile'', that would probably fit better. Or maybe I don't understand your purpose in adding it either. --
[AnonEMouse]: I think it meets something, yes. --
[AnonEMouse]: Fiasco? Fiasco is replacing the whole section or article with \""Fred is gay!\"" -- and even that can be easily reverted. You mean [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Alice_Bailey&diff=153755664&oldid=153753872 this]? That's minor shading differences in a few sentences, nothing to go running to an administrator over. You're all grown ups, surely you can work it out, especially if you don't spend as much effort on calling each other names. I'm not casting the article section in concrete, the way I saw it was fine but not \""perfect\"". Similarly this is roughly equivalent, and not \""perfect\"". For example, specifying that Sjoo is an advocate of the Goddess movement is probably an improvement, specifying that Gershom's essay is self-published is debatable, repetition of the word \""article\"" is clearly wrong. Some steps forward some steps back. By working on it together, you can make it better, by fighting over it you can't; but in any case please do try to see the whole thing in a bit of perspective, the exact phrasing of a few sentences in one section of one article is just not [[Wikipedia:The Most Important Thing Possible]]. Please do read that essay. --
[AnonEMouse]: I gather you two are leaning towards removal; the article doesn't really hinge on the presence of the name, and she's not Charles Manson. But I'm rather not use [[Wifey's World]] as too much of a precedent, since I'm not completely sure that was the right decision there; there were actually more sources there than just the one Arizona Republic article, arguably WW got more mainstream coverage there than from Wired, that's a worrisome thing to use as a continued precedent. I also don't want to put down anything that says that that ''Daily Orange'' article isn't a good source, since it's an absolutely excellent source for [[Lexington Steele]], it's not just his name, it's his whole life. I think the \""any humanity\"" thing should be what we're mostly considering. Do we have humanity? Not too much :-), but I think we do have some. And there is a stronger case here, since the ''[[Daily Orange]]'' article is about Lexington Steele, and only mentions Vanessa Blue in passing. The name is not that important to their article, and their article isn't that important to our article, and the article subject is complaining, we don't want to annoy people unnecessarily. But I see [[Talk:Vanessa Blue]] has a comment about the name issue from none other than [[User:Joe Beaudoin Jr.]], the first administrator \""from\"" [[WP:P*]]. I respect him highly; but it is from a year and a half ago. He's been more active just recently, let's drop him a note, see if he has changed his mind from back then. --
[AnonEMouse]: Sigh. Will read, much as I don't want to. Frankly, the article talk page is ''huge'', a hundred times the length of the actual article itself, and not very organized, keeping up with it is nearly impossible. --
[AnonEMouse]: I skimmed it. I couldn't find anyone asking to remove the whole criticism section, merely for tightening some of the language, which is fine. I found someone objecting to the \""The world 'love'\"" quote by Gershom of Bailey, and found it in ''Problems of Humanity'', Chapter IV (are you [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Alice_Bailey&diff=next&oldid=152778547 quite sure that was from ''Esoteric Healing'']?). If you see anyone removing the whole section, feel free to come to me, but even on the talk page, I don't see that. If you see that, please point me to where anyone says that. --
[AnonEMouse]: Sigh. That's not acceptable. I've given up any idea of unblocking Frightner, and will semi-protect the articles involved for a limited time, renewed as necessary if the vandalism comes back. Please drop me a note or send me an email (with diffs) if he seems to be vandalizing other articles or user pages, and I'll semi-protect those as well. (Well, the user should ask for their own user page to be protected; I see yours still are.) :-(. A shame. --
[AnonEMouse]: Seems we have agreement (re Vanessa Blue, not Washingtonienne!). This should, of course, be discussed on the article talk page, not here on my talk page. :-) I removed it from the article, left a comment to see the talk page, and added most of our conversation from here to the talk page. That's [[Talk:Vanessa_Blue#Real_name.2C_redux]]. By the way, Videmus Omnia, when you tell her we removed it, we should specify, that we're not doing this ''because'' of the promise of her help with our article... but we certainly ''appreciate'' any help with our article! :-) --
[AnonEMouse]: And about Cutler ... I suspect I would be a bit less charitable, in other words keep the image. We can make exceptions in the name of humanity where it seems like an ex-boyfriend let a name slip in an interview, we can replace worse photos with better ones (as you've done in quite a few articles, thanks!), but we can't make article subjects take out perfectly reasonable free photos with no replacement just because they don't like them. --
[AnonEMouse]: By the way, I didn't lock the article, because I don't see any signs that there will be an issue with anyone rushing to put it back. The only one who commented on the talk page about it being removed, was, well, Joe B., and we just got agreement from him here. In general my belief is that the fewer admin tools are used, the better. <small>(wrote the mouse after semi-protecting half a dozen pages in a different dispute.... sigh...)<\/small> --
[AnonEMouse]: No, all I know about that is what I get from skimming the talk page, and, frankly, as per my recommendation to focus on the article, not the editors, I haven't been paying much attention to it. But since you ask, let's look into the details. According to the [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=protect&user=&page=Alice+Bailey article protection log] Alice Bailey was semi-protected on Aug 22 by [[User:Kylu]], with the comment that this is per request on [[WP:AN\/I]] thread. That seems to be in reference to [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard\/IncidentArchive288#Alice Bailey Board]] ... yes, there it is, a comment from Kylu stating she is semi-protecting the article ... and an unsigned comment (possibly from the editor without a user name?) thanking her from that, that's interesting. For what it's worth, the semi-protection expires tomorrow. --
[AnonEMouse]: Yes. [[Wikipedia:Protection policy]] describes it. If you believe (or can reasonably guarantee) that she will be constructive, and there isn't a particular threat of vandalism, I can unprotect the page so she can edit from her IP. --
[AnonEMouse]: That doesn't sound like a ringing endorsement - maybe we should let the protection run then. Fair warning, when it runs out, if there is continued vandalism or edit warring rather than discussion, I'll protect it too. Much as I don't like huge posts on the talk page, better that than disrupting the article itself. --
[AnonEMouse]: --
[AnonEMouse]: By the way, you don't seem to be our friend from Perth, who seems to have been responsible for most of the above. Please do consider getting a user account, then you won't be confused with other IP users like the above mentioned vandal, after a few days you will be able to edit Mr. Neutron's talk page, and other benefits. --
[AnonEMouse]: There is a lot to be said for getting a user account, no argument. --
[AnonEMouse]: Sethie is basically right. [[Wikipedia:User page#How do I delete my user and user talk pages?]] covers asking for deletion of user pages; removing personal information is a perfectly good reason to do that. If she wants to be conscientious and yet anonymous, she can avoid editing with the old account, and if some time has passed, she should be fine. If she still wants to continue editing with the old account she can just avoid editing any pages with both accounts, she can check the edit history if she isn't sure. --
[AnonEMouse]: Ah, the friend from Perth. Frightner, I don't know what you are referring to, and, frankly, not tremendously interested. I'm quite disappointed in what you did over the weekend. I thought you yourself wrote we were getting somewhere. --
[AnonEMouse]: Sethie is basically right that getting a user account and signing posts are both good things; my post goes on to give details. Protection of an article isn't \""punishment\"", admin tools aren't for \""punishment\"", they're for protection of the encyclopedia. I didn't unprotect the article because that would be basically taking the responsibility that the IP's edits to the article would be constructive; I was not willing to override Kylu's judgment without research, and since even you, who are better acquainted with the IP than I am, were not willing to vouch for her. In any case, that semi-protection has now lapsed, though can be reinstated if needed. --
[AnonEMouse]: Please re-read the last sentence of my previous reply. I hate to sound frustrated, but there seems to be a pattern of your missing rather important parts of my comments. --
[AnonEMouse]: Any article can be protected at any time; in an encyclopedia where at any moment a bored ten year old can decide to replace an article with poopy jokes, that's a given. (See [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Bulgaria&diff=prev&oldid=153967669 here] for a recent example from yet another conflict I was being nurse maid on, higher up on this very page.) You don't have to do anything, it's a volunteer project. <s>Finally, you're close to [[Godwin's Law]]; invoking murder in an editing dispute is a disservice to the dead, please don't.<\/s> --
[AnonEMouse]: Sorry, but I think we are going off on a tangent. This isn't a chat forum dedicated to exploring either your or my personal views and opinions, this is a page dedicated to editing the Wikipedia. Based on that, I'll withdraw the Godwin's law statement if that will make it easier. If you have a specific request for something for me to do directly relevant to an encyclopedia article, please ask. --
[AnonEMouse]: You're welcome, great to hear it! --
[AnonEMouse]: Will do. --
[AnonEMouse]: [[Talk:Alice_Bailey#Links]]? Will look. --
[AnonEMouse]: It was probably deleted because all it said was <blockquote>This is a new article, and material will be added in the next few days. Please do not delete. [[User:Kwork|Kwork]] 22:02, 30 August 2007 (UTC)<\/blockquote> Wikipedia articles in the main space are usually \""under construction\"", but they should at all stages actually have ''something'' about their purported subject. If you just want a scratch workspace to put down random thoughts, feel free to make a page in your user space, for example [[User:Kwork\/Occultism and Antisemitism]] but don't put it in the main space until it's at least a few sentences actually about Occultism and Antisemitism, hopefully with at least one link to a source. --
[AnonEMouse]: As for 4), you're using a pseudonym right now, you're signing yourself Nameless Date Stamp, aren't you? Doing that from an IP is no more anonymous than doing so from a user account. Trust me, no one thinks AnonEMouse is something my mother named me either. The only difference between editing as an IP and editing as an account is that neither you nor anyone who wants to deal with you gets any of the other advantages -- an edit history, a talk page that will stay the same when you change service providers or whether you're editing from your home or an airport, after 5 days, the ability to edit semi-protected pages, others -- that an actual account would bring. By the way, Nameless Date Stamp would be a perfectly fine user name, I don't see a [[User:Nameless Date Stamp]] right now. Grab it before someone else does (and causes more confusion! :-)), please. --
[AnonEMouse]: By the way, we have all kinds of people here at the Wikipedia. Some are cruel, and some aren't. If you need an additional shoulder to cry on, let me direct you to the legendary [[User:Phaedriel]], who has been said to have the ability to cheer up a rock. I'll do my best to help, but she's far better. --
[AnonEMouse]: Ah, there's another good thing about having user accounts, the ability to create new articles! Nameless (nameless!), please do. It's easy and fun. :-) You even get a user page you [[User:AnonEMouse|can put (free) pictures of mice on]]. :-) --
[AnonEMouse]: Yes, absolutely, thanks! Though I'm slightly bothered by the star in the background being rusty... :-) --
[AnonEMouse]: Ho! Thanks, that's nice! --
[AnonEMouse]: So out of those there are no obvious deletes, and a number of obvious keeps. I'm actually rather surprised, I know that even a half-hearted effort to find deletion-worthy candidates in other pornography fields generally finds some. Are there others you're concerned about? --
[AnonEMouse]: It looks like you've found [[Help:Archiving a talk page]] already. I only see 1 RfC, the one at [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment\/Religion and philosophy]] - but of course with that talk page, I wouldn't be surprised if you told me that I missed an animated picture of a dancing elephant halfway down the page. The RFC has basically been answered, I think, so we should probably close it. There's certainly a related debate, but the issues are at least somewhat different now. What's the other RFC, please? I think we need to [[wp:bold|be bold]] in archiving, unfortunately, just pick a point that may have to be relatively arbitrary, and archive everything before then, otherwise the talk page is too long to be readable. --
[AnonEMouse]: It looks like a chat forum. Participation in a chat forum does not qualify her as \""an established expert on the topic of the article whose work in the relevant field has previously been published by reliable third-party publications\"". That's the standard that needs to be met, from [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources]]. --
[AnonEMouse]: Thanks. The point is to focus on the content of the article. Arguing about an editor's personal affiliations is, even at best, not helping the article. --
[AnonEMouse]: No, not really. There are harsh measures that can be taken if the article is being edited disruptively, or if editors are being outright rude to each other, but we can't force intelligent adults to either change their minds or stop arguing.  We can only keep trying by persuasion. It does usually work, but one of the reasons it usually works is that people get tired. :-). See [[Wikipedia:Consensus]]. However the way to make it go faster is to emphasize the positive, work forward from the things that have been agreed on, and avoid personal attacks. There are whole books on this sort of thing, one of the most famous is called ''[[Getting to Yes]]''.--
[AnonEMouse]: One more very important thing to remember: keeping this in perspective. If you ever feel you are getting ulcers from this, stop, and work on [[fairy tales]] or [[chocolate ice cream]] or something filled with sweetness and light, until you can come back with a lighter spirit. There are half a dozen editors working on Alice Bailey now, it will go on fine without any specific one of us. This is one section in one Start-class article among 2 million articles. Read some [[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates]] - they have some really good writing. Don't sweat the small stuff. --
[AnonEMouse]: [[Camp David Accords|No results]]? We're also in a noticeably better situation than the Arab-Israeli conflict, for at least one reason because we do have admin tools if the disagreement turns into a firefight. The fact that the article is not [[wikipedia:protected|protected]] is at least a partial positive result; people are disagreeing, but civilly. If it gets uncivil, and people start editing without talking to each other, that will be worse ... then the article will be protected until it gets better. --
[AnonEMouse]: Thanks. I understand. You are all well meaning editors. If only you believed that about each other. :-) --
[AnonEMouse]: I'm also semi-protecting the [[Nikola Karev]] article for a while to keep it from further edit warring from other Perth-based IPs. If he continues to be nasty (not just discussing, but attacking) on the talk page, post here, and I'll semi-protect it as well. --
[AnonEMouse]: You closed [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\/J. Kevin Tumlinson]] after one day without mentioning anything about speedy deletion or giving reasons. Not that I'm objecting ''too'' much, but did you realize it was only one day? --
[AnonEMouse]: No, no, I was the nominator! Just wanted to make sure it wasn't done in error. --
[AnonEMouse]: Yes and no. No, blocking your IPs has been shown to be ineffective. But I can and will semi-protect pages on which you engage in edit warring or personal attacks, and posting a link to your IP edit history helps me find those. Please be civil. You had a few days when you were really trying to be civil, and I stood up for you. Now it looks like you're not even trying any more. --
[AnonEMouse]: if you really suspect company involvement, see if the [[WikiScanner]] will help. I've not used it yet, but this is what it is supposed to be for. --
[AnonEMouse]: You mean for [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=List_of_Macedonians_%28ethnic_group%29&diff=156945601&oldid=156925837 this edit]? Eh.... look. Technically he should not edit war, absolutely. Unfortunately, in that particular edit, I agree with him. Just following the link to [[Ancient Macedonians]] says whether or not they were Greek is debated, so it's far clearer to just say that this link goes to \""the people of Ancient Macedonia\"", not \""the Greek people of Ancient Macedonia\"", the latter implies that we have a different article on the non-Greek people. We don't need the adjective, if we can make a clear link without it. So if you like, I can semi-protect the article ... but then I'd have to take over the edit conflict for him. :-). --
[AnonEMouse]: Thanks. I understand that there is a lot of controversy here, even between respected scholars. We need to document that disagreement in our articles, hopefully without attacking editors. --
[AnonEMouse]: I looked at it some more, there's room for compromise. It looks like, as the IP writes (by the way, 24... and 209... come from the same city in Alabama, so I suspect they're the same person), that BO is a rare disease caused when something damages your lungs. The diacetyl flavoring in fake-butter popcorn is just one of the possibilities for those somethings, that happens to have gotten some press lately; however someone suffering from BO from transplant rejection (as, say, [http:\/\/path.upmc.edu\/divisions\/pulmpath\/bron02.htm this article from University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, as best I can tell]) would be greatly surprised to be told they have Popcorn Worker's Lung. So while we should certainly document all the diacetyl and popcorn stuff, but we shouldn't say they're synonyms, we should say that PWL is a specific form of BO. If it looks like PWL is overweighing the article, we create a new article on PWL, and leave a summary section in BO. That's called [[Wikipedia:Summary style]]. But right now it does not seem to be overweighing the article, being less than a quarter of the total article length. Want me to write that on the article talk page, or do you think you have worked it out there? --
[AnonEMouse]: [[User:ManualRivera791]] was the proud author, but it's a common enough insert-name-here name, just [http:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=Joe+Schmidlap ask Google]. Joe Schmoe is another; John Q. Public; John Doe in legal cases; Joe Bloggs on standardized tests; Bubba... --
[AnonEMouse]: As an editing rule here, it's better to add to people's edits, rephrase, rearrange, etc., rather than remove their changes wholesale. That way there is some back and forth, but in general a kind of incremental progress, and the article improves. Just reverting leads to deadlock, and should be avoided. Don't insist on perfection all at once. When you find something wrong, fix it, but don't just delete it unless there really is no other choice. --
[AnonEMouse]: [[UFO]] being an edit war in progress... well, yeah, what did you expect? :-)  I can similarly, even without looking, tell you that [[Iraq War]], [[George W. Bush]], [[Abortion]], and [[Scientology]] aren't going to be the most calm and peaceful articles either. It's the nature of the subject. I looked at it, and it wasn't actually as bad as it could have been, it has lots of information and references, and nice pictures, a few {{tl|fact}} tags are not so bad. Linking to UFO Phil wouldn't be too appropriate if the [[UFO#See also]] section only had two or even five links, since he's fairly minor, but since it has fifty (!), he fits fine. And no, having 50 See also links is ''not'' the best idea, when you get to that level, that's what [[Wikipedia:Categorization|Categories]] are for... but there are two million articles on the Wikipedia, and this is not nearly as bad as some; we have to choose our battles. If you want to go in and improve it, good luck, but don't expect it to be calm. --
[AnonEMouse]: You can't access the email address, you can just send email through a web page form. Left hand side, \""toolbox\"" box, \""E-mail this user\"" link. If either of you don't have email set when you click on it, you won't even get a form to fill in. --
[AnonEMouse]: It shouldn't. Can you find the link? It should turn into something like http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Special:Emailuser\/AnonEMouse What happens when you click on it? --
[AnonEMouse]: You have the right idea; we certainly want confirmation before accusing someone of being an escort, which is usually a euphemism for being a prostitute. However, in this case, he's apparently a prizewinning escort. (Yes, I didn't know there was a prize for that either, but it seems there is ... live and learn. I'll be making an article for the [[International Escort Awards]] soon; it got coverage from the ''[[Village Voice]]'', ''[[DNA Magazine]]'', and even a bit from the ''[[New York Daily News]]''.) Winning the prize is fairly clear confirmation that he does work as an escort. --
[AnonEMouse]: I received your 2 emails. I'm not sure I understood the second, but if it's taken care of, that's good too. :-) --
[AnonEMouse]: Don't worry about it. I doubt many email harvesters will go digging in page histories, and don't know of any downstream sites that copy our histories, just our pages. Removing it from the page should be sufficient. --
[AnonEMouse]: They would be [[Wikipedia:blocking policy|blocked]], yes, but it looks like they haven't been repeating. [[IP address]]es are usually not [[Wikipedia:Banning policy|banned]], because an IP is usually just a number handed out by a service provider, and will be given to a different person  eventually; certainly when the person signs up with a new service provider, and sometimes even faster than that. Our acquaintaince from Perth editing on that subject has shown the ability to get a new IP number within minutes of the old one being blocked, sometimes several times a day; fortunately, however, this isn't him. --
[AnonEMouse]: I see a similar address made a similar comment. [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Talk:Republic_of_Macedonia&diff=157578888&oldid=157499660] If it becomes a regular thing, tell me, and I will semi-protect the article talk page. That will stop all IP addresses without an account from editing there (apparently some do make non-abusive comments[http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Talk:Republic_of_Macedonia&diff=156689101&oldid=156496906]) but if we have to, we will. --
[AnonEMouse]: Thanks for finding that. Oh, I remember Chidom. He came in when [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Pornography]] was sadly lacking a dedicated gay pornography editor, and did a very good job for a while. If it's an issue of editor creditability, that should be good enough; but I don't know it it is, we may well need the full email with headers, etc., archived at OTRS. --
[AnonEMouse]: Aaah. Hold on a bit, let me dig ... --
[AnonEMouse]: He [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=renameuser&user=&page=User%3AChidom changed his username], then two days later [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Secretlondon&diff=prev&oldid=126603298 exercised his right to vanish entirely]. --
[AnonEMouse]: I had an email address for him once, but he hasn't responded for a while. I'll send him a note about it, but can't guarantee anything. --
[AnonEMouse]: I'd wait. I'm willing to believe Chidom actually got the permission email he wote he did, partly because of [[Wikipedia:Assume good faith]], but mostly because he really was a dedicated editor. He may have already forwarded it to permissions at wikimedia dot org the same way most of the other emails on that page Videmus Omnia found were forwarded. If he didn't, he may still have it around, and may respond to my email to forward it there now, so we can get an OTRS ticket number that way. If not, HisXPress is likely to confirm giving the permission, and we can forward that to OTRS. Between all those possibilities, I think it most likely the image permission is fine, let's give it a couple of weeks. --
[AnonEMouse]: Take a look at [[User:AnonEMouse\/MouSearch]]. I made a [[Google Co-op]] customized [[search engine]] to help searching for sources as opposed to endless image galleries and  forums. Maybe that will help somewhat. It doesn't include as many gay sources as it might, mostly because I don't know as much about that area, but there is no reason that can't be improved. --
[AnonEMouse]: Sorry, I'm not ignoring you, it's just that you deserve a good answer that is proving hard to write. Please believe that I appreciate many of your contributions. If you want, you can read or re-read most of [[User_talk:AnonEMouse\/Archive_9]], where the earlier incidents came up - I think a third of that archive is directly or indirectly comments about you. :-) I'll write more here soon. --
[AnonEMouse]: That's the first three, if they're representative, I see the pattern. In general the sources are fine. Some can be improved, but it shouldn't be hard, I found the BDM with a basic search. May I suggest working together with him to improve the sources? --
[AnonEMouse]: Anyway, that's the general answer. The specific answer, I guess, is to nominate fewer \""bunches\"", when you can, try to improve them rather than delete them, and be nicer to people in general. Sorry for being incoherent, hope that helped a bit. -
[AnonEMouse]: It can't, without [[Wikipedia:Oversight]] or some intensive work deleting specific revisions by an admin. Or at least I've never seen it happen, and I've been looking at page histories a long time. What specific comments are you referring to, please? --
[AnonEMouse]: --
[AnonEMouse]: You mean [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Alice_Bailey&diff=157851672&oldid=157755144 this section]? I agree with the critics, whether the issue is original research or undue weight. The main problem is that this is the Alice Bailey article, and the section isn't about Alice Bailey, it's about [[Channeling]] in general. We have a whole article on that (it seems to be called [[Mediumship]]), and that section would be better directed there. We can't put a long section critical of channeling in general in the article on every mystic, any more than we can put a long section critical of warfare in general in every article on a general, or a long section critical of abortion in general in every article on a feminist.--
[AnonEMouse]: Chidom replied; apparently hisxpress sent the permission to wikimedia directly, so they didn't send the number to Chidom, and he didn't know he was supposed to get a number. I wrote to permissions-en at wikimedia.org, and they wrote \""The correspondence was indeed forwarded to us, under ticket number 2006072610000589.\"" They also wrote \""Please note that while the images are hosted on the hisxpress.com site, they may not be the actual copyright holders of all the works, and therefore may not be in a position to license the images further. It would be best if you could review each image on a case by case basis to determine the actual copyright holder and the validity of the GFDL licensing in this permission, instead of applying a boilerplate template to all of them.\"" I'm not quite sure what that is supposed to mean. If the site claims they own the image, in general we need to take their word for it, unless we have evidence or at least claims to the contrary. But maybe it will become obvious if we look at some of the images and they have watermarks that say they are owned by someone other than HisXPress. I haven't looked at any beyond the Arpad Miklos image. --
[AnonEMouse]: I looked at {{tl|OTRS ticket}} and it seems to need some sort of ticket id, as well as the ticket number. I asked permissions for that, and for clarification on how we are to determine \""actual copyright holder\"" other than HisXPress. Let's see what they have to say. --
[AnonEMouse]: Did that, also added the OTRS number and info to the Successful requests for permission post. --
[AnonEMouse]: I reverted my [[WP:P*]] note, and probably need to add clarification to the Successful requests. In a way, I'm glad Chidom isn't here any more, he would probably be tearing his hair out. :-(. --
[AnonEMouse]: The good news for this particular image is that we have an editor claiming to be in touch with the article subject himself, so we can ask him if he would be willing to release a free image (hopefully clothed!). But it's pretty bad news for the other articles using HisXPress images. :-(. --
[AnonEMouse]: Whoo. Tall order - check all 77 references? I checked three above, the first two were OK, the third could be improved, but wasn't absolutely horrible. Tell you what; ask me about the ones that you feel least certain about, and I'll try to help, but man, 77 is a lot. --
[AnonEMouse]: Oh, I'm not an expert, but in my feeble memory, lots of religions' prophets describe or are described as being possessed by the Holy Spirit, being in a trance, speaking in tongues, being visited by spirits, all of that stuff. Also, it doesn't seem the article focuses on channeling per se, rather the fruits thereof. It doesn't recommend that people go out and become channelers. It also mentions Bailey's suicide attempts, similarly we shouldn't stick in a whole section on how bad suicide is for you.--
[AnonEMouse]: Heh, don't worry. I gather you just don't know about NYB yet. Brad is, for good reason, one of the most popular admins we have. You can see him on the short list at [[WP:200#Requests_for_adminship]], but will have to look further to see that he not only had over 200 supports, but fewer opposes than anyone else on that list. He's a deep and careful thinker, and has never been known to write a word in anger, even though he does get involved in important and sometimes heated issues. --
[AnonEMouse]: The links are there, they're just small, at the beginning of the refs. The change seems to have been made [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Alice_Bailey&diff=next&oldid=156134293 September 6, by Catherine]. I think it was done by mistake; Cat was trying to standardize ref style, and tripped. Let's see if I can fix it. --
[AnonEMouse]: I think [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Alice_Bailey&diff=158557117&oldid=158538262 that] was what Catherine wanted to do - if it wasn't, please correct further. However, I'm not sure why '''Charges of ...''' is its own section. It seems that '''Criticisms''', '''Controversies''' and '''Charges''' are rather related sorts of sections, and should be subsections of a common section. No? --
[AnonEMouse]: It looks like there won't be any double redirects, so you won't have to change any other pages. Good luck. --
[AnonEMouse]: Oh, and for the rename, that probably needs to be listed at [[Wikipedia:Categories for discussion]] for the classic 5 days. That page describes what you need to do. It probably won't be controversial, but it is a category with a fair number of entries, let's cross the ts and dot the is. --
[AnonEMouse]: I'm also not sure what your goal is in adding extra opinions. We've gotten off the main problem, where, for a long time, people were just fighting over one small section unproductively. Now the article is growing, that's all that can be asked for, that's the goal. If I saw it before me at [[Wikipedia:WikiProject_Biography\/Assessment]], I'd upgrade it from Start-class to B-class without difficulty. It will never be perfect, there will always be tweaks that can be made, but we're (or, rather, since I'm not doing much, you're) getting it better and better. --
[AnonEMouse]: Remember our goal is to get a great encyclopedia, and that's one made up of great articles. A great article in this case isn't one that either builds Bailey up or tears her down, a great article is one that covers all aspects of a no doubt complex story (all humans are complex) and is pleasant and interesting to read. --
[AnonEMouse]: Whoah, whoah, whoah. I don't know what caused this, but calling someone names like that is not \""not backing down\"", it's a personal attack. (Fortunately no one here claims to be Lindsay.) Please calm down and be specific what the issue is. --
[AnonEMouse]: I admit I'm not really sure what you're talking about, maybe you could be more clear what the problem is? On the article talk page, I see [[Talk:Alice_Bailey#Isnt_Phillip_Lindsay_the_real_reaon._.3F]] which refers to a Yahoo group, in which Lindsay makes a post complaining about the Wikipedia article back in February. http:\/\/groups.yahoo.com\/group\/EsotericWisdomTeachings\/message\/72 I don't see any other reference to Wikipedia in that Yahoo group. Is this what you mean? If so, well, I can imagine it might have caused someone to edit the article, but if you're talking about James, his first edit was in May, so I doubt that  could have been the direct cause. Anyway, the reason why people showed up could be anything, the important thing is what people do when they get here. And this \""control\"" thing - no one person controls much of anything here. Not even Jimbo. I've got a few extra shiny buttons, but you'll notice I do my best to avoid using them, when I can use words instead. This isn't a battleground, this is a bunch of volunteers trying to write articles together. --
[AnonEMouse]: It's worse than help or not help, I'm not sure Phillip Lindsay (Philip? One l or two?) meets our [[Wikipedia:Notability (people)]] criteria for articles. Read that, but basically multiple unrelated reliable sources need to have written non-trivial articles about him. There are other possibilities (winning a notable award), but non-trivial coverage is the main one. That means several works written about him, and not by him and not by his brother in law, and not phonebook-style coverage. Looking through that Google search I can't find those - I can find lots of mentions, but they're mostly by him, not about him. --
[AnonEMouse]: Wow. From you that means a lot; [[User:AnonEMouse\/Images|my entire output]] is a slow month for you. :-) I also didn't put claw to camera myself, just did a lot of searching for other people's hard work. Thank you! --
[AnonEMouse]: Thank you, thank you! I hope I can live up to that high praise. --
[AnonEMouse]: Watchlisted. We also need to watch [[Cooper City High School]]. Fortunately, Picguy10133 hasn't edited that article since June, and anything since August. The article also desperately needs cleanup, we can't list every magazine appearance - however, that wouldn't leave much. Google searching on \""Lilly Ann\"" has the obvious problem that it's a fairly common name. --
[AnonEMouse]: The archive only contains the final text, not each diff; the diffs are in the history of the talk page itself. [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Talk:Alice_Bailey&limit=1000&action=history] Another thing to note is that the timestamps on the posts may be off a bit from the timestamp on the diff, something to do with [[time zones]], I imagine. Good luck! --
[AnonEMouse]: Thank you. Watchlisted. --
[AnonEMouse]: After all, we do need something. --
[AnonEMouse]: I like most of [[Wikipedia_talk:Linking_to_external_harassment#Newyorkbrad.27s_proposal_from_the_ArbCom_case|Newyorkbrad's proposal]], and think it can get wide support. It was removed as proposing a policy, which Arbcom doesn't do, but Alecmconroy did a good job of [[Wikipedia_talk:Linking_to_external_harassment#How_to_build_the_original_New_York_Brad_proposal_using_things_found_around_the_project |showing how much of it can be justified by existing policy]], which Arbcom certainly does do. Please take a look, and see how much of that you can snarf. (Erm, sorry. You're a mathematician. [http:\/\/www.guntheranderson.com\/v\/data\/lobachev.htm \""... be sure always to call it please, 'research'.\""] :-)) --
[AnonEMouse]: I think we can't and shouldn't make a specific ''never'' rule, because it depends on the notability of the site, which can change. There certainly are sites, like the canonical one, we should never link to ''now''; but that is fortunately because it is not notable enough. We do link to [[Wikipedia Watch]], which is pretty clearly an attack site, however has gotten substantial press. (And has been the result of the poorly thought out [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\/Daniel Brandt (14th nomination)|Daniel Brandt deletion]], but spilt milk.) Should the canonical site get non-trivial coverage by multiple reliable sources, we'll link to it. We'll interpret [[Wikipedia:Notability]] as strictly as we can, of course, we aren't masochists, but we are an encyclopedia first, and a community only second. But we shouldn't say that in this official decision, because ... [[WP:BEANS]] if nothing else. Nyb's proposal describing that we shouldn't link to attack pages, and should discourage linking to attack sites (though it doesn't quite use those words, since he's smarter than I am), does cover both those cases sufficiently. As I complained, it doesn't completely cover the notable-site-with-front-page-attack case, but I don't have any good ideas for that myself. The perfect is the enemy of the good, and Nyb's proposal is a lot better than nothing. <small>By the way, I keep having thoughts of drafting Nyb for arbcom half a year early; or at least blocking anyone who opposes his nomination at the proper time as a blatant vandal... :-)<\/small>--
[AnonEMouse]: You can: the similarities are large, the contention has been going on for a long time, and the last edits should be recent enough. However, is it really going to help much? Neither {{user|Mobile 01}} nor {{user|203.49.235.50}} is very active, the last fight either was in seems to have been weeks ago. --
[AnonEMouse]: I don't like most of it, and I said as much on the attached talk page, which is generally considered the place to discuss changes to the page. --
[AnonEMouse]: You can send email to either myself or Joe (we're both [[Wikipedia:Administrator]]s) through the links at the left; but usually Wiki posting is considered better, as it leaves a record of the discussion that others can read too. When you write that you are a member of the site, does that mean you are working for the site, or you paid for membership? --
[AnonEMouse]: I don't know, from external evidence (it's a large site, somewhat ad-laden, but clearly not a porn site, apparently focused on economic issues in general) it seemed like it could be a reliable source, but I will defer either way to someone who does read Italian or otherwise claims they know better. That's what I wrote in the AFD, and that's why I'm not taking it to DRV, or even objecting to the close as such. I was commenting on Epbr123's comment, and wondering if you do claim you (yu) do know better, mainly out of curiousity, and for the next time Economia Aziende writes an article on something. So, do you read Italian or otherwise have any reason to know whether or not they're just a random site, or something more notable or reliable? --
[AnonEMouse]: B it is, a few more comments on the [[Talk:Mo_Foster#Assessment]] section. --
[AnonEMouse]: <small>and you seem somewhat less likely to block me indefinitely for suggesting than a few other arbcommers. :-)<\/small>--
[AnonEMouse]: That specific section of WP:BLP contains wonderful language, such as \""Real people are involved, and they can be hurt by your words.\"" and \""do no harm\"" and \""including every detail can lead to problems, even when the material is well-sourced\"". Incorporating all that by reference is exactly what we want. --
[AnonEMouse]: Either here or on your talk page is fine; I read it there too. No problem, sometimes our policies can be complicated, no one can be expected to know everything at once. Good luck! :-) --
[AnonEMouse]: [[Image:WikiThanks.png|43px|left|WikiThanks]]! --
[AnonEMouse]: # Finally you changed the official myspace link from http:\/\/myspace.com\/nikkinova to http:\/\/myspace.com\/nikkinovarocks Why? There are several sites that claim the first one is the official myspace, including aceshowbiz.com\/celebrity\/nikki_nova\/, http:\/\/www.nikkisblog.com\/, and none for the other one.  --
[AnonEMouse]: See just above. I'm not sure why they chose me, I don't think I'm an active sociology editor. Maybe because my username starts with A? About that template - well - maybe it's just the timid mouse point of view, but, yes, I have to admit, the huge box with about 50 or so links did look just a bit imposing to me, yes. I've been an admin for about a year, and I don't think ''I've'' read all those pages! :-) --
[AnonEMouse]: All right, I'll make the requests. From my experience it takes a couple of days to make the request and get the response, so assuming the second person I ask says yes, we should have a new image in a week or so. For the other thing you mean this: [[Wikipedia:Good_article_reassessment#Hispanic_Admirals_in_the_United_States_Navy]]? Let me look, we can't have a FA writer getting discouraged enough to leave just like that! :-)--
[AnonEMouse]: I was just thinking this very morning - wow, nothing heard from Alice Bailey in quite some time, maybe they've reached some kind of stability? Ah, well. Will look... --
[AnonEMouse]: Looking good for the image - the owner of http:\/\/flickr.com\/photos\/telstar\/47854252\/ says he is a registered Wikipedian himself and will be glad to add the picture to the article himself later today. Maybe even two pictures if we're lucky. That's the first time that happened to me, that I met someone who says \""sure, but why don't I do it myself\"". :-) --
[AnonEMouse]: As for the Good article reassessment, that seems to be bobbing and weaving, I'm not sure what the focus of the objection is. At first it seems like it was that there is no such thing as a Hispanic which is ridiculous. Then it seems like it was that the intersection of Hispanic and Admiral isn't notable, which is only marginally less silly. Then it seems the issue was with sourcing, which I could do something about (I added a specific link to the New York Times 1911 article) but then I read it again, and it seems the issue was that this is a list and not an article, and I don't know much about lists. I think the whole reassessment should be restarted until the objectors become clear on their complaints. I'll go say that there. --
[AnonEMouse]: I personally have used the Internet Archive for such things. However [[Web archiving]] lists several others. One I've always wanted to try \""when I get a round to it\"" has been [[WebCite]], which apparently will archive any link for you when you ask them to. Or at least will for academic sources; and I think Wikipedia can try to be called that. :-). Unfortunately it requires being proactive, and asking them to archive the page ''before'' it vanishes, not after. Something about barn doors and horses... :-( If you try any of those, please tell me how they have worked for you. The good news is that the ''Mainichi Shimbun'' is a print newspaper, so if you cited the date the article appeared in print, the reference is still valid even if you can't find it on the Web. But of course it is much more convenient for everyone if you do have a link. --
[AnonEMouse]: Will try, let me think about how best to phrase it. I think Awadewit likes me, but in a way that makes this more difficult. If it was someone else, I could just say, look, [[WP:ENGVAR]] is a commonly accepted guideline, and it clearly doesn't make the article any worse, so while we can't make you do it, at least don't stop someone else from doing it, and they'd look at the little mop on my user page and probably behave. Maybe that will be the way to go, but I hope I can write it at least a little more nicely. --
[AnonEMouse]: Oh my. I wish I could tell you better news, but the birthdate is the least of your worries. The article is somewhat controversial, about a probably living person, and basically unsourced. Porn stars are controversial by their nature, but due to her specialty, this one seems to be more controversial than some. There is a strong argument in [[Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons]] that all unsourced derogatory or controversial information about living persons should be deleted outright; this whole article isn't obviously at that level, but it isn't that far from it. I looked a while on the web, and I couldn't find any [[Wikipedia:reliable sources]] writing about her, or even backing Alkivar's claim from [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\/Tove Jensen]], which seems to be why it wasn't deleted then. There are lots of image galleries, but that doesn't mean much; the ones who want to publish actual information about here refer ... to our article! I've looked at the PDFs referenced from the article talk page, and they aren't conclusive proof of anything, and even if they were, they would probably be primary sources. :-( The article isn't slanderous, but I strongly doubt it could stand up to another deletion challenge, which makes the question of age rather moot. --
[AnonEMouse]: Sorry it wasn't fun. Thank you for your contributions, I think the good ones will stay longer than you think. Nice quote there at the end, a very good idea. --
[AnonEMouse]: [[Talk:Alice Bailey]] still seems to be consistently B-Class, I don't see any change. I also took a quick glance at Parsifal's edits there, and couldn't see what you are referring to, though, of course, there were many, so I probably missed it. A [[wp:diff|diff]], perhaps? --
[AnonEMouse]: Calm, calm, please. It's been a contentious situation, I can well believe it's not fun for some. --
[AnonEMouse]: Heh, you have clashed with him, haven't you? VO's block log would have been a better argument against Ryulong, yes: two consecutive blocks, each ending in an apology for mistaken identity or mistaken time stamps, is not good. But I stand by the comment about Ryu's block of Walter Humala being fully justified, and possibly mild. When someone nominates Miscellany for Deletion itself for deletion at Miscellany for Deletion, they are being disruptive, ''at best'' out of an effort to make a joke; and when this comes after a history of 8 other blocks, by different admins, several for disruption, I am not going to insist any admins assume good faith. --
[AnonEMouse]: Oh, if only we had a good encyclopedia at hand ... wait ... :-) [[Pornography]] quoth \""the explicit representation of the human body or sexual activity with the goal of sexual arousal and\/or sexual relief.\"" That sounds like a pretty good definition, and fairly consistent with the American Heritage Dictionary's \""Sexually explicit pictures, writing, or other material whose primary purpose is to cause sexual arousal\"".[http:\/\/dictionary.reference.com\/search?q=pornography] Your article says \""Pinky violence\"", which implies nuns getting beaten up, which, that doesn't seem like \""human body or sexual activity\"", so wouldn't fit. The cover image in the infobox, on the other hand, also implies a certain amount of gratutious nudity, so if then I imagine it would. --
[AnonEMouse]: There is such a thing; let's see.... --
[AnonEMouse]: I was actually trying to show you how ''you'' could do it... sigh. --
[AnonEMouse]: Bless you. Chicken soup. Hot lemon. Pick some students you really don't like, and surreptitiously sneeze on their papers before you hand them back. :-) --
[AnonEMouse]: Actually, if any unclothed children pop up in \""my\"" areas, then they probably would be... :-) But I see your point. However, at that discussion, it doesn't look like anyone agrees with D-Kuru that the image is pornographic, they seem to be agreeing with you that the main problem is questionable copyright. If the pornography problem comes up, say, and I'll see if I can be of any help, though my editing background here is equally likely to be a hindrance. --
[AnonEMouse]: --
[AnonEMouse]: I'm going to put the last version in [[User:Catherineyronwode\/Carroll Runyon]] for you. You can try to improve it there to make a better argument for undeletion. Write me when you've made a good stab at it, and we'll take it first to Yomangani, then, if necessary, to deletion review. --
[AnonEMouse]: Is the release getting attention in porn media? More than press releases, multiple actual articles and\/or reviews, by more than one-person fan sites? If so, that would be Mid, attention over 30 years is fairly regular. If it actually gets multiple non-trivial articles in mainstream media, that could be High. If no one is writing actual articles about it in either mainstream or porn sources, other than just listing it among the hundreds of others they have available for purchase, that would be Low. (Assuming it got some articles, for example some paragraphs in your books, at the time of original release. If not even that, it could be deleted for lack of notability.) --
[AnonEMouse]: Anyway, so, Catherine looked what James's name was on Citizendium, and noticed that he was, in fact, an associate of Phillip Lindsay, they wrote together. I recall that name from previous arguments, and am not quite sure why that is necessarily such a terrible accusation. The talk page section seems to end appropriately - James has moved on, let's wish him luck at Citizendium. --
[AnonEMouse]: You have to realize that though I have a fair bit of experience on Wikipedia in general, I also have little or no knowledge of the subject specifically. Since the last time I looked at the article, the main changes I could see were that the Criticism or Controversy section has been dispersed to different sections of the article. I don't know if that is good or bad, it's certainly arguable either way. If you can give a link or [[wp:diff|diff]] of sections with specific questions you want me to help discuss, I can try to do that. If you have been specifically insulted, you can also give a diff to that, and I can also see if I can help there. --
[AnonEMouse]: Well, I certainly won't if she can't tell me specifically what that is. I understand the whole thing is contentious, but the article and talk page has been so huge, I need specific bits to focus on. --
[AnonEMouse]: There are lots of image debates that come up with people wanting to include commercial copyrighted pictures in the Wikipedia, which we can't do, but photos of artworks over 100 years old or so are generally considered public domain, and with ancient Hebrew calligraphy you'd be talking about artworks over 1000 years old... --
[AnonEMouse]: Please, don't fight. I'm sure you have something useful to contribute, and she has something useful to contribute. Focus on that, not on trying to somehow sanction the other person. We're all in this together. --
[AnonEMouse]: It seems like a passing residence of less than a year. I'm not sure what the criteria for being \""from\"" a place are, for purposes of our category, but I thought something more significant more than that, either birth in a place, or long term residence for most of their lives, or their most notable period, would be required. Most modern people change residences quite a few times in their lives, and listing every place they ever lived for even short periods would requires most of our entries to be included in  half a dozen categories of \""people from\"". --
[AnonEMouse]: That is a point. Not that it's the best advertisement for Montana, of course; as if [[Ted Kaczynski]] wasn't bad enough. I'll leave it. --
[AnonEMouse]: None of this is suitable for export to Wikiquote - that is for quotable phrases, not for fragments that are essentially being used as their own references. --
[AnonEMouse]: Just making sure. You deleted [[:Image:L&H Our Relations 1936.jpg]] way back in June with the comment ''CSD I5: Is unused and not free''. However, the [[Special:Whatlinkshere\/Image:L%26H_Our_Relations_1936.jpg |What links here page for that image]] doesn't work. There is something that used it, namely the page about movie in question [[Our Relations]], but it's not listed in what links here. Any objection if I restore the poster? --
[AnonEMouse]: That was fast, thanks! --
[AnonEMouse]: In [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Aurora_Snow&diff=167246320&oldid=165479429 this edit] had the above interesting comment. As far as I know, the MOS specifically encourages linking full dates, in [[Wp:date#Autoformatting_and_linking]]. Where do you see otherwise? --
[AnonEMouse]: The examples in [[Wp:date#Dates_of_birth_and_death]] are clear, that dates of birth and death are usually linked. --
[AnonEMouse]: It hovers somewhere around there consistently. It was higher when I was expanding it to FA level, around the end of last year, then fell as it stabilized. --
[AnonEMouse]: If Kwork wants to leave, we can't make him stay. If he writes that if unblocked, he will go back to doing whatever he was blocked for, that is not a good sign. By the way, what exactly was that thing he was blocked for? --
[AnonEMouse]: Also it bothers me a bit that you seem to think our goal is thwarting consensus. Isn't our goal supposed to be achieving consensus? Note that our definition of [[Wikipedia:consensus]] is a lot laxer around here - we don't insist on complete agreement, just something that all sides can, grudgingly, live with. --
[AnonEMouse]: That section you link to doesn't seem to have any Kwork messages at all. Are you referring to the one just above it, [[Talk:Alice Bailey#creating Wikipedia bullshit]]? And which edits were those Jossi deleted, please? Kwork mentioned he would restore them if unblocked. --
[AnonEMouse]: These, perhaps? http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Talk:Alice_Bailey&diff=167065889&oldid=167065235 ? --
[AnonEMouse]: He came close.[http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Talk:Alice_Bailey&diff=prev&oldid=167300026] [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Talk:Alice_Bailey&diff=prev&oldid=167414108] But that's splitting hairs. The important point is that article talk pages are for discussing how to improve the article. They're not for attacking anyone, not even the long-dead article subject. There is a noticeable difference between writing \""the article subject is a vicious antisemitic liar, and anyone who follows her is a halfwit\"", and \""we should write in our article that the following reliable sources question the veracity of the article subject\"". The article talk page is for discussing the latter. It is not for discussing the former. If Kwork understands the difference, and can promise to stick to improving the article, and not go off on rather harsh attacks on anyone who follows AAB, I'll unblock him myself. Or, rather, I'll ask JPGordon if he minds first, but from reading JPGordon's talk page, I gather he wants to wash his hands of the whole sordid mess, so I think he won't mind. --
[AnonEMouse]: One more. Very well done; I'm only sorry I didn't participate in the candidacy discussion. --
[AnonEMouse]: I really hope I'm not speaking into the wind. I write this, and people seem to listen for a while, and then I get posts about how some other editor feels about Gentiles, or how whether Bailey is a liar, or Sjoo is a nut case. This isn't about our philosophies, folks. This is only about an encyclopedia article. We aren't here to write the truth, merely what other people wrote. If Bailey is a liar (or a saint) - so what? We still write what she wrote. If Sjoo is a nut case (or brilliant) - so what? We still write what she wrote. Our article is supposed to reflect what the world thinks, not [[Wikipedia:The Truth]]. --
[AnonEMouse]: You are right. Reverting. --
[AnonEMouse]: Absolutely. Print sources are excellent. You generally want to give title, author, publication date (ISBN if possible), and page number. --
[AnonEMouse]: The Mo Foster edits are clearly in bad faith, I semi-protected the article. For the others, the best way to show notability is to give a few [[Wikipedia:reliable sources]] writing about them. Magazine articles like the ones on the [[Mo Foster]] article are fine. Other options are awards, listing of \""chart\"" placements, that sort of thing. But, honestly, I was debating whether to protect the article or block the IP. If he deletes more information, drop me a note and I'll block him. --
[AnonEMouse]: Sorry for not responding earlier, you placed this comment at the top of my talk page in the archivebox comment. I semi-protected [[The Hamsters]] and its talk page because what was going on was not discussion but namecalling and abuse. Others had tried to remove the abuse and respond to the actual substantive comments, but it was repeatedly restored. --
[AnonEMouse]: This is called \""how the sausage is made\"" :-). No, I would prefer others to perceive the Wikipedia works by polite, reasoned discussion, recognizing that all sides want to improve the encyclopedia, and trying to reach agreement, or at least compromise. But it does occasionally happen that people edit not in good faith, but instead in order to damage the encyclopedia, for whatever reason. When that happens, we have to do things such as [[WP:PROT|protect articles]] and [[WP:BLOCK|block users]]. --
[AnonEMouse]: Magazine articles are [[Wikipedia:reliable sources]], and are one of the classic ways to demonstrate [[Wikipedia:Notability]]. You are right that the Plymouth University is irrelevant to the article in question. --
[AnonEMouse]: The specific dates for the magazines are given. The online version on the magazine's own sites aren't very thorough, either only having the current issues, or not going back that far. --
[AnonEMouse]: I'm sorry, I have no idea what the Drake Circus is. But I guess I need to look. One moment... --
[AnonEMouse]: If that is basically right, then I, at least, would be pleased as punch if the DC article were to be expanded explaining about Reynolds and Babbage and other things. With references, hopefully. However, I fear that if it were unprotected, it would, instead, be used to [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Drake_Circus&diff=prev&oldid=168205397 remove any reference to DCSC] and [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Drake_Circus&diff=168062236&oldid=168061766 add a list of shops]. Any assurances otherwise? --
[AnonEMouse]: See, I think I know what WebHamster meant when he said the list of shops was a phonebook. He's basically right, though of course there aren't any phone numbers on the list. Basically he meant that it was a list of information of only current value; information that will change from year to year, and only really be of value to people who want to shop there right now. It's a phonebook in the sense that to be current a new issue has to come out every year. Unlike, say, an encyclopedia, which is supposed to contain information that is a bit less sensitive to the passage of time than that. A hundred years from now, no one will care that such and such a book shop was there from 2005 through 2007, unless it was a truly exceptionally notable book shop in its own right. They will care if [[Charles Babbage]] or [[Joshua Reynolds]] did something important there, because those were truly exceptionally notable people. If you have information (hopefully with references) about those, please do say. --
[AnonEMouse]: Better at larger resolutions, of course, but few pictures aren't. --
[AnonEMouse]: Not that I know of. There is [[Talk:Jerry_Lee_Lewis#WIFE_KILLER_.3F.3F|a question about that]] on the article talk page, but it doesn't get any good answer, and there aren't any talk page archives. I gather it just hasn't been written about yet. A [[wikipedia:coatrack|coatrack]] article is usually about people not famous except for one event, that is really writing about the event under the person's name. [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] is famous for quite a number of things, including legendary hit music, and, yes, multiple scandals. As long as we don't skimp on the coverage of the music, which should be substantial, writing about the scandals is also important. [[Rolling Stone]] is about as respected as source as their is in the music world. Make sure everything you write is well sourced, don't read more into the article than it says. I gather you mean \""The Strange and Mysterious Death of Mrs. Jerry Lee Lewis\"", Richard Ben Cramer, ''Rolling Stone'', March 1, 1984? I can't find that on line anywhere, but it is mentioned in several places. I imagine you can find it in a library, many are good at collecting ''Rolling Stone''. It would be good to have the actual story you are citing, not just a paraphrase. The Rolling Stone biography will do, but having the full length story is better. Good luck. --
[AnonEMouse]: By the way, here, you absolutely would need to use inline references, as I advised with [[#Dan Crary]], above. I noticed you didn't do that there. I advise using better references even on [[Dan Crary]], but here, if you want to write about someone being suspected of murder, you absolutely need to use very good referencing. [[WP:CITE]] is the guideline in question. --
[AnonEMouse]: Thank you very much! --
[AnonEMouse]: No, thank you. That's a tough job that I don't have enough dedication for. But if you are interested, I can \""endorse\"", [[User:Newyorkbrad]] and [[User:Raul654]], who have enough wisdom and dedication for any other twenty people. --
[AnonEMouse]: I weighed in there, and found you some more sources for his bio; added to the AfD page, hopefully you'll do the honors of mining them for actual facts for the article. Don't put \""notes\"" on the main article page, though, if you want to address something about the AfD, use the AfD page. --
[AnonEMouse]: I think the deleters had a point. If you can find a couple of real sources, you can rewrite, but I don't think very much from the deleted version will help. --
[AnonEMouse]: Eh. Six of one, half a dozen of the other. I guess they could have deleted three quarters of the article for for WP:BLP issues due being speculative and\/or derogatory and\/or unsourced, then nominated the small stub that was left at WP:AFD, at which point it would have been deleted 5 days later ... but then [[Wp:not#Wikipedia is not a bureaucracy]]: \""rules are not the purpose of the community\""; \""Follow the spirit, not the letter, of any rules, policies and guidelines if you feel they conflict.\"". I would probably not have speedied it for reasons similar to yours, but I'm a bit softer on such things than others. I can't fault them; or at least I'm not going to. It's a procedural error at most, and not a very large one. In the end, the question is \""should the Wikipedia have an article on Erika Nagai?\"" If we can't make a good case that we should, I don't think it's worth raising a big fuss about the fact that we don't. --
[AnonEMouse]: Nothing is permanent around here; I can unsalt it much the same way I can restore it, and if I weren't around you could go to [[User:Tabercil]] or [[User:Joe Beaudoin Jr.]] or any one of 1200 other [[Wikipedia:Administrator]]s. Everything is a temporary measure here because the real world changes. If Erika Nagai makes a record breaking film or assassinates the Pope, you will bet the article will be restored quite quickly. Or, rather, in this case, possibly rewritten from scratch, since there wasn't that much useful stuff there, honest. --
[AnonEMouse]: You don't need to do all of these things, just some, to get a B, as it is quite close to a B now. If you do all of these things, and get a native English speaker to correct the stuff an automated spell-checker won't, you can start thinking about [[Wikipedia:Good article]]... :-) --
[AnonEMouse]: [[Elisabeth Olin]] is also close to B. Yes, it needs a few sections. It has a picture already, though, which helps. :-) References, sections, a spell-check, and it will be a B. --
[AnonEMouse]: I also replied by email. --
[AnonEMouse]: Added, will try to watch. --
[AnonEMouse]: Sort of. :-) I didn't say much about the suitability of the PNT, but I did find a better source, I think, and even more, evidence that she isn't hiding the name, which is probably most important. Posted there. --
[AnonEMouse]: Because we only have the word of an anonymous blogger that the subject confirms it's true. It's not an interview with a reliable source. Luke is quoting the blog post, but he isn't saying \""yes, Sasha confirmed this to me\"", he's just saying \""here's what some blogger wrote\""; in fact, even if Luke did, we'd worry, because Luke's status as a reliable source is borderline. He's an expert in the field, but he's just one guy, we generally don't use individuals for sources for highly controversial information that aren't backed up by better sources. For highly controversial items about living persons, we want very good sources. For example, your edit to [[Robin Williams]] was backed by a very good source. --
[AnonEMouse]: Sorry, I don't know how I missed this question. You mean [[Template:Bluegrassmusic]]? Templates differ - generally you want to be extremely careful with complicated templates, but this seems to be straightforward. [[Template talk:Bluegrassmusic]] also seems to say feel free to edit it, so I'd say go ahead... but I'm not quite sure what you want to do, though, it merely lists [[Banjo]] and we don't really have a separate 5 string Banjo article; you want to change the title of that link to \""5 string Banjo\""? If you think you know what you are doing, though, be bold; at worst someone will complain, and then if you are polite about it, you will be able to come to some compromise. Do take the time to take a look at several articles that use the template immediately after your change, though, and make sure you haven't blown anything up. :-) --
[AnonEMouse]: I'm worried that WP:BLP policy is taken much more seriously than Jaywalking laws. While a policeman trying to enforce jaywalking laws in all but the most extreme case would be laughed at, I greatly fear that there are plenty of editors and administrators who will take the strongly phrased policy at its word, and remove expert sources from many BLP articles \""just to be safe\"". What can you suggest to avoid that? --
[AnonEMouse]: I don't think it's Satan, but I do think it's [[Phil, the Prince of Insufficient Light]]. I just skimmed it, but I don't see them saying that they used a shot of Sora Aoi, just a naked woman. And, frankly, even if it is Sora Aoi, I don't see either them saying that they picked her for some specific reason, or that she got any fame from it, or they got any special infamy from it. So I don't think it adds that much to the article, and given the sourcing problems (the main problem with YouTube is that it's full of rampant copyright violations, which I strongly suspect this is an example of), I don't think it's worth the hassle. Sorry. --
[AnonEMouse]: I didn't see that, but didn't look very hard. Can you see if you can find out and give the name, channel, and date of the TV program? ([[Arirang TV]], I'd guess...) If so, you might be able to cite it as a source even if the YouTube link is removed, similarly to being able to cite a newspaper article for a source even if it's not online. (Stress on the ''might'' however.) --
[AnonEMouse]: No problem making it present tense if you have a more recent reference. I was just worried by the 16 year gap. Feel free to expand further. :-) --
[AnonEMouse]: Makes sense, that is her web site, and what she was in Penthouse as. Moved. By the way, her web site is God's gift to writing an article - look at all these sources! [http:\/\/www.melissasmansion.com\/news.html] <small>You ''know'' you've been editing too long when you go to a web site about a nude model, and the thing that really interests you are the sources...<\/small>--
[AnonEMouse]: [[Image:WikiThanks.png|43px|left|WikiThanks]] Thanks! --
[AnonEMouse]: I don't think it's relevant, and it's such a picayune detail that it seems like we are stalking him. The article doesn't say he was particularly rich as a policeman, and just writing that he could buy a home and a boat clearly shows that he is not in the throes of poverty, that should be sufficient. --
[AnonEMouse]: I gather that seems to have been settled over the weekend, correct? --
[AnonEMouse]: Right, I see it there now, and thanks again! --
[AnonEMouse]: Probably not. [[User:Joe Beaudoin Jr.]] apparently loves userboxes, and is a founding member, but I can't find one among the many on his page. If there were one, I would think he would have it. We could ask him, but I think that means there isn't one. \""An opportunity for the interested student\"", I guess. But, um ... how shall I put this ... don't go too wild. :-). Especially with some of the images that Videmus Omnia has gotten to be released, the possibilities to really embarrass ourselves are definitely there. :-) --
[AnonEMouse]: Thanks. I hoped you would see it that way, but unasked for advice does run the risk of being more offensive than helpful, I'm glad I got lucky. :-) You know, a bit over a week ago, I thought I'd be supporting you for arbcom; I looked around your user space and was very impressed with the idea of giving awards to reformed vandals, I thought that was exactly the kind of attitude we didn't have enough of. We have plenty of \""indefinite block and throw away the key\"" hard liner admins, plenty of \""let's give then yet another and another and another chance\"" softy admins (I'm one of those, I think :-) ), but the \""tough but appreciative\"" combination was very rare. Ah well. Stick around. As I think I wrote already, if you just keep doing the ''good'' things you do regularly, not only I, but most of your current critics will probably support you for a return RFA in three or four months. If you ''want'' the buttons back, of course, it's not a low-stress job at any time. --
[AnonEMouse]: Oh my. Thanks very much for pointing that out; no, I wasn't aware of it. I think I've \""met\"" morbidthoughts (he had some nice Flickr photos that I asked if we could use, and got turned down because we couldn't accept the \""no modifications\"" clause), and he mentioned he was a Wikipedia editor. I guess I should log in there and say something, especially as some noted figures seem to be participating. Unfortunately I'll have to be very careful what I write, not to offend people, and will probably still be roasted over an open fire for my troubles. Let me take a deep breath and look into other things first, as this won't be easy. (And you sent me ''two'' emails to look into... thanks... I think...)--
[AnonEMouse]: Well, the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject_Pornography\/Assessment#Importance_scale]] says Top should be \""subjects famous within pornography and indisputably notable even outside pornography. In other words, they have many in depth articles, documentaries, films, or books from both mainstream and porn sources devoted to them.\"" Examples include Linda Lovelace, Ron Jeremy, Hugh Hefner, Playboy, names that even many people not familiar with pornography specifically will know. For US films, that would probably be ''Deep Throat'', maybe ''Debbie Does Dallas'', and possibly that's it. For Japan, you'll have to be the judge. I know that if an American late night comedian can name either of those two movie titles in the punchline of a joke and not have any worry about most of his audience recognizing them. Would that be true about ''Wife to be Sacrificed''? If only people familiar with Japanese exploitation cinema would know the title (but all of those would), then High would be about right. If you don't know what the Japanese man-on-the-street knows about the movie, you can look at the in depth sources on the film. I see it has several indepth articles devoted to it in Asian Cult Cinema, but that's really in genre. Are there any indepth mainstream books or articles about it? There are loads on Playboy, for example, and our article on [[Deep Throat]] has articles in the New York Times and the Guardian, not even counting Lovelace's autobiographies; [[Debbie Does Dallas]] doesn't have those, but does have a documentary and a Broadway show... Does it matter one way or the other? Well, no. Not really. :-) These are internal-only markings, they're meant to be there because some editors like to be able to find a list of \""important\"" subjects that could use a bit more editor effort, and because the \""important\"" subjects ''probably'' have more sources to be expanded. But they're not part of our product, the articles themselves. --
[AnonEMouse]: That's why I say I'm leaving it up to you as the subject expert - I do the best I can, I'm not the fount of all knowledge on everything. In general, when a genre expert comes to me and says \""X is more notable than you think\"", I generally say \""OK\"". Besides you on Japan, there have been a couple of people who didn't think I knew enough about French stars, and of course they were right, I don't. There was also a happy few months when we had a gay porn expert contributing that I could ask similar questions of - \""do you know who Y is?\"" and he could say - \""yes, he won the following 3 prizes\"" or \""no, wouldn't know him from Adam ... or Steve ...\"" It doesn't have to be an English language book; that is preferable for easier verifiability, but it's not required, if there is only a Japanese language book, that would do.--
[AnonEMouse]: Yes, I was wondering if I should point that out to you if you hadn't seen it yourself. That is very relevant. You can use it as a model, but also take a look at the Peer Review and Featured Article Discussion for that article, (linked to from the article talk page, a drop down list at the top) and see if you can apply it to your candidates before your reviewers do. :-) --
[AnonEMouse]: Whew. I made an account, wrote a reply, [[User:AnonEMouse\/AdultDVDTalk]], and linked to it in the thread. I hope this helps more than it hurts. For revenge ;-) I dropped your user name in that doc as well. May you be swamped with freely released images! --
[AnonEMouse]: Gee, thanks, guys, you're both really too kind! --
[AnonEMouse]: We can if you like, but it's not a purple heart, you know, it's a purple barnstar. It's for virtual damage. The only thing being shot up is your reputation - though, since you have been a public speaker about the WP, that's a painful target, ''and'' The Guardian is fairly large caliber weaponry. But it's your award, I'll change it to what you like. (PS: I've never attended your presentations, but from reading them, you said good things. I would absolutely hate to lose you. Illegitimi non carborundum.) --
[AnonEMouse]: OK, I'm impressed, I'm impressed. Both of you. :-) But frankly, you both had already impressed me, what with the speeches and detective work and crowns from one, and the amazing image proliferation and article subject contacts from the other. <small>What do you want, a medal... er, let me rephrase that... :-)<\/small> Stop before Tony the Marine feels he needs to show up and list his real life badges as well! :-) --
[AnonEMouse]: I see I edited [[Michelle Manhart]] once, but I can't remember it. Not on my watchlist. [[Kimberly Hampton]] is my only real lady warrior article; though that one does have a picture, it's a completely different \""theme\"". Not a BLP violation at all; the exact opposite, unfortunately. But that one brings it back to the medal theme, and I guess one of you might be able to know, though she was Army, not Navy or Air Force. What could the Associated Press mean when they wrote she got a \""Bronze medal\""? It would be nice if I could make that into an explanatory link... --
[AnonEMouse]: Thanks, I'll go with that. --
[AnonEMouse]: I wouldn't call it a dispute, it's one edit. Neither 1976 or 1978 is that well sourced IAFD says 1978, http:\/\/www.iafd.com\/person.rme\/perfid=MMayhem\/gender=f AFDB says 1976 http:\/\/www.adultfilmdatabase.com\/actor.cfm?actorid=23542, IMDB says 1978 http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/name\/nm1018466\/bio and claims to be edited by Monica Mayhem herself, so I guess that \""wins\"". If it becomes a matter of real controversy with edits going back and forth, we can remove it altogether until Ms. Mayhem writes the real date on her web site or an interview or other real article shows up. --
[AnonEMouse]: If you're in touch with her personally, you may want to ask how she feels about her birth name being in the article. It is on the IMDB profile she allegedly wrote, and it is what her web site is registered under, which implies she doesn't mind it being public that much. --
[AnonEMouse]: It actually then goes on to say the other way around is also acceptable. But not a big deal. --
[AnonEMouse]: You're welcome; thank you for doing a good job writing it. It really is much better than the average article we have, and if you fix those points you may want to nom it for FA. Personally, I would have written the same criticism if it had been nominated for FA - I find it difficult to differentiate between the two levels of quality many times. The main differences between GA and FA as far as I can tell are that for GA you need to satisfy one reviewer, and for FA, many, who will look at different issues. Best of luck. --
[AnonEMouse]: Ah, I think I see the problem. [[June Wilkinson]]? I think the issue is that the article doesn't actually use that interview to back any facts, so it's not really a Source as such. It would still be a fine External link, except it's not actually a link. It seems to be a note as to where to look for further reading. Let's what [[WP:MOS]] says - ah, here. [[WP:MOS#Section management]]. You can call it ''Further reading'' (or ''Bibliography'') and it should be fine until you have the time to turn it into a reference. If it comes up again, drop me a line. --
[AnonEMouse]: No, that's a perfectly reasonable action. Please don't get your hackles up about that silly pronoun trouble incident, it's not worth it. Keep working to help, it's a good idea, honest. --
[AnonEMouse]: Er ... thanks, but I'm not sure why you think I'd be interested, I don't recall ever editing either image, or any related article. --
[AnonEMouse]: Ahem. The infamous Kamui\/Kamui99\/Kamui Sendoh was my inspiration for creating [[Commons:Commons:Questionable Flickr images]], and bears a prominent role therein, no less than three links discussing him. Please take a look at that page, that's what it's for, and add any others there as well. In short - yes, it's ''highly'' questionable he owns the copyright to all of \""his\"" images, enough so that I would recommend considering any of his images suspect. His heart is probably in the right place, as he has contributed to Wikipedia personally, but his stand on copyright is rather questionable. --
[AnonEMouse]: # Good question! :-) [[Wikipedia:Image#Obtaining_images]] is for images that already exist. Very old images (death of author + 100 years), mostly photos of paintings, are probably public domain already, under [[Template:PD-art]]. For more recent people, [[User:AnonEMouse\/Images|I personally have had some good luck]] looking in the official sites of the US Library of Congress, US Presidential libraries, the official US Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine, Coast Guard sites for a few more (all pictures taken by a member of the US Federal Government in the performance of their duties are public domain), the Creative Commons (we can use Attribution and Share-Alike) search of [[Flickr]]. When that fails, ask. [[User:Videmus Omnia\/Requesting free content]] explains how to do that better than I could - the important part is you have to ask them to make the image available for everyone to use, not just us, the Wikipedia. Tell them that we're the #8 web site in the whole world, so ''a lot'' of people could be seeing their photo, which we will attribute (give credit) for them as they like, that helps a bit. Success rate for asking Flickr users who took a picture of someone at a convention or book signing or trade show is about 60%, for asking the people themselves or their publicist is maybe 20%, so steel yourself for a fair bit of rejection ... and make up for it by sending a lot of requests. :-) You might also hit it very lucky and find a hobbyist or even professional who has a lot of photos who is willing to freely license the lot of them, [[User:Tabercil\/Luke Ford permission|Tabercil did that]], and it has been a real boon to [[WP:P*]]. --
[AnonEMouse]: Grr. You don't ask the easy questions, do you? :-) I'd say no, but I wish the articles described just how explicitly erotic these films were. [[Pornography]] is defined in our article as \""the explicit representation of the human body or sexual activity with the goal of sexual arousal and\/or sexual relief.\"" If the nudity or sex isn't explicitly presented on the screen, but just hinted at, it's not pornography by that definition, no matter how erotic it is. I haven't seen either of those two films so will have to use a different one for an example: have you seen ''[[Tampopo]]''? There is a scene there where a couple kiss to pass a raw egg back and forth until it breaks. Or if you haven't seen that, you've surely seen at least one of any number of videos of girls suggestively eating lollipops or bananas. That's all pretty clearly sexy, but all implicit, not explicit. --
[AnonEMouse]: No, thank ''you''; I noticed the excellent job someone who hasn't been logging in has been doing on the article. I think it's clearly better than the one of mine Disavian nominated above, for example. Give me a bit of time to do some cleanup, I've not edited in a while, and a lot of tasks have piled up in just a couple of weeks, but then I will certainly jump in and help. By the way, have you thought about getting a user account? It only has benefits, really. For one thing, I will be able to somehow think of you as other than ''strange string of numbers''. :-) --
[AnonEMouse]: On the other hand, of course being marked as of interest to the Wikiproject doesn't mean it is pornographic in itself - for example, several pornography-related supreme court cases aren't pornographic in themselves, yet highly important to the study of pornography.  If ''Mme Aena'' opened the door to films that clearly were pornographic, it would probably be of interest... Sigh. Can I cop out to \""use your best judgment\""? :-P --
[AnonEMouse]: Thanks! I'm honored and unworthy! :-) I responded on\/in the article and talk page. --
[AnonEMouse]: Will do soon (prob. tomorrow), a lot of work has been done. --
[AnonEMouse]: Yes, I think you're in error. It's certainly ''allowed'' that we crop the image, but it's, well, ''rude''. The contributor asked nicely that we not crop the image, and if possible, we should respect his wishes. It's as if he gave us an artwork as a present; it's certainly allowed that we mutilate the artwork, it's ours, but it clearly hurts the feelings of the giver. If we can avoid it, we should. --
[AnonEMouse]: In addition, I see you cropped the image without renaming it. It's now ''called'' \""Michael G. Halle and Tonya Harding.jpg\"" but only shows Harding. That's clearly wrong. --
[AnonEMouse]: --
[AnonEMouse]: You're welcome. I noticed you sort of stuck all three \""Personal life\"" paragraphs together. I thought that keeping them the way they were would be better, since that way, each had sort of a theme, while still being over the two sentences that CP doesn't seem to like for paragraphs: one was about her and her family, one was about her and motorcycles, and one was about her exercising and hobbies. --
[AnonEMouse]: If I hadn't already supported you for stewardship, I'd be wishing I had. --
[AnonEMouse]: Done - in fact I'm not sure I understood the mature content issue, so if I did that wrong, feel free to undo it. --
[AnonEMouse]: Hurrah! It couldn't happen to a nicer article. :-) --
[AnonEMouse]: They can be created quickly and easily. The worst that can happen is the category will be deleted at [[Wikipedia:Categories for discussion]] - you can take a look at that and [[Wikipedia:Categories]] for guidelines. If you're trying to add a category to a page about a person, you want [[Wikipedia:Categorization of people]]. One fairly common issue that usually causes a category to be removed is called \""performer by performance\"", for example \""Singers who have covered Danny Boy\"", or something like that. A category should usually be something relatively important and uncontroversial about the subject, and something that won't change trivially. --
[AnonEMouse]: Discuss it with him, on the talk page of that article. That's what it's for. It looks like he proposed removing that section in [[Talk:Alija_Izetbegovi%C4%87#War_crimes_investigation]], and no one has responded there yet. --
[AnonEMouse]: Responded on article talk page. Please, do fix it, I'm all for giving out the little green plus. :-) --
[AnonEMouse]: Sorry I'm taking so long to weigh in, but, first, I don't really know much about the Grammys, and, second, it is a tough call. I like the idea of having information in the Wikipedia (shock!), but there is something to be said for the \""original research\"" issue as well. The best solution would be to cite this information to a source. Surely there is some publication somewhere that keeps this data? --
[AnonEMouse]: You'll need to get permission from the image owner. The Flickr user, Scott Pasfield, seems to be a professional photographer, so he probably understands about image rights. If he says he is the image owner, you will need to get his permission. The easiest way for him to give it is to change the tags on the image in Flickr to Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) or Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike (CC-BY-SA). A more complicated way is for him to email you the image, and the statement \""I own the rights to the attached image, and release it under the Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike license\"", and you to forward that email to permissions (at) wikimedia.org. If he does that, we can use the image. We can't use it without a permission like that. --
[AnonEMouse]: You'll notice that one worked. :-) --
[AnonEMouse]: You're welcome. I read the article talk page and saw the request. Why was I looking at the article talk page? I was probably clicking around following interesting links from people's user pages, or contributions, or articles. I'm not sure myself, really. :-) --
[AnonEMouse]: Seems reasonable. I personally worry about the prominence given to a specific ''sixth of a second'' of film...  <small>squeamish? me?<\/small>--
[AnonEMouse]: Ack! I missed one. So sorry. Hemlock! --
[AnonEMouse]: Looking at your recent edit history, the [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Yuki_Asuka&diff=prev&oldid=183679223 link you added to Yuki Asuka], for example, worked for me.  --
[AnonEMouse]: That said, I'm not sure that every review of every film a star has appeared in is a good use of external links. Just from sheer numbers, I know Japanese stars appear in fewer films than American stars, but still, ten films, each reviewed in two magazines, that's twenty external links, and the content isn't usually very focused on the single actor our article is supposed to be about. --
[AnonEMouse]: You do have a point; our criteria for porn star notability is for awards, or unique contribution, or major media notice, and I haven't seen that, independent of the outing. Want to write an article in your user space that looks like what your proposed rewrite would look like? I objected because I thought it would be hard to do justice to what the media has written about him in an article titled merely \""Sanchez incident\"" but maybe you can do it. --
[AnonEMouse]: Then, if we think we have something that can at least have some chance of withstanding challenge, put it up in main space and wait for the AfD to argue about it. Are you willing to put in the work to do that? If so, I can start by moving a deleted version to your (or my) userspace to work from. It might get deleted even so, since we wouldn't have any clear cut claim to notability such as an award, or an indepth mainstream source covering her. We would merely have a lot of borderline sources covering her. For that, having a well written article could make the difference between a Keep and a Delete. Are you willing to take the chance? --
[AnonEMouse]: Addressed, I think. If not, we'll talk it over with the nominator. On a side note, did I mention how useful a user account is? Get one, while they're going cheap! Be the first on your IP block... :-) --
[AnonEMouse]: Being used as a reference doesn't make a source notable in itself. Being a reference source means you write useful, reliable, information. Notable means other sources write about you. They're not quite the same things. Will look. --
[AnonEMouse]: I also looked at Alexa, which [http:\/\/www.alexa.com\/data\/details\/traffic_details\/xfanz.com says] traffic rank of 97,260 Avn.com has a traffic rank of 16,282 [http:\/\/alexa.com\/data\/details\/traffic_details\/avn.com]. Even Lukeisback.com has a traffic rank of 33,667 [http:\/\/alexa.com\/data\/details\/traffic_details\/lukeisback.com]. That's not nearly as important as people writing about you, though. Get two reasonable, indepth, articles, more than two paragraphs long, from even alternative sources, ''[[Village Voice]]'', or ''[[LA Weekly]]'', or ''[[Phoenix New Times]]'' or even pornographic sources, such as ''[[Adult Video News]]'' or ''[[Hustler]]'' or ''[[Playboy]]'', written by an actual author, not just a reprinted press release, and I will argue that Xfanz deserves a Wikipedia article. --
[AnonEMouse]: Ah, I knew we had to have one of these. [[Wikipedia:Why create an account?]] --
[AnonEMouse]: Good question. The only thing I can think of is that you should give the section title in the section= link, not the whole page plus section. I [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Talk:Nontrinitarianism&diff=prev&oldid=186872827 restored it, with today's date], let's see if it shows up the next time BetacommandBot or RFCBot run. Also let me read up on the issue and see if I can weigh in. --
[AnonEMouse]: Since that image had one of those templates at the time you wrote that, giving great detail as to why the rationale was met, I have no clue what you're on about. Please don't use boilerplate that doesn't say what you mean. I gather you want the image deleted; if so, please say why. I'd also appreciate, as a personal favor, if you not rush, since I haven't been not very active for almost a year now, and it might take me some time to hold up my end of the discussion, though I will do my best. --
[AnonEMouse]: The image had \""one of the templates available from [[Wikipedia:Non-free use rationale guideline]]\"" for a year now. Please don't use boilerplate that doesn't say what you mean. --
[AnonEMouse]: If you want a response in fewer than the 6 months this took, ask someone who doesn't have an \""inactive\"" banner on their talk page. :-) --
[AnonEMouse]: Hm. The template [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=File:Silent_Prey.jpg&diff=267685540&oldid=251777725 added 11:18, November 14, 2008 by Sfan00 IMG] didn't have a purpose of use field. However the rationale I added at the time I uploaded the image distinctly said \""The image is used as the primary means of visual identification of the article section dealing with this video\"", which seems to be a fine purpose of use. So it seems that by adding the template Sfan actually made the image ''more'' likely to be deleted by someone, such as yourself, not less. Surely there is something wrong here. Oh well, thanks to Dekkappai, it's not an issue any more. Thanks, Dek. Good to see you too. --
[AnonEMouse]: Wow, great to hear you feel that way! How things change over [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship\/AnonEMouse|a few years]]! I'm afraid I can't promise anything long term, that real life stuff is still there. But great to hear that I made a positive impression on you somehow! --"

I first thought it was a joke, but nobody noticed, then I thought I had a sick mind.  I was afraid to even mention it.  Is it just me?  (worried)
[DyslexicEditor]: Also somebody else made a link to it on Jimbo's Talk page, which you've left up (it's the user box one).

VivaEmilyDavies,False,"[VivaEmilyDavies]: I see that you are an Orthodox Christian who has at some point been interested in the Hypatia article. I wondered if you could shed some light on a query I have about the article (see [[Talk:Hypatia of Alexandria#Use of the word \""dogma\""]]). I see that \""dogmatic\"" was used as a substitute for \""fundamentalist\"" after some debate but I am not certain that the people who decided on use of the word \""dogma\"" quite understand its theological meaning, especially in the Orthodox tradition. I don't completely understand it myself, but I did attend a lecture by the (largely anti-Christian) religious scholar [[Karen Armstrong]] who roundly condemned the use of \""dogmatic\"" as a term of abuse and stated her conclusion that, particularly in the Othodox understanding of it, dogma is actually a very good thing. She argued that its negative connotations had emerged partly because it was used by analogy on people (e.g. politicians) who acted in a blind, unthinking and uncritical belief and partly because less and less people understand the theological meaning. AFAICS, if an anti-Christian scholar is saying that dogma is good and dogmatic shouldn't be used to carry negative connotations, people ought to be wary of applying it, especially to Christians (for whom it holds a particular religious meaning distinct from the meaning of popular understanding) and also particularly to people who lived before it acquired its current connotations! You seem to be a fairly logical person to ask to see if I am barking up the wrong tree or not :) Any feedback would be appreciated, but if you really don't know\/don't care it's no problem. Sorry to bother you!
[VivaEmilyDavies]: Thanks for the reply! What was really bothering me about \""dogma\"" is that although it clearly represents something that from the viewpoint of the religion ''is'' certain, is it coupled with the recognition that from the outside of the religion, it may appear fundamentally uncertain, and that it is ultimately acknowledged to require a \""leap of faith\""? Also, does \""dogmatic\"" make (theological) sense as a way to refer to people with beliefs that might now be characterised as a \""fundamentalist\"", particularly rigid literalism and a tendency to try to see all things (including philosophical and scientific topics) through the prism of scripture? I know that \""dogmatic\"" in standard English can have this connotation, but it is at heart a theological term, and clearly the instigators of \""dogma\"" and \""dogmatic\"" as a term didn't intend it as a form of abuse! (I am also suspicious that Karen Armstrong mischaracterised the Orthodox approach to dogma: her presentation of it as a form of acknowledgement that ultimately belief in certain things requires an act of faith, and therefore is an acceptance of the limit of human knowledge of theological affairs, suits her own views on how religions should refrain from attempting reasoned, absolute proofs for themselves, but she doesn't seem to escape the fact that \""dogma\"", whether it requires faith or reason, still represents a firmly held belief, rejection of which may be seen as heretical...)"

[RFBailey]: I'm afraid I disagree with your comment at [[User talk:Siper101]], that ''Wikipedia has a full list of all the districts in Birmingham'': the eleven district committee areas divide the city up but there are still plenty of well-known, notable places that also deserve articles.  Admittedly the article that was created was not all that great, but it should have been listed for cleanup rather than deletion.  Remember [[WP:BITE]]!  --
[RFBailey]: It depends on your definition of \""district\"".  The city council has used the word for its formal subdivisions, which divide the city into 11 parts.  However, the term is often used more loosely to mean a suburb or an area of the city, such as [[Kings Heath]], [[Handsworth, West Midlands|Handsworth]], [[Kingstanding]] or [[Moseley]].  --

Don't just tell us after the event what you've implemented (e.g. the Great Northern Line), in the middle of the night UK-time when no-one is likely to be able to respond.

Having looked at your contributions, I can see that you practiacally ''never'' use them, which for an experienced editor like you is really not acceptable.  It's a real nuisance for other editors.

[RFBailey]: Emarsee, where is the consensus of which you speak?

[RFBailey]: There's a clear difference between ignoring behavioural guidelines such as 3RR and NPA and ignoring style guidelines when it will improve an article.  After all, there is an encyclopaedia here which is supposed to be being written.

[RFBailey]: Also, if you look at the [[:Template:Infobox_TV_channel#Example]] usage of that infobox, you'll see that it has the URL visible.  I still want to know where this \""consensus\"" exists--I'm coming to the conclusion that it does not exist.  --
[RFBailey]: Further on this topic, I have started this a discussion at [[Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style_(infoboxes)#URLs_in_infoboxes]].  --
[RFBailey]: Anyway, I agree that the http:\/\/ protocol should be omitted, although the \""www\"" should be included, as (occasionally) they are not part of the URL.  --
[RFBailey]: In cases such as the CTV Northern Ontario example you mention, putting the complete URL is clearly ridiculous.  An alternative would be to link to [http:\/\/www.ctv.ca\/local\/ www.ctv.ca\/local].  However, where there is an easily-remembered URL, such as [http:\/\/montreal.ctv.ca\/ montreal.ctv.ca] (which, incidentally, doesn't include a \""www\""), it is better to display it.  As a general principle, I think that showing the URL is more helpful.  --
[RFBailey]: Hi EoGuy.  I appreciate the work you put into fixing genuine spelling errors, but please read [[WP:ENGVAR]].  I just came across your edits to the article on [[New Age travellers]] from a few weeks ago [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=New_Age_travellers&action=historysubmit&diff=318956844&oldid=316818634], where you changed every instance of the word \""traveller\"" (the correct UK spelling) to the US \""traveler\"".  As the article is primarily about a subject in the United Kingdom (and New Zealand, which predominantly uses UK spellings), the UK spelling was perfectly acceptable, and in fact what is expected.  Please be more careful in future.  Thanks, --
[RFBailey]: Your edit summary [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Brunswick_railway_station&diff=394239696&oldid=394088141], \""repair hatnote\"", suggests that the hatnote was broken.  It wasn't--it linked to the disambiguation page I had created as I thought the previous hatnote needed simplifying.  (I had come across the article while adding categories, saw the hatnote, and decided it was rather clumsy and a disambiguation page would do a better job.)  --"

Goatchurch,False,"[Goatchurch]: Lamb Leer looks to me it would be two pages: one for the area, and one for the cave.  Or they could be combined with a subsection partway down the page.
[Goatchurch]: re: River Chew -- you're pulling way ahead of me.  I like it.  I've got a lot of other work to do for the next few weeks.  I guess you go to the tributory pages to get the GPS coordinates of those confluences (as the mouth).  The map bit at the bottom -- don't you think it could relate to the idea: [[Category_talk:Geobox#Located_Map]]  By locating the corresponding pixel position of the river source on your map to your listed GPS coordinates, and stating the map's scale, you make it possible to overlay it in any googleearth type framework.  These are the missing fragments of information required to nail any map down in position.  This might also solve any issues with defining the area of an SSSI if you have a map fragment containing its boundaries."
Finngall,False,"[Finngall]: Sorry about the quick speedy, but I'm not psychic.  I base these things on what's there, not what's ''going'' to be there.  What was there in the intial version was speedy-able due to language.  After is was modified, it was okay, and I withdrew the tag immediately with no problems.  Thanks again.
[Finngall]: I was thinking that the article should be moved to [[Nelson Burton Sr.]] with a redirect--what do you think?  Also, please note that there is also a [[Nelson Burton|hockey player]] by that name, so perhaps \""see also\"" links and\/or a disambiguation page would be in order. --
[Finngall]: The hockey player has been moved to [[Nelson Burton (hockey)]] and the dab page is in its place. I've also fixed links on the hockey pages that referenced the original. --

[Finngall]: You reverted a valid hangon tag on [[Michael wolin]], so I re-reverted it.  Sure, the article doesn't even have an American snowball's chance in Baghdad of surviving, but if the submitter places the hangon tag, it needs to be respected.  Thanks. --
[Finngall]: Yes, the reason is just as lame as the original article, but it seems like a violation of [[WP:AGF]] to revert the tag as a result.  Any sane admin will delete the article in a heartbeat, but that doesn't mean the submitter can't use accepted processes as long as they're not abusing them. --
[Finngall]: No, I think removing the ''speedy'' tag was reasonable, but I think an AfD nomination may be in order...Thanks. --
[Finngall]: It works like [[WP:AFD|this]]... --
[Finngall]: Thanks for pointing that one out.  I've gone ahead and redirected it. The original submitter can still pull stuff from old revisions and add it to the other article if desired. --

[JohnArmagh]: In its widest sense ''monarch'' could be also applied to any head of state, but I chose to use the term ''Head of State'' for the heads of sovereign or autonomous modern states, reserving ''Rulers'' for defunct states or modern tribal states or polities.  --
[JohnArmagh]: Reply posted on [[User talk:Billreid|Talk]] --
[JohnArmagh]: Certainly the incorportation of grammatic convention into propoer nouns can cause anomalies, albeit rare: for instance one may refer to the checkout at a particular Sainsbury's store as ''the Sainsbury's's checkouts'', whereas one should technically refer to checkouts at Sainsbury's stores in general as ''the Sainsbury'ses' checkouts''. --
[JohnArmagh]: I have removed the notice.  It is '''not''' an experiment or test page.
[JohnArmagh]: The rationale is that the word, amongst others, is repeated a significant number of times in the Monastic Houses of English counties articles.  Because these abbreviations are essentially \""specialist\"" each such article contains an index of abbreviations (by way of a template). (I am currently in the process of going through each county using data from Knowles & Hadcock's ''Medieval Religious Houses of England & Wales'' and introducing consistency as I go, as the county articles are also used as transclusions in the article which lists, by county, all monastic houses in England.)
[JohnArmagh]: That might well be the case, but the abbreviations are not of a specialist nature - they are of commonly-used often-repeated words, in their commonly-used definitions.  The lists are not of a specialist nature, and do not make such extensive reference to specialist information as do the works I am using to source the information - which are replete with unfamiliar abbreviations requiring constant use of the list of abbreviations.  In this work, being part of an encyclopaedia, the abbreviations are limited in number, and of non-technical words.  It is intended that when I have completed my work there will be little requirement for further editing, and where there is it does not require any more than a basic knowledge of English, and how to use an index of abbreviations in order to make sense of the article as all the relevant information should be contained therein.
[JohnArmagh]: I am currently re-thinking the issue of granges - I intend to make the inclusion on the same basis as that of hospitals and exclude any which did not function at one time as a monastery.  I am currently going through each monastic establishment, county by county using Hadcock & Knowles Medieval Religious Houses, which is a very lengthy process.

[JohnArmagh]: By all means, feel free.  (btw, I hope I don't offend, but I have put Bradley back, on the basis of the info from Knowles and Hadcock, and included a link to the online VCH - but I have unlinked the name on the basis that there is sufficient doubt about the nature of the establishment as to warrant an article on it to be unnecessary)"
Asad112,False,"[Asad112]: Could inform me of the new UN Security Council resolution that was passed in the last 24 hours, or some major shift in world view that went completely unnoticed by the world press to justify this edit?

[Asad112]: I would advise you to ignore Chesdovi's request. There was no basis for the change that he made originally. And what he provided you was a category not protocol, which is suppose to prove his point (how? I have no idea.) -
[Asad112]: I would suggest you self-revert your insertion of the \""nowadays\"" term in the [[Joseph's Tomb]] article that you twice reverted back within span of 10 hours. You are well aware of the 1RR. -
[Asad112]: I will be glad to self-revert if you could explain to me how my second edit was a second revert of something I previously reverted. -
[Asad112]: I deleted \""nowadays\"" in the first revert. And in the second edit, I changed \""nowadays\"" to \""recently\"" and added a citation tag. I only changed \""nowadays\"" to \""recently\"" as I feel \""recently\"" is a bit more proper. Go ahead and report me if you like, but I don't see any violation. -
[Asad112]: Perhaps you should go back and look at the revisions. I changed \""nowadays\"" to \""recently\"" (as I think it is a more proper word for an encyclopedia) and added a citation needed tag, as the BBC source, as you said, does not talk about \""nowadays\"" or \""recently\"" for that matter. It is pretty obvious that the if I believed in the edit strongly by adding \""recently\"" I would have not tagged with a citation needed. Seems like you are a bit confused. -
[Asad112]: I don't agree with adding \""recently\"" either. My main purpose of the edit was to add a citation need tag to your word. During the process of doing that, I thought changing it to \""recently\"" would be a more fitting word for an encyclopedia than \""nowadays\"". Get it yet? -
[Asad112]: So report me if you feel like it is necessary. I would gladly explain my side in such a case and accept whatever happens. Good luck. -
[Asad112]: Do you have any proof or evidence? Or are you just making an unsubstantiated claim? Where have I used profanity, what IPs have I hidden under?

[Asad112]: Thanks, that makes more sense. Also, thanks for the other information you added about the town, it is very interesting. I would just like to point out one thing though, I do not believe the source is correct in this [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Anabta&diff=434254904&oldid=434252601 edit]. To my knowledge, and many people in this town who are still alive and lived were alive in that 1931, there were never any Christians, Jewish or Druze. I have asked many people who's ancestor's who have come from Anabta for centuries and there were never people other than Muslims. I am pretty sure the source is wrong on this. What do you think? -

Neither of those things reflect badly on you personally, and if you feel in six months or so that you could use admin tools then I'd encourage you to go for it again, because everything I've seen suggests you'd be great at it - you just need to provide some more editing experience so people can be more sure of that.

TVArchivistUK,False,"[TVArchivistUK]: You've deleted a table\/list that I created a few weeks ago for recurring actors in the Australian soap. It seems you're determined to get rid of it and I can see an edit war developing between you and some editors. I created the list because all of the data contained was already in the main document. But it was becoming clumsy and not entirely pertinent to the chapters where it was contained. I appreciate that you may not approve of the list, but the number of editors who have contributed to it suggest that there is interest. Rather than simply deleting something you're not fond of, why not put the matter up for discussion? Gauge the reaction of other editors. I note that today you have said the list is unsourced. From what I can tell, almost nothing on this page is sourced at all, yet you have not deleted any other information. The \""Top Dog\"" list (which I consider highly irrelevant personally) is not sourced. None of the plot detail is sourced. I think all of the videos for this show exist on YouTube, so it would be very easy to link in all of the relevant closing credits. I'll happily do that when I have the time. For now, I think a discussion is more appropriate than deleting. Do you agree?
[TVArchivistUK]: I certainly agree that wiki should not be a fan site. I am not overly familiar with this show, so I can't really contribute to the rewriting of the article in general as I don't have enough information. But I don't think this particular list is either making it a fan site or a dumping ground. As I wrote, the data was already contained in the article, I simply wanted to clean it and make it more of a formal contribution. For such a short lived programme, it does seem of interest that so many actors returned in different roles, seemingly in some cases just weeks after their earlier character had appeared. I think it is better to rework the entire article to meet the necessary standards than to simply pick out individual sections. But I have no desire to enter an edit war. I value my contributions to wiki and I don't want to get embroiled in any dispute, let alone find myself banned, as seems to be the general modus operandus when minor disputes arise.

Jmfangio,False,"[Jmfangio]: I wish this person would compromise, but he will not compromise.  You an see his behavior continues [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Daunte_Culpepper&curid=870689&diff=146675820&oldid=146675594 here] and [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Daunte_Culpepper&diff=prev&oldid=146675820 here].  This has stemmed from [[User_talk:Jmfangio\/Template:NFLactive#Link_in_infobox|this]] discussion.  He has already asserted that he [[WP:OWN]]s these articles and even went so far as to tell a user that he wanted to do all the [[Miami Dolphins]] userboxes.  He has insulted me and violated a number of policies and guidelines.  I did not violate 3RR.  I went through articles and edited them to reflect a compromise that must be used to satisfy both sides of the issue.  He then engaged me in edit warring (not the other way around).  If you want me to go through dispute resolution, i will, but i don't think that's needed when he has brazenly asserted \""I have already proven why my way is correct, and if you can't get it then that's on you.\"" <small><span style=\""border:1px solid #0000ff;padding:1px;\"">
[Jmfangio]: I saw your comment on [[WT:CFB]] and thought you might be able to help me.  In my recent edits to wiki, i have openly tried to discuss topics.  Two of them are taking up an extreme amount of time (the CFB discussion and the [[User talk:Jmfangio\/Template:NFLactive|here]].  I'm very frustrated by the fact my edits, no matter how well supported by policy, guideline, and logical extension of those concepts, are focused on talk pages and not on the content of the articles.  I have been attacked, edit warred with, and very few of these people want to discuss this matter without injecting their \""opinions\"" as to what they \""like\"".  I have had to file a [[WP:30]] on the template issue, but I'm really frustrated by having to engage in arguments that go on for this long when the edits are supported by wikipedia on the whole.  Just to add: I'm happy to discuss this on your page or my page, which ever is easiest on you.  <small><span style=\""border:1px solid #0000ff;padding:1px;\"">
[Jmfangio]: I don't mind that you are against it.  What I upset about is people basically saying: I don't care what wiki documenation says - i like it this way (which is what most people are doing). I have opened up the discussion on the talk page for [[WP:UNI]] and give it some time there.  Some people have brought up some pretty good points for status quo.  It's not about \""winning\"" the argument. It's about having an argument that is well based on both sides.  The same thing is happening to another user at [[San Diego Chargers]].  And the crap that i've put up with from Chrisjnelson on the NFLactive page is down right ridiculous.  I am aware of other avenues (RFC, 3O, etc..etc..) but that requires me to \""jump\"" through hoops just to get anything done - and from my experiences with a lot of these process - they often result in little help.  I guess I'm just venting more than anything else. Be well and thanks for your response. <small><span style=\""border:1px solid #0000ff;padding:1px;\"">
[Jmfangio]: Hi there, I noticed that you were able to institute a page lock.  I am sorry for dumping this on you, but I recently requested that a page be temporarily locked as there is a user who I am in a dispute with.  Unfortunately, he doesn't seem to understand the ramifications of his edits to the template and his changes are messing with the display on a lot of pages.  I just need the thing locked as I am in violation of the 3RR because I consider this vandalism.  The request is [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia:Requests_for_page_protection#Template:Infobox_NFLactive_.28edit.7Ctalk.7Chistory.7Clinks.7Cwatch.7Clogs.29 here] and the actual template is {{tl|Infobox NFLactive}}. Please lock it to one of my versions so that the display is not messed up on the pages where the template is in use.  I know that is not \""supposed\"" to be part of the request, but this is a template and not a standard page.  Thanks much. <small><span style=\""border:1px solid #0000ff;padding:1px;\"">
[Jmfangio]: No appology necessary, the world will continue even if wiki blows up :-).  It is a hairy situation and I your willingness to help! <small><span style=\""border:1px solid #0000ff;padding:1px;\"">
[Jmfangio]: With regards the the general nature of my frustration: I set up a WikiAlert because of his incivility, nobody did a thing.  Some other editors have chimed in because of the alert, but they were only there \""unofficially\"", and did not really help to get the conversation moving forward again.  Next, I setup a 30. The person felt I had legitimate points, and advised me to open a RFC.  What happened with the RFC? Nothing. Not one single response [[Template_talk:Infobox_NFLactive#Request_for_Comment:Template_creation_and_implementation|here]].  Finally, I went to open RFM.  Not surprisingly, he and another one of his buddies (by their own admission) did not agree to mediation.  His buddy was the only one to \""officialy\"" respond.  Did he simply say disagree on the RFM page as is \""required\""?  No, he went on a diatribe (since reverted by another user).  What did this guy do?  remove the notice from his talk page (which is fine) with the note of vandalism (which it wasn't). Twice I have had to ask that the template page be locked (as it currently is).  And now people are saying that the onus is on me (AGAIN) to have this behavior looked into.  I'm supposed to go to arbitration and fill out more \""forms\"", and spend more of my time just trying to get someone to deal with the issue.  The only thing that has changed is that I am now not editing articles until this situation can be dealt with (voluntarily i might add).  I find this quote an ideal example of his attitude: \""I appreciate your effort, but I think I should have gotten someone with no real interest in football, because all I was looking for was someone to help me create the template I was envisioning.\""  He said that on 00:26 on the 23rd.  I'm frustrated as heck that I can't edit pages right now or discuss development of these infoboxes because of one user. <small><span style=\""border:1px solid #0000ff;padding:1px;\"">
[Jmfangio]: PS - I have marked this for watching, but if you'd rather keep this on my talk page, just refractor it and we'll talk there.  Calil said he felt like I was canvasing, so let me clarify something: I'm not asking anyone to agree with my \""perspective\"", I'm simply asking that someone step in so that a conversation based on the issues can take place without fear of personal attacks and article ownership coming into play. <small><span style=\""border:1px solid #0000ff;padding:1px;\"">
[Jmfangio]: Thanks for your note.  I would welcome anyone who wants to help get this thing unlocked and moving along then.  But I'm not sure how to proceed.  All I want is someone to take the reigns and try to get the situation to a point where both of us can co-exist.  I agree arbitration is really - REALLY - a last resort.  The dispute started over a template that has since been moved from my user space to the mainspace.  You can view the template (and thus it's talk page at {{tl:Infobox NFLactive}}.  The early history is lost because of my own mistake (I merged via copy when I shouldn't have). But the time stamps should give you an idea of how things progressed.  I will tell you that many of the \""sub-sections\"" are all \""continuing\"" conversations.   I will give you whatever information you would like.  <small><span style=\""border:1px solid #0000ff;padding:1px;\"">
[Jmfangio]: If you are around, it would be great if you could step in and ask that {{user|B}} (an admin) and {{user|Chrisjnelson}} stop.  {{user|B}} stepped in to fix something that was not disputed.  He had already expressed similar feelings to Chrisjnelson.  Chrisjnelson continues to go to others and ask them to make changes simply to circumvent the template protection.  He is not even doing it with the {{tl|editprotected}} tag.  I just want this to stop until reasonable discussion takes places. <small><span style=\""border:1px solid #0000ff;padding:1px;\"">
[Jmfangio]: Yes but just to make clear - here is what I'm hoping for: Incivility to stop.  For people who claim [[WP:OWN|ownership]], that their behavior be addressed.  And that we allow for each issue to be addressed individually and not take on 30 different issues at a time. <small><span style=\""border:1px solid #0000ff;padding:1px;\"">
[Jmfangio]: I have to say I'm somewhat disappointed.  He is now onto calling me a lunatic, mentally unstable, and \""off the reservation\"".  That is ridiculous.  You wonder why I attacked him?  Because he lays into this stuff and nobody does a thing about it.  Per one of your statements: I don't think I'm right and that he's wrong.  What I have said all along is that there are at least two perspectives and both have legitimate \""arguments\"".  The solution was to have an impartial display of information.  I would welcome any solution that does not allow for edit warring.  He got uncivil with me, and no matter how polite I was it has continued unchecked.  That is really just disgusting.  I will be happy to point you to said examples and show you how this thing is really easy to solve.  The reality of the situation is that this user goes around asking people to make edits to things he can't edit.  Many times, they are unaware.  You might want to take a look through [[Template Talk:Infobox NFL player#jersey numbers]] to see how this attitude that he carries around has been expressed before.  He keeps saying how I don't understand the policies and guidelines I cite.  Yet he goes and says that he's going to do what he wants, when he wants.  I have gone so far as to essentially stop content editing (sans a few minor ones), and yet you are not getting his behavior to stop.  Why again is the onus back on me with no support from the community?  I'm not asking for people to agree with me, I'm asking people to get this guy off my back. <small><span style=\""border:1px solid #0000ff;padding:1px;\"">
[Jmfangio]: '''NOTICE''' This is absolutely just childish.  He has now started to make disputed edits at [[Brett Favre]].  I will gladly report this as a violation of 3RR as it is against the spirit of the rule.  He knows very well that this is disputed and despite my numerous attempts to discuss these matters civily, he refuses to do so.  How this can be allowed to happen is beyond me.  Please let me know if there is anything you feel should be done.  If not, I will be forced to continue this debacle without the assistance of others.<small><span style=\""border:1px solid #0000ff;padding:1px;\"">
[Jmfangio]: I have now requested page protection and am now filing a 3RR.  I am happy to talk about this peacefully, but you have attacked me more times than I account.

[Jmfangio]: See your talk page, this is not the place.  <small><span style=\""border:1px solid #0000ff;padding:1px;\"">
[Jmfangio]: I am not sure exactly why Navou took the case when he didn't really want to put any effort into this.  The opening line from CEM states that the goal is \""to address persistent conflicts between established editors where content disputes include user conduct elements.\""  He then asked to have the conduct elements left out (in part because of Chrisjnelson), and then he closes the case without putting in any real effort.  Is arbitration my only course of action? <small><span style=\""border:1px solid #0000ff;padding:1px;\"">
[Jmfangio]: Because you asked to have your behavior \""left out of the discussion\"".  (I conditionally agreed to provided certain conditions, but those conditions were neither accepted nor refused. <small><span style=\""border:1px solid #0000ff;padding:1px;\"">
[Jmfangio]: I hear ya.  Every time someone chimes in though it seems that they agree a neutral solution is needed (as mine is), but nobody wants to step in and get this guy to stop making ownership-like statements.  He continues to drift toward making personal attacks as he sees fit. I filed a [[WP:ANI]] and nobody did anything. <small><span style=\""border:1px solid #0000ff;padding:1px;\"">

[Jmfangio]: The new format *should* not require the nowrap, but just in case i'm missing something - is it causing you problems.  If you go to edit the template - you'll see the color (which is for the background color of the bar) and the fontcolor fields (for the color of the text that isn't wikilinked).  You can use whatever [[web colors]] you want there, but just keep in mind that there are some usability standards (i can dig them up) and some people might react to the color being changed (it's a HUGE debate on other sports templates for example).  Alright, I'm definitely out, but i'll be back to help later. <small><span style=\""border:1px solid #0000ff;padding:1px;\"">
[Jmfangio]: I saw your outside, i would agree with most of it, although there is a \""disclosure\"" section there which I fully admitted that after weeks of this, I did bite back.  That should amount to something.  I made a comment on the talk page, I'd welcome further input. I'm fully willing to take responsibility for my actions; the problem is, others are not and everyone seems to want to be slow to deal with this more aggressively.  <small><span style=\""border:1px solid #0000ff;padding:1px;\"">
[Jmfangio]: Now there ya go! Good job on the no wrap.  Have you thought about creating one of these templates in your user space as a sandbox!  Really nice job.  Let me know if you want some more help or if you want to talk about any of this stuff! <small><span style=\""border:1px solid #0000ff;padding:1px;\"">
[Jmfangio]: Haha, hang in there.  People love to template out pages, I personally thing it's ba-aaaad.  But whatever.  The purpose of sanboxing anything is that you can work on it until your hearts desire and you won't really be affecting anyone else.  You can \""workout\"" all the issues you have and then open up the content to interested users.  I have done this many times and it's a great way to start things.  The only thing you need to be careful is with the category tags.  In a sandbox you should use (for example: <nowiki>[[:Category:Super cool people]]<\/nowiki>).  Once it's live you should use <nowiki>[[Category:Super cool people]]<\/nowiki>  This way, the category isn't inundated with pages that don't really belong.  Does that make sense?  Have you looked at [[Help:Template]] yet?  I'm not super great, but i'm doing pretty good with my template development.  There are a couple of guys who are super helpful and freakin awesome, I'll be glad to get them to help if there is something i can't answer for you. <small><span style=\""border:1px solid #0000ff;padding:1px;\"">
[Jmfangio]: Bout to eat dinner, but i'll be back later... you can also look at nesting the content as well. That might work out as well. <small><span style=\""border:1px solid #0000ff;padding:1px;\"">
[Jmfangio]: How goes with everything? <small><span style=\""border:1px solid #0000ff;padding:1px;\"">

[Jmfangio]: CSD will be removed.  It sounds like this is not a deletion issue but a disambig issue, so we should focus on that aspect of the information.

[Jmfangio]: You voted not to hear it because there was no RFC.  An RFC was opened and it has just been closed [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment\/Chrisjnelson]]. I hope that this will allow the ArbCom to take this up. <small><span style=\""border:1px solid #0000ff;padding:1px;\"">

[Jmfangio]: One quick question - on the ArbCom you said that I mentioned that i would revert Chris' edits unilaterally.  I believe that this is something that I did clarify my position on shortly thereafter.  I will gladly point you to the diff link, but I think it is important that the context is given.  If you believe this to be the case (either before or after looking at the difference link) would you amend that statement?<small><span style=\""border:1px solid #0000ff;padding:1px;\"">
[Jmfangio]: I asked this of durova, but felt it wouldn't hurt to get another opinion.  As you are versed on the situation, I will present this here.  If you feel there is a COI, please let me know.  During one of my suspensions, my opinion (which was already expressed) was directly circumvented. I think that's bad form. So how do we balance the need to keep a user's opinion in consideration while they are unable to edit? Even if their opinions are eventually put to the side - I don't want to simply go back and adjust all the contentious edits - even with support - unless I know that is acceptable.  It appears that other's share my same concerns as to how to deal with a \""suspended\"" users input. I will also put this on [[WT:BLOCK]], as it will probably be a good thing to include on the article page. <small><span style=\""border:1px solid #0000ff;padding:1px;\"">"
AberforthD,False,"[AberforthD]: I think we differ in our assessment of verifiability. Yahoo Movies give a comprehensive list of the complete crew involved in the film Order of the Phoenix. Their site is not edited by individual contributors as far as I know. Please correct me if I'm wrong. If they can list the names of all crew-memebers, why would the voice-actor of Kreacher be seen as not verifiable? Only because it is not an official source?
[AberforthD]: Thanks for the explanations Edel. I can see your point. And as you rightfully say, the problem will be solved in 4 days anyway. However, I think that your being \""nitpicky\"" as you call it yourself has more general implications beyond this article. We had a similar issue for the Brittish edition of the book \""Deathly Hallows\"" where the page count of 608 rose suspicion because it is exactly the same as the previous book \""Order of the Phoenix\"". People thought it was a copy\/paste error by the book sellers (most notably amazon.co.uk) and the editor Bloomsbury never issued an official pagecount, unless we have to believe second hand information from people who say they have confirmed with Bloomsbury. So it was decided for that article to say the book is EXPECTED to be 608 pages. The policy you follow at the moment doesn't mention anything at all, even though there are indications the information might be correct. Why can't Kreacher be listed as a non-human character while stating that the voice actor is EXPECTED to be this or that person?"

Unfortunately there's no way to really grasp the norms here without making a ton of mistakes (which he is doing) and learning from them (and a double-check here).  You know what I'd expect to help?  A block.  Seriously, blocks have a wonderful way of clarifying things and slowing down editing, and I continuously thank William M. Connolley (mentally) for my first one.  I don't think anyone should be ashamed of their first block (it's when you get to your third, 100% justified block, that the community should worry.  I'm on my third, completely justified block; 4th if you want to be a stickler).  WAID has a clean block log, as does PPdd.  Good for them, particularly with WAID's 47K of edits."

As for Caliacra and \u015eabla: if someone read in a book written before 1940 about \""Caliacra\"", and wanted to search it in wiki, he wouldn't find it. But if the romanian rendition would be presentin the article, the search engine would find the \""Kaliakra\"" article.
[Anonimu]: Using \""ch\"" instead of \""ce\"" is like using \""\u015f\"" instead of \""sh\"". It's just the final \""o\"". ( \""harsovo\"" is not standard transliteration, so the \""a\"" isn't really an a, but a sound pretty close to  romanian \""\xee\/\xe2\"")
[Anonimu]: About Harsova, here's what i could find: \""H\xc2RSOVO - grad v Severna Dobrudja, na lebiya bryag na r. Dunav, dnes v Rum\xe2nya. P\xe2rvoto sigurno slomenavane na toyi grad e v geografska karta ot 1507 g. Spored ocmanski dokument ot 16 vek e vilaet, prinadlejasht k\xe2m Silistrenski sandjak.  '''Priema se, che imeto mu proizliza ot \""lichnoto ime H\xe2rs ili Hr\xe2s'''\"". \""(sorry for the lame transliteration, but it took to long to write in cyrillic)Unfortunately this doesn't say the exact first mention. Romanian linguist Sorin Olteanu also thinks it comes from \""H\xe2rs\""\/\""H\xe2r\u015f\""(someone's name)+ ova (turkish for \""field\"").
[Anonimu]: The relation between Dacians and other supergroups such as Germanics, Baltics or Slavs is actually uncharted territory, given the paucity of samples of the language spoken by them. The words we have indicate PIE roots that are mostly found in Baltic or Slavic, but the scholars are agnostic about the relation between Dacians (or Thracians) and those groups. Also, according to [[Florin Curta]]'s research about the \""making of Slavs\"", which received a lot of positive reviews, Slavs as a cultural group appeared mainly in the 6th century under the influence of the Byzantine Empire - and the region where this \""making\"" was done was exactly the low regions of Wallachia and Moldavia, ''suggesting that some local groups arguably descending from the Getae took part in the cultural genesis of Slavs'' (italics represent my understanding, this idea is not explicitly expressed by Curta).
[Anonimu]: About the diacritics: as long [[Operating_system_usage|40% of Internet users]] use an [[Windows XP|operating system]] that [[S-comma|doesn't natively]] [[T-comma|support]] those letters, I strongly disagree with a universal move from t\/s-cedilla towards t\/s-comma. While on ro.wp we can assume most readers installed the necessary software, this isn't the case for the international readership of en.wp. And a t\/s-cedilla is always better than a blank square."

Zlerman,False,"[Zlerman]: Dear Number57: I am so glad that someone has looked at my piece on [[Moshav shitufi]]. Writing it was not premeditated: I wrote it today on the spur of the moment because I felt there was a definite lack of clarity between ''moshav'' (i.e., ''moshav ovdim'') and ''moshav shitufi'' -- which is a totally different brand of animal. I do not think we need a separate, new article on [[moshav ovdim]]. In Hebrew, when we say \""moshav\"", we automatically mean \""moshav ovdim\"", so perhaps the existing article [[moshav]] should be edited a little to stress that it deals with ''moshav ovdim'' and to differentiate more sharply between the two types of moshavim. Let me know what you think. And how come an English Wikipedian from Suffolk is interested in such abstruse Israeliana? Regards, --
[Zlerman]: I will see what I can do with the existing [[moshav]] article, taking the Hebrew version and your suggestions into account. I will keep you posted on this. As to your Turkmenistan-oriented friend, you can refer him\/her to my web site: there is a lot of interesting stuff on Turkmen agriculture there (in English and in Russian). Best, --
[Zlerman]: I have drawn up a list of all 40 moshavim shitufiim in Israel (from Registrar's site) and checked it against ''Category:Moshavim'' and ''List of moshavim'' in [[Moshav]]. Many moshavim shitufiim appear in the ''Category'' and do not appear in the ''List''; many do not appear in either. If you are interested in my list (with the classification), I will be pleased to send it to you by e-mail. --
[Zlerman]: Please go to the brand new [[List of moshavim shitufiim]] and tell me what you think. --
[Zlerman]: Yes, this is what the \""comments\"" column is for. All the moshavim in the list are registered as shitufiim with the Registrar (see the web site I sent you earlier today). However, the situation is highly dynamic, and even those that are formally registered as moshavim shitufiim may in fact operate like \""communal settlements\"". We need to check and filter all this. --
[Zlerman]: Thank you for correcting my malplaced disambiguation \""Surxondaryo redirects to Surxondaryo (disambiguation)\"" (19 July 2008, 12:10). I am personally responsible for at least four more such bloopers: (1) Collectivization redirects to Collectivization (disambiguation); (2) Decollectivization redirects to Decollectivization (disambiguation); (3) Vahdat redirects to Vahdat (disambiguation); and (4) Zaamin redirects to Zaamin (disambiguation). If it is not too much trouble, please correct all four of them when you get a chance. Now that I am aware of the problem, I will do my best to avoid malplaced disambiguations in the future. --
[Zlerman]: I am writing about what I regard as confusion with the article on Central Asian dumplings [[manty]]. The main article [[Mant\u0131]] is named in such a way that it cannot be reached from a standard English keyboard. The two disambiguation pages, [[Manty]] and [[Manti]], look circuitous and confusing. Since a normal English speaker would generally look for this (fairly common) dumpling by typing \""manty\"" (or less frequently \""manti\""), I suggest that the main article be moved from the \""untypable\"" [[Mant\u0131]] to ''Manty'' with proper redirects and disambigs added. If you agree, perhaps you could exercise your authority and implement the renaming. Even if you do not wish to move [[Mant\u0131]] to ''Manty'', you may still agree that the two disambig pages should be cleaned up. --
[Zlerman]: I agree entirely. However, meze is mentioned explicitly on [[Cuisine of Armenia]] and that's why I think we need to tag it with ''Category:Armenian cuisine''. I have put a lot of effort into editing and revising [[Cuisine of Armenia]] (although I am not Armenian and eat Armenian food only when I visit Yerevan). I am aware of the suggestion on the talk page to separate explicitly between typical Armenian dishes, Western Armenian dishes, and other cuisines, but as I have noted previously I am not qualified to do that. I have to leave this to Armenian food experts. Perhaps we should tag as Armenian cuisine only those specific dishes that are listed in [[Cuisine of Armenia]]. But we now have a further complication: [[User:Hakob|Hakob]] has created a new ''Category:Western Armenian cuisine'' and has been implementing two kinds of edits across the board: either replacing ''Category:Armenian cuisine'' with ''Category:Western Armenian cuisine'' or adding ''Category:Western Armenian cuisine'' to ''Category:Armenian cuisine''. The latter is totally objectionable, because ''Category:Western Armenian cuisine'' is included in ''Category:Armenian cuisine''. The former is problematic, because how can we be absolutely sure that a dish is \""Western\"" Armenian and not (also) \""Eastern\"" Armenian? This problem has cropped up with [[manti]] and now with [[meze]]. We can probably be sure about [[fattoush]], [[hummus]], and [[tabuleh]] (all Western Armenian?), but what about [[eetch]] -- as of now it is in ''Category:Western Armenian cuisine'' only. So these are the problems as I see them. Please study the [[Cuisine of Armenia]] article and review the lists of dishes in the two categories. I look forward to hearing your views, here, on [[User talk:Zlerman|my talk page]], or on [[Talk:Cuisine of Armenia|Cuisine of Armenia talk page]]. We should certainly make an effort to straighten this out in a constructive manner. --
[Zlerman]: [[User:67.80.174.252]], your language (here and in your edit comments) is untenable. Please observe [[WP:Civility]]. Do not delete sourced material.

[Zlerman]: Hi, we have three instances of Ghafurov (all in Tajikistan): [[Ghafurov]], the town; [[Ghafurov district]]; and [[Bobojon Ghafurov]], the historian. I thought of moving Ghafurov to a new page, Ghafurov (town), and creating a three-way disambig switch under Ghafurov. But I have noticed that you like to check incoming link frequencies before disambiguating. I don't know how to do that, so could you please check the link frequencies for these three pages and advise me on the best disambiguation scheme? Many thanks. --
[Zlerman]: Thanks for your tremendous help. I think I will first try approach 1 as less \""invasive\"". Regards, --
[Zlerman]: Please visit [[Moscow Peak]] and see if there is a good way of disambiguating the three peaks: the main (and most notable) giant in Tajikistan and the two smaller (and much less notable) ones in Arizona and Victoria. Bear in mind that there are no articles on the peaks in Arizona and Victoria and I doubt that they will ever be written (neither passes the notability test). Your advice will be much appreciated. Thanks. --
[Zlerman]: Your changes (Oghi to Aragh) in [[Armenian cuisine#Drinks]] seem to contradict the sources that I have found (as cited in the article). Your description of oghi as an aniseed-flavored drink seems to contradict previous comments that I have received from other users. Earlier today I requested a second opinion from [[User:Eupator]] on the subject of both oghi and aragh. I would like to wait for his reply and meanwhile I am reverting your edits -- to enable him to see my original version. I would very much appreciate your input on these issues, but in more detail please: either on [[Talk:Armenian cuisine]] or on [[User talk:Zlerman|my talk page]]. My apologies for temporarily reverting your edits. Thank you for your understanding. --

In dealing with pogroms, Kozhinov makes a point in using mostly jewish sources, and from those he derives that the jewish self-defence(1) against \""pogromshchiki\"" was more succesful than is usually admitted, as well as that the government's role to suppress the anti-semitic riots has been largely underplayed in modern historiography.

[Ebyabe]: True, the history folks should know. The Willis Store address could be wrong (wouldn't be surprised if it was really 2960, or 2296). Or it could have been demolished, which has happened to a number of places on the list. Registry isn't a guarantee of preservation, sadly.  -
[Ebyabe]: To make it easier for all of us to keep track, I made a list of the RHPs here needing pix, at [[User:Ebyabe\/NRHPs in FL pix needed]]. Plus they can be sectioned further there, for travel arranging. I'll add state parks in a while, 'cause if one's in the area of some RHPs, why not? Plus some are RHPs in their own right (like [[Torreya State Park|Torreya]]). --
[Ebyabe]: Update away, it's all good. :) --
[Ebyabe]: Thanks for the tweaks on [[De Leon Springs State Park|De Leon Springs]] and [[Torreya State Park|Torreya]]; muchly improved. :) --
[Ebyabe]: As far as gov't sources \""copyvio\"", I think since it's usually public domain, it's not really copyvio. Though I like to at least rearrange things a bit anyway, just in case and for aesthetics. Of course, I mostly do stubs so I don't have to worry about that sort of thing. In the time it would take me to do a decent article, I can create dozens of stubs. I believe in quantity over quality. Though even my quantities need to have a minumum level of quality, doncha know.  :) --
[Ebyabe]: SIDENOTE: You might wanna consider archiving this page. I broke down finally and got one of the bots that does it automatically to do mine. Check [[User:MiszaBot III]], if you're interested. :) --
[Ebyabe]: Oh, on a sidenote, have you considered getting a bot to archive for you? I liked doing it myself, but I finally realized, \""Why do it manually, when you can save time having it done automatically?\"" I tried [[User:MiszaBot III]], and it's worked fine. Just an FYI. :) --
[Ebyabe]: Gee, and people wonder why I'm against [[:Category:Wikipedians against anonymous editing|anonymous editing]]. *heavy sigh* --
[Ebyabe]: After being warned following your user page vandalization, the little imp continue on its merry way, as evidenced [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Special:Contributions\/209.31.114.106 here]. I reverted the first couple, but methinks it needs blockage? Yep, and he vandalized your userpage ''again.'' --
[Ebyabe]: Never mind, [[User:KirinX|KirinX]] got it. :) --
[Ebyabe]: To [[White Springs, Florida|White Springs]] and [[Welaka, Florida|Welaka]], that is. I was doing them for the [[WP:NRHP|NRHP]] Wikiproject, but I guess they could be used as well for the cities. I didn't add any to Fort Cooper 'cause... I think I forgot. Thanks again! :) --
[Ebyabe]: Hey, there's bucketloads more where that came from. See [[Commons:Category:Registered Historic Places in Florida]]. I'm trying to get pics of every site in Florida, and there's folks in other parts of the state helping, so it ain't just me. I keep track of what's left to do [[User:Ebyabe\/NRHPs in FL pix needed|here]]. Have fun! --
[Ebyabe]: The search function isn't always that great on the commons. That's why I categorize the hell out of any pics I add. You'll see what I mean if you go to the category I mentioned above. I even subsectioned it by county, and in some cases city. Thanks for reminding me of something, btw. I did a major reorg of my galleries, and I don't think I put the userpage category at the bottom of all the new pages. Oh well, something else to do. If you need any advice on using the commons though, drop me a line, and I can share what meager bits I've managed to gather. Cheerio! --
[Ebyabe]: Click on the \""Commons\"" link above; it should take you right there. --
[Ebyabe]: Hey folks. It appears this is what's known as a [[contributing property]] to the [[St. Anthony Falls Historic District]]. Essentially, it's one of the buildings in the district that makes it an historic district. Sometimes individual properties within a district are listed separately on the National Register, but most aren't. It always bugs me when I see a plaque on a building saying it's listed on the Register when it's actually part of a district. Believe me, I've seen it more than once. Anyhoo, hope this info helps. :) --
[Ebyabe]: Whaddya think about semi-protecting at least some of the pages the liebmanites are changing. It would at least reduce the anonymous IP stuff. Then he\/she\/it would have to waste time creating sockpuppets to continue his\/her\/their vandalims. Or not. Simply a random idea. It helped for [[Knight]]. --
[Ebyabe]: There is a certain amusement value to see the depth of the hole he'll wind up digging for himself. He's writing a book, you say? Gosh, if he spent less time here and more on the book, ya think it might have gotten to the printers, instead of still being a work in progress? Hey, I'm just sayin'. ;) -
[Ebyabe]: Well, I can do it all day, but I shouldn't, 'cause I do have better things to do, doncha know. Thanks for the protect on [[Victor Pellot]]. As you can see, he used two anonymous IPs and a sockpuppet today alone. I think he's going to get worse, the more people get involved, and the more frustrated he gets. Appreciations for your involvement, and hope things are well for you otherwise. :) --
[Ebyabe]: I can understand. I'm trying to upload pics from my sojourn around the Orlando area, and am being sidetracked constantly having to report Ronnie's sockpuppets. Oh well... :) -
[Ebyabe]: Thanks for the blocks on the Ron socks. Another one has cropped up, [[Special:Contributions\/149.4.108.72]]. I've alerted [[User_talk:Netsnipe#Ron_liebman_strikes_again|Netsnipe]], who has previously done a range block. If you can do so, that would be loverly. If not, we can wait for Netsnipe to do so. [[Welcome to the Jungle|Welcome back to the jungle]]! ;) -
[Ebyabe]: He's been keeping it on the down-low recently. Which is good, less to revert. He seems to be diversifying, doing a few edits on several different accounts. He must think that'll fool us somehow. Not so long as his behaviour (the edits, the style of his abusive edit summaries) remains the same. I've tried to explain that, but it's like talking to a dead horse. Or riding a wall into the ground. Did you get that I'm not good with the whole metaphor thing? *hehe* Anyway, I'll keep an eye out and report his offenses, and not let myself get provoked by him. B\/c that way, he wins. It seems like at this point, it's all about who'll outlast whom. Dunno about him, but I can do this for a very long time. We shall see... -
[Ebyabe]: Oh, [[Special:Contributions\/149.4.108.72]] is getting snippy with [[User:Momusufan|Momusufan]]. How predictable. *sigh* -
[Ebyabe]: That is, adding the newer listings. I'd meant to add the ones for Florida, but missed the ones you added, so danke for that too. Yours truly, the All-Seeing NRHP Eye. :) -
[Ebyabe]: Hey dude. Could you do me a small favor, no hurry, when you get a chance? Please look at [[Special:Contributions\/Vermont120]]. They're link-only additions, and the link is to an online magazine and video. I'm not sure if these would qualify as useful (like linking to a USA Today article), or as linkspam. Just want some rationale if I try to delete the links again. Thanks! -
[Ebyabe]: Good enough. Was leaning that way, but needed a second opinion. Off to delete. Thanks! :) -
[Ebyabe]: Hey, is [[Talk:Television (A Disney Channel Original Movie)|this page]] appropriate? Especially since it was created by an anonymous IP, who also added the \""protected\"" part. Danke. :) --
[Ebyabe]: Is there any way you could put a semi-protect on his article, like only for a day or two. This whole Opie and Anthony show thing is getting out of hand. Wouldn't be surprised if partisans of the show (whatever it is) are doing it as a bizarre publicity stunt. Any help would be muchly appreciated. :) -
[Ebyabe]: Hey, I went ahead and put a request in at [[WP:RFP]], as whoever it is appears to still be at it. *sigh* -
[Ebyabe]: That's cool. I have a funny feeling the vandalism was something along the lines of when [[Steven Colbert]] makes Wikipedia references. Probably some wacky morning show somewhere that thought it'd be a goof to encourage people to vandalize the Scott article. Who can figure? Anyhoo, thanks, and welcome home! :) -
[Ebyabe]: Don't forget to say hi to [[User talk:Danielle blair|Danielle]], like you did to [[User talk:Bernard okun|Bernard]]. That's Danielle, not to be confused with [[User talk:Daniella blair|Daniella]]. The names, he's gotten so creative. Or, to paraphrase [[Austin Powers|a wise man]], \""Danielle, you're a man, baby!\"" :) -
[Ebyabe]: Thanks. And btw, sent you an offline e-mail. What, there's life outside Wikipedia??? *lol* -
[Ebyabe]: I think [[Special:Contributions\/ChadsPlace|ChadsPlace]] might be him, but amn't 100% sure, but wanted to let you know. -
[Ebyabe]: And check [[User_talk:Herb_gecht|this]]. Now he's using ''square'' brackets! -
[Ebyabe]: Might it be best to just block \""Herb's\"" talk page? Or let him continue making failed unblock requests? -
[Ebyabe]: And [[User talk:Bernard okun|Bernard]] hasn't learned either. *sigh* -
[Ebyabe]: I reported to [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard\/Incidents#New_Ron_liebman_sockpuppets ANI], b\/c [[WP:AIV]] said it wasn't their department. But he's got another one that we didn't notice that you're dealing with? Geezly! Thanks, though, and smiles be upon you. :) -
[Ebyabe]: I completely missed Paul. As far as Chad, the edit summaries are the same tone, too. Can you have a checkuser done? However it goes, I shan't undo any more of Chad's today, to not exceed 3RR. Maybe it doesn't count with vandalism, but I'd rather play it safe, especially after getting carried away with [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Don_Drysdale&action=history this one]. Thanks again. :) -
[Ebyabe]: And this one's likely. [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Special:Contributions\/PizzaDeluxe] Not baseball, but a couple of his socks made this edit repeatedly a few days ago. -
[Ebyabe]: He just doesn't seem to learn, sadly... [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Special:Contributions\/Caragliano] --
[Ebyabe]: This may be another one [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Special:Contributions\/Tinker-Evers-Chance], but I'm not sure. -
[Ebyabe]: (responding to Wknight94) That's okee-dokee. But your talk page was getting so long, I couldn't stop myself! *lol* Sorry I wasn't more clear about Caragliano\/caragliano. I do think it's bizarrely funny he created a sock to edit another sock, even though he said the first sock said he was never going to edit Wikipedia again. I don't know why he reminds me of [[Monk (TV series)|a certain TV character]]... :) -
[Ebyabe]: Guess who's back? [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Special:Contributions\/Vitamin_Shoppe] --
[Ebyabe]: Yeah, it's the [[User:Mike caragliano]] thing again. Probably should just have the user page and talk page of that account blocked. So he can find some other avenue to vent. Never a dull mo', eh? :) --
[Ebyabe]: Probably the paranoia talking. More proof that it's him, he's bringing up his favorite \""Is there an agenda?\"" thing. Wonder if he believes that the world's run by [[Illuminati|these folks]] thru [[Trilateral Commission|this organization]]. Must be a scary world he lives in. But you know what they say. Paranoids don't live longer, it just seems that way to them. Oh well... --
[Ebyabe]: I second that emotion. Third it, even. :) Yep, the burden of proof is on him to provide citations, not us to check if he's right or not. That would be the [[WP:CIVIL|civil]] thing to do. I'm still going with [[Monk (TV series)|this theory]]... -
[Ebyabe]: Got [[WP:ANI]] to indef block this one. Wasn't sure, as occassionally they've said they don't do sockpuppets. But usually they realize the problem and do the right thing, as they did in this case. Oh, I also have [[Sybil (book)|another theory]] to explain Ron. Based sheerly on observation of behaviour, of course. Funny, yet in a sad way. :( -
[Ebyabe]: This one's iffy [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Special:Contributions\/Edison_mathews], but thought I'd bring it to your attention to keep an eye on. Mostly it's the style of the user name, and that the \""citation\"" is in the edit summary. -
[Ebyabe]: Oh, and the questionable spelling. -
[Ebyabe]: This one has some of the flavour of his style. [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Special:Contributions\/Nippy_jones] -
[Ebyabe]: And look what [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Special:Contributions\/149.4.110.133 this anonymous IP] was doing. I guess since the Mike caragliano id is blocked... --
[Ebyabe]: I'm back, and whilst I was out, I see Liebby was busy. A few that may have been missed: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Special:Contributions\/April_fucito] [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Special:Contributions\/Tiger_Fan_Club], as well as one of his old vanity edits [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Special:Contributions\/David_the_raven]. -
[Ebyabe]: Another one[http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Special:Contributions\/Detroit_Alumni_Group]. -
[Ebyabe]: Also these two: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Special:Contributions\/149.4.108.120][http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Special:Contributions\/Mr._Friskie] -
[Ebyabe]: Ron socks. Maybe he's giving up on the baseball stuff, and seeing if he can get other stuff snuck through. But this whole bezzler thing, jeez! The only mention of the word I find on Wikipedia is in the [[Nodwick]] article, another non-baseball one that some of his socks have added to. Has someone been upping his daily dosage of [[The City on the Edge of Forever|cordrazine]]? --
[Ebyabe]: I was just going to bring that up. Isn't it amazing how he actually leads us to his other socks? It's like the guy recently who held up a bank, and wrote the holdup note on the back of his own pay-stub! Like a wise man once said, \""[[Darwin Awards|Stupid is as stupid does]].\"" -
[Ebyabe]: I'm going to say it, and [[WP:AGF|assume good faith]] be damned, but he's gone seriously mental today. Or, to paraphrase from a [[The Breakfast Club|great movie]], \""he's demented and sad, but asocial.\"" -
[Ebyabe]: He's at it again, on the [[Talk:Sex organ]] page. See the history [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Special:Contributions\/Ike_%26_Dick here]. *sigh* --
[Ebyabe]: A couple more that are likely ones [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Special:Contributions\/Internet_search_engines] [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Special:Contributions\/Jocelyn_Castillo]. Looks like he's learning to capitalize the last names. :) -
[Ebyabe]: Oh look [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Special:Contributions\/Forward_passes]. One created just to complain about all the evil people reverting the sock edits. :( -
[Ebyabe]: Probable ones, at least. I leave for you to judge, sir. [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Special:Contributions\/Educational_toys] [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Special:Contributions\/Supersede] -
[Ebyabe]: Here's [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Special:Contributions\/Klippstein another one], I believe. And to quote [[Zaphod Beeblebrox|Zaphod]] after meeting [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker%27s Guide to the Galaxy#The Ruler of the Universe|the Man in the Shack]], \""Oh, that clears it up; he's a weirdo.\"" :) -
[Ebyabe]: And I hate to think he's a [[Dungeons & Dragons|D&D]] fan, but the only reference I can find to that term is in [[Nodwick]]. Go figure... -
[Ebyabe]: Could you do me a wee favor and remove the tlx-es from his unblock requests, so they work proper? I'd do it, but thought maybe it was more an admin thing to do. You needn't consider his request (which I think should be totally denied, imho), just make it so that it can be considered. Thanks! :) -
[Ebyabe]: Thanks. I should have explained it's that his main [[User:Dethzone|user page]] is protected, b\/c he keeps using it like a Myspace page. He puts infoboxes for bands and non-fair use stuff there. Even says he's going to update it once a week like some kind of live journal. He's been blocked, but resumes once unblocked. I don't know if he's acting \""cool\"" (the \""Rawk on\"" stuff) of if he's a tween (amongst his favorite shows are [[Zoey 101]] and [[Drake & Josh]]). Again, danke. :) -
[Ebyabe]: Ooh, he's [http:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Ebyabe&diff=9558826&oldid=8712489 figured it out]. Don't worry, I've reported him over there. Just thought you'd be amused. Or saddened... -
[Ebyabe]: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Special:Contributions\/Wcfirm This user] keeps adding a website to [[Channing Tatum]], claiming it's official. And adding a section in the article essentially advertising the website. He doesn't seem to care about 3RR either. Zappit? :) -
[Ebyabe]: Oh, and you only need single brackets for the http ones. I know, confuses me, too. :) P.S. See below, if you've not already. -
[Ebyabe]: Thanks for the help. He's starting to remind me of Ron now, what with creating the sockpuppet. But with a ''reeeeeally'' narrow focus. Oh well... :) -
[Ebyabe]: And thanks for dealing with [[User:Hahahalcw|the new sock]]. I was going to report it, but you got to it first. If this keeps up, the \""official site\"" might get blacklisted. Especially since all the evidence he gives as to its legitimacy is not from reliable sources. I mean, IMDB & Myspace? I suspect that this guy is going to keep at it, though. Anyhoo, danke again. :) -
[Ebyabe]: Reported this to [[WP:UAA]], since it came from [[User:Mr. Ebyabe|Mr. Ebyabe]], not me. -
[Ebyabe]: Just jumping in here. I can find it there. The NRHP refnum is 72000640. Try [http:\/\/www.nr.nps.gov\/iwisapi\/explorer.dll?IWS_SCHEMA=NRIS1&IWS_LOGIN=1&IWS_REPORT=100000044 this link], enter \""MI\"" for the state code, and \""Ramsdell\"" in the name section. It's true, though, that sometimes the database can be squirrelly. Hope this helps. :) --
[Ebyabe]: Just jumping in here. I can find it there. The NRHP refnum is 72000640. Try [http:\/\/www.nr.nps.gov\/iwisapi\/explorer.dll?IWS_SCHEMA=NRIS1&IWS_LOGIN=1&IWS_REPORT=100000044 this link], enter \""MI\"" for the state code, and \""Ramsdell\"" in the name section. It's true, though, that sometimes the database can be squirrelly. Hope this helps. :) --
[Ebyabe]: Admittedly funny, but inappropriate for here. It started out around the beginning of this month, with [[Special:Contributions\/Fistsofham|Fistsofham]]. Now it's also coming from various IPs. I think it's likely the same person. It's low level vandalism, but annoying and repetitive. I was hoping there might be a way of blocking the word ''Cylon'' from being added to the article. Probably a vain hope, but thought I'd ask. Thanks! :) --
[Ebyabe]: Thanks. Oh, and the joke is to do with the new [[Battlestar Galactica]]. There are twelve new Cylon models that seem completely human. Eleven have been revealed, but the last one's still a secret. More [[Cylon_%28reimagining%29#The_.22Final_Five.22_.28Numbers_Seven.2C_Nine.2C_Ten.2C_Eleven.2C_Twelve.29_Humanoid_Cylons|here]]. This will probably start up again when the protection expires. This is the last season of Galactica, and the twelfth model is supposed to be revealed before the end. And I guess they're trying to say that Kutcher acts as well as a robot or something. Though I'm surprised they didn't add it to [[Keanu Reeves|this article]] instead. :) Anyhoo, danke. --
[Ebyabe]: [[Special:Contributions\/Duplicated|This user]] keeps making the same \""stealth\"" edit to the same link, undoing any changes. They've been warned, they've been blocked, but still they come back for more, they never respond to anyone. Whatever help you may provide would be appreciated. Ultimately, I wonder if the site could be blacklisted, 'cause I don't see anything else working *sigh*. Anyway, [[Good Night, and Good Luck.]] :) --
[Ebyabe]: Thank y'all. :) -
[Ebyabe]: It looks like the minute the protection tag expired, the same thing started again. It seems silly to have to keep re-protecting it, but I can't think of an alternative. :( --
[Ebyabe]: Thanks! Hopefully, Galactica will reveal who the ''real'' twelfth Cylon is soon, which should stop this. We hope... :) --
[Ebyabe]: A new user has been uploading fair use images [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&limit=250&target=Fivedollarftlong&month=&year=]. I added some to [[Wikipedia:Possibly unfree images\/2008 July 8]], but he's deleted the notices from the articles and images themselves. Maybe this could be moved up the chain, b\/c he shows no signs of stopping. Yeah, me, passing the buck, doncha know. :) --
[Ebyabe]: Danke. :) --
[Ebyabe]: Thanks for the revert. Like he thought I'd be fooled by it. Or fool you with another one of his vandalism report requests. I know we're supposed to [[WP:AGF|assume good faith]], but Ron's worn that out ages ago. The child is seriously demented. I mean, at least he's stopped with the mega-vandalism, but I wish he'd take the next step and ''really go away forever''. Oh, cheers. :) --
[Ebyabe]: And [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Special:Contributions\/BB_Bugs1_%28Wahkeenah%29 another one]. --
[Ebyabe]: As you can see, [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Special:Contributions\/Saremp this user] keeps adding the same fansite to the [[JC Chasez]] article. I actually left them a warning, but they continued unabated. Rather than keep reverting, could the fansite be added to the Wiki blacklist? It'd be easier that way. The user is obviously a [[Wikipedia:Single-purpose account|single purpose account]]. Cheers! --
[Ebyabe]: Hurrah! Thanks. :) --
[Ebyabe]: When you get a chance, could you look at the last few edits to this article? There's been back and forth on his ethnicity, and I don't think the sources added are reliable. Don't really want to get into an edit war over this, doncha know. Thanks! :) --
[Ebyabe]: Plus I'm wondering if there might be sockpuppetry involved. --
[Ebyabe]: [http:\/\/www.showfax.com This site] has been added as a reference to several TV show list articles by [[Special:Contributions\/Maquirri91|this user]]. Is that appropriate? I'm not sure myself, so I will defer to your greater wisdom. :) --
[Ebyabe]: I created it, and got the deletion notice, but didn't really care one way or the other. It was hardly being used anyway. I mostly made it b\/c there were other specific kinds of disambig templates (for boats, names, places, etc.). Have any of those been deleted? More curious than anything else. --
[Ebyabe]: Was it Ronnie again? Trying to pretend he was BB, leaving the project? Honestly, I can't fathom what he thinks he's accomplishing with these silly sockpuppets. Anyhoo, thanks. :) --
[Ebyabe]: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Special:Contributions\/Wspock50 Wspock50], [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Special:Contributions\/Allen_Beyda Allen Beyda] --
[Ebyabe]: Ya sure? 'Cause shortly after dropping you this note, he \""vandalized\"" my talk page. I suspected the second one more than the first. Though \""Wspock50\"" vs \""Wknight94\"" sorta fits his odd naming pattern. Oh well... :) --
[Ebyabe]: It does seem he's going kooky on the [[Whitey Ford]] page recently, though. The birthdate stuff, again. *sigh* --
[Ebyabe]: You mean it's not some sort of baseball reference? Anyway, good on the blocking, WK. :) --
[Ebyabe]: And the Whitey Ford page got protected. So what's Ron going to hit next? Place yer bets, ladiesandgentlemen, place yer bets! :) --
[Ebyabe]: When you get a chance, might you check what was added to my talk page under \""County Templates\""? The dude's trying to say Flagler Beach is in Volusia County, whassup wit dat? :) --
[Ebyabe]: Hm, according to [http:\/\/www.uflib.ufl.edu\/fefdl\/census\/volusiacensus.html this], it may be so. But on maps, it looks way too far from the Volusia County border for any of it to extend into it. --
[Ebyabe]: Maybe it's Ron? The misspelled edit summaries make me suspicious. --
[Ebyabe]: Dokee-okee. :) --
[Ebyabe]: This one should be blocked, imho. Only vanity articles and silly edits being made. Maybe for only a day or two, but I get the feeling he won't improve, sadly. Oh well... --
[Ebyabe]: Might there be any chance this could be semi-protected for a few days? Longer would be wonderful, but that's probably too much to hope for. Mostly it's b\/c of persistent additions of 2008-2009 movies that aren't documented. Frankly, it's pretty much a complete list, so I don't think it needs much in the way of updating anyway, imho. Anyhoo, happy holiday of your choice! :) --
[Ebyabe]: Thanks! Is that possible, the \""upcoming\"" list? I dunno if that'd help, but maybe. --
[Ebyabe]: It's happening again. Any chance of a repro? :) --
[Ebyabe]: Thank you, sah! :) --
[Ebyabe]: It's like he's going, \""Please, block me quickly\"". I can't figure it out. It's so hard to believe he thinks he's fooling anyone. Oh well, Happy New Year, let's hope. :) -
[Ebyabe]: How the NRHP determines the ''address restricted'' thing is weird. There are a number here in Florida that are perfectly easy to find. Who can figure out the gummint mind? :) --
[Ebyabe]: Could this be protected for a day, perhaps? Someone seems to have too much time on their hands. --
[Ebyabe]: Danke! :) --
[Ebyabe]: When you get a chance, could you respond to [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_National_Register_of_Historic_Places&diff=prev&oldid=263138521 this comment]? I see you deleted the articles b\/c they were created by a banned user, and I suspect that's who anonymously posted the comment. A brief history of what happened would be useful, doncha know. Thanks! :) --
[Ebyabe]: Thanks! Hm, maybe there's just one big sock farm, that all the puppeteers get theirs from. :) --
[Ebyabe]: Hi-de-hay. Guess what? I believe Ron has crawled out from whatever rock he was under, as witness [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Ty_Cobb&action=history here]. Just FYI. Happy nearly end-of-summer, btw. :) --
[Ebyabe]: I put a note on the article's talk page, to let the masses know of the wonder of Ron. I feel like I'm the Historian of Stupid sometimes, ya know. The Archivist of As... I'll stop there.  :) --
[Ebyabe]: I may be jumping the gun and being paranoid, but [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Rocky_Colavito&curid=660876&diff=320479674&oldid=319334136 this edit] seems very you-know-who-like to me. Just to letcha know. :) --
[Ebyabe]: And btw, if you've not seen on your watchlist, I finally got down to southwest Florida in April and took lotsa pictures. Gorgeous weather the whole 4 day trip. Cheers! --
[Ebyabe]: Yep, it's all the same, undocumented stuff about the families of these people. Very odd and monomaniacal. The trip was rather roundabout. Here's [http:\/\/uncacthulhu.blogspot.com\/2010\/04\/what-road-trip.html a link] to where I describe the route, so's you know what places to look for photos at. :) --
[Ebyabe]: OK, I am now officially jealous. :) --
[Ebyabe]: Please don't be discouraged in article creation. Stub articles aren't ideal, but how many featured articles started out as stubs in the first place? I stubbed the entire [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Florida]] about 4 years ago, with basic two to three sentence stubs. I did put in a couple of extra refs in each one, though. Part of the problem with the short-short stubs is that they used to have deletion attempts made on them frequently, due to insufficient assertion of notability. Not as much of an issue now, but it is something to think about, when creating any stub. My philosophy, though, is that articles have to start somewhere, and it's easier to expand something already existing. Some of us don't have the attention span to create extensive and gloriously referenced articles. But stubs can be expanded, that's what they're for. Some of the ones I created have.

[Ebyabe]: Someone that may put Ron to shame[http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Jason_Leopold&action=history]. Can something be done about this, por favor? A long block might be appropriate, to cool things down. I put in something at the [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard\/Edit_warring&diff=prev&oldid=376176365 admin noticeboard], but this is rather getting out of hand. Much grass. :) --
[Ebyabe]: Even if there's merit to his claims, he's going about it ''so'' the wrong way. I don't blame you for not wanting to get involved in the mess. It looks like the IP has been blocked for a bit, which is good. It amazes me at how obsessive people can be. Like [[Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations\/113.160.112.78|this]], for example.

[Ebyabe]: It's a book called ''A Guide to Florida's Historic Architecture''. Should be available at most libraries. See [http:\/\/www.google.com\/search?sourceid=navclient&aq=0h&oq=a+guide+to+f&ie=UTF-8&rlz=1T4GGLL_enUS378US378&q=a+guide+to+florida%27s+historic+architecture the Google results]. --
[Ebyabe]: Cheers! --
[Ebyabe]: Belated thanks. I'm categorizing and descripticizing the other 3,000-odd photos I've took in the last couple of months, which is why I didn't say so sooner. Cheers! :) --
[Ebyabe]: Thanks! The categories are populating. :) --
[Ebyabe]: Could you look at the recent changes on this? I've been trying to be helpful and diplomatic, but only seem to be partially getting thru. --
[Ebyabe]: Could you look at [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Temple_Terrace,_Florida&curid=109247&action=history these well-meaning but unsourced edits], when you gets a chance? Danke. :) --
[Ebyabe]: Thanks for adding the coords and updating the counts on the new listings. I was so happy I got photos for them that I forgot. Cheers! :) --
[Ebyabe]: I bet you also want to get photo-ing before summer hits and it gets ungodly hot, if California's anything like Florida in that regard. That's why I actually like roadtripping in the \""winter\"", or what passes for it here. If I'm lucky, I may actually get the state photographed sooner that I thought I would. Then I guess I'll have to start on Georgia and Alabama. Oh wait, already have a bit. Anyway, that won't be for a few moons yet. Enjoy the travellin'. :) --

Of all the people to accuse of being a Gator booster. I had to about fall out of my chair, since I hate all things Gator. I won't even wear orange and blue together. Some folks... :0 --
[Ebyabe]: Keep up the good work, but take a break every so often, doncha know. :) --
[Ebyabe]: Thanks for all the photographs you've taken and added to NRHPs around Tallahassee. I got up there recently and got most of the rest. Two evaded me, [[San Pedro y San Pablo de Patale]] and [[Tall Timbers Research Station and Land Conservancy|Tall Timbers Plantation]]. If you get a chance, could you get pictures of them? It would mean that the NRHP list for Leon County would be fully illustrated, which would be quite the accomplishment. Thanks much, and keep up the good work! :) --
[Ebyabe]: On a lighter note, I stumbled across [http:\/\/www.prairieschooltraveler.com\/home.html this site], which you might find of interest. --
[Ebyabe]: Oh, scroll to the bottom, that'll help. :) --
[Ebyabe]: Nope, I did mean the individual state links. I took some photos up in [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jax]] yesterday, and was checking to see if I got the right buildings. Found the site in the process. It's not a reliable source, per se, but could prove useful as a starting point to find out more about buildings. Later! :) --
[Ebyabe]: Advise, please, on where to report a problem. Various IPs over the last few days have been adding that he speaks fluent French. This apparently derives in part from an interview (posted on YouTube) for The Hangover II, which he does entirely in French. Others (including myself initially) have removed it as being trivial. So should I request a short-term page block, or try to get it to stay, or what? I'm confusled. No more than normal, I suppose :) --
[Ebyabe]: [http:\/\/www.blackbookmag.com\/article\/bradley-cooper-speaks-french\/26027 This is what I meant]. --
[Ebyabe]: Good enough. Thanks! Back to uploading photos to Commons. :) --
[Ebyabe]: D.C.? Yep, I bet you got lots of pictures. I have to get up there one of these days. And Commonist isn't working, so I'm having to do mine in batches of 10 at a time. The curse of being a photo nut, what a burden, eh? :) --
[Ebyabe]: Could you give me an example or two of appropriate articles? Then I'll know where to start. BTW, [[Torchwood: Miracle Day]], woo-hoo! --
[Ebyabe]: Ok, I partly figured it out. The category and template ratings are being lumped together under NA. I jiggered the code for the WikiProject Miami template. Won't know if this fixes things for a few hours, as it seems to take that long for changes to work through. If what I did doesn't correct it all by tomorrow, I'll have to investigate further. --
[Ebyabe]: By George, I think we've got it! Altered the template, and the changes are starting to happen. Created the template and category categories so they'll have somewhere to go. In a while, all that should be left in the NA category are redirects, which should be fine. :) --
[Ebyabe]: Travel broadens the mind and soothes the soul. I'm glad you're getting some of both. :) --
[Ebyabe]: Ahh, thank you, thankyouverymuch. :) Yes, I've pretty much done Florida. There are a few odds and ends, but mostly archaeological sites or really inaccessible places. So I'm pretty much done with the major jaunts, which is kind of weird. I'm doing some pre-planning for Georgia, but also taking virtual roadtrips via Google Street View. 'Cause it's cheaper, doncha know. :) --

Yip1982,False,"[Yip1982]: Also, if you have a look at the credits of the original Elton Hayes recording you'll see that it credits Victor Hely-Hutchinson as the composer. The other Elton Hayes recordings of Edward Lear also credit a composer of the musical settings that he recorded. Elton Hayes recorded the Dudley Glass settings of The Jumblies, The Quangle-Wangle's Hat, The Duck and the Kangaroo, The Table and the Chair and The Broom, the Shovel, the Poker and the Tongs.
[Yip1982]: I wanted to ask if it's possible to convert the American car terms on car model pages to British car terms. I saw that the Wikipedia pages on Rolls-Royce cars used the British term \""saloon\"" rather than the American term \""sedan\"". This made me wonder whether it's possible to try this out on the page on a well-known car such as the the Mercedes W126 S-Class. I can see you weren't happy at this and undid my edits. I know that Wikipeda may be American at heart, but I've asked myself if it could rely on British terms more often, even if British English vocabulary is hard to understand."

XLR8TION,False,"[XLR8TION]: Why are you removing the ethnicity of Puerto Rican and Dominican-Americans from their bios?  I find this a bit selective. Why arent you doing this to Italian-Americans,German-Americans, etc?--
[XLR8TION]: I have seen you reverted my reverts on this article. Many of these entries have sourced references stating Lebanese ancestry within in the article if you haven't checked. Therefore, those who have referenced sources will be readded to the list. If you have any questions, please ask, but will re-add those with valid references.--
[XLR8TION]: Then I will do so as aI dadd them to the list. --
[XLR8TION]: Same editor who was been vandalizing Domminican immigration to Puerto Rico is vandalizing [[Puerto Rican people]] article. Can you warn used and help file a vandalism complain with the site?--
[XLR8TION]: If he is anti same sex marriage (as he claims on his user page), why did [[User:NYyankees51]] removed entries from the article without a discussion? Seems like vandalism to me!--
[XLR8TION]: You can have a view on the topic, but WHY DID USER DELETE ENTRIES???  That's vandalism, plain and simple. Not even an iota of dialogue on the article discussion page. Just delete - blank - poof! Vandalism, plain and simple.--
[XLR8TION]: The difference between those and this vandal is that they are conversating on dialogue page and do not state that they are against SSM on their user page. It's like a Norweigan right wing radical removing information from the Prophet Mohammed's article with no discussion.  Doesn't take a genius that to see that is vandalism. It's vandalism, plain and simple and end of conversation. Have a good night. Will not continue further conversations regarding the vandal who vandalized the article. --"
LittleBenW,False,"[LittleBenW]: Since you seem to love the challenge of making useful tools, and probably created the above DAB page as a result of seeing the following: [[Wikipedia:Village_pump_(technical)#Redirect_capitalization_tool|This tool idea]] may interest you. I also discovered that it's possible to set up an '''article''' called \""Name\"" without being aware that there is already an existing '''category''' called \""Name\"" \u2014 the Wikipedia search box doesn't search Category and Sub-Category titles by default (I think it should), and most mere mortals will (a) never work out that it doesn't, and (b) never work out how to use the search box to find if there is a Category or Sub-Category called \""Name\"" ( problem [[Wikipedia:Village_pump_(technical)#Category_search_.2F_Related_search|described here]] ). Categories list many terms with related meanings. It would surely be useful if Wikipedia had a tool to prompt people who attempt to create an article called \""Name\"" that there is already a Category or Sub-Category called \""Name\"", and would they like to view that first (to help them find articles similar to \""Name\"" that already exist in the Category indexes)?"

[Ronz]: Besides, we know that Badagnani's problems have nothing to with me. I just was one of the people that thought it best to do something about him given all the problems he causes.

[Ronz]: To clear any confusion, I had an edit conflict with you at [[Attachment-based therapy (children) ]] that wasn't flagged. Makes for a confusing edit summary when you got your edit in there before mine without my knowledge. --
[Ronz]: {{unindent}}Filing a SPI report was probably the best step to take, given the extent of the past problems. --
[Ronz]: Thanks. One less distraction gone (for now). --
[Ronz]: You probably didn't notice, but that discussion is archived. I was thinking of moving it back to RSN, but I think a new discussion would be better. --
[Ronz]: I started a [[Wikipedia:Reliable_sources\/Noticeboard#blog.zagat.com_-_again|new discussion]] --
[Ronz]: You've brought up [[WP:BATTLE]], [[WP:AGF]], and [[WP:DR]] problems as well as [[WP:CIVIL]], so the scope might be outside WP:WQA. Many of the problems are repeated [[Wikipedia:Arbitration\/Requests\/Amendment#Request_to_amend_prior_case:_Race_and_intelligence|here]] (Note (06:40, 12 February 2011) and (23:50, 13 February 2011)) --
[Ronz]: While the article is much improved, I don't think any of the problems are close to being resolved. The majority of the article doesn't even have references. Let's leave the tags to invite others to help you to improve the article. --
[Ronz]: Thanks again for your work on the article, and your patience with me. --
[Ronz]: Yes, sources would be required before we could continue very far. It would be best to start a discussion on the [[Talk:Superfood|article's talk page]], and include some references there. --
[Ronz]: Thanks. I'll copy them to the talk page. --
[Ronz]: No problem. \""See also WP:COI in case it might apply\"" is something I add to make editors aware of WP:COI in these cases. --
[Ronz]: Can we mark the discussion you started at [[Talk:Musical_theatre#Response_to_my_offer]] as {{tl|resolved}}? Is further review or action needed? --
[Ronz]: The word \""superfood\"" is a almost meaningless marketing term, prohibited in the EU. As such, we've repeatedly had problems with the article becoming a means for marketing. --
[Ronz]: Wow! Thanks. It'll take me a while to digest all that, but should be interesting doing so. --
[Ronz]: Without a reference, any introduction of that material would be [[WP:OR|original research]] --
[Ronz]: Nice image! I've changed the caption to better coincide with the article. --
[Ronz]: Glad to see they didn't block you for long for that! --
[Ronz]: Since you've responded elsewhere on the article talk page, I'm going to be bold and mark it resolved. --
[Ronz]: You got caught in the crossfire when I was defending myself from abuse. I should have been more careful to make sure that it was clear that I didn't find you at fault. --
[Ronz]: I think a simple directory would be better, like the Open directory link already there. Someone's added it for you though. --
[Ronz]: Sorry you feel that way. If you want to discuss the situation, I can get uninvolved editors to help. --
[Ronz]: [[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Welcome to Wikipedia. Everyone is welcome to contribute constructively to the encyclopedia. However, please do not add promotional material to articles or other Wikipedia pages.

[Ronz]: I'm not sure what others will think of images of cv's. [[Curriculum vitae]], so they'd probably be redundant. --
[Ronz]: My concern isn't just about the one op-ed, but your focus on the single author. When you feel the need to add only sources by a single author to multiple articles, please discuss such contributions on the article talk page beforehand. Additionally, use neutral tone with so it doesn't appear you're promoting the author. --
[Ronz]: It's not just me that's deleted the external links you've added. I was just the first to bring it up on your talk page. I believe I've removed two, at [[China Mi\xe9ville]] and [[Tony Wright (Cannock Chase MP)]]. For any you think meet [[WP:EL]], I suggest starting discussions on the article talk pages. --
[Ronz]: You're adding external links and little else, and those links are promotional. I suggest taking a good look at [[WP:SPAM]] and [[WP:EL]], then take your arguments to [[WP:ELN]]. --
[Ronz]: Responding on [[User_talk:Bartolo_Cologne|your talk page]] --
[Ronz]: How's it NPOV in any way? Whatever it's based upon, it's entirely one-sided, right? --
[Ronz]: I guess it doesn't meet Wikipedia's [[WP:IMAGE|image guidelines]]. I've removed the image and asked for help from editors more familiar with such situations. The discussion is [[Wikipedia_talk:Images#Use_of_image_from_Flickr|here]]. --
[Ronz]: I've requested {{user|Mfmoviefan}} be blocked for spamming. From what I've seen so far, this looks like part of long-running spamming for Mark Sells. You mentioned sockpuppetry on his talk page. Can you provide details on the other socks? So far, I've just some ip's (all but one in the Denver, CO area) and Mark Sells' account: {{user|65.218.133.150}}(St Louis, MO), {{user|67.176.123.201}}, {{user|71.229.160.234}}, {{user|71.229.171.157}}, {{user|75.71.22.124}}, {{user|174.51.211.253}}, & {{user|Thereeldeal}}. --
[Ronz]: I've tagged [[Mark Sells]] as not indicating any notability. A simple prod would be fine if no one responds there. --
[Ronz]: --
[Ronz]: Good work. Thanks for letting me know. --
[Ronz]: Responded on your talk. --
[Ronz]: Again, the sources should be [[WP:RS|reliable]] and [[WP:IS|independent]]. Press releases and self-published sources are not appropriate. Warmed-over press releases aren't much better. [http:\/\/www.i-micronews.com\/news\/MEMS-quartz-components-contribute-Siwards-revenues-2011,6172.html This] looks like the best of what you listed, based on a quick skim. Do you think there's a better one? --
[Ronz]: A broader list of options is listed at [[WP:DR]]. --
[Ronz]: Much better. Thanks letting me know. --
[Ronz]: That would work too. My time is extremely limited, so I'll continue to work bit by bit on it. Providing detailed comments on the potential sources will make it easier for anyone interested in helping. --
[Ronz]: I'm doing what I always do when there's a poorly sourced BLP with pov-pushing editors causing problems - I'm trying to get us to rewrite the article from proper sources. Sorry if you don't like that I'm being slow and methodological about it. Harassing me about it won't do anything other than get me to notice that you're harassing me. --
[Ronz]: \""I'm being cautious, trying to make it very clear to Lambanog that we're not doing the same thing that he does.\"" --
[Ronz]: You misunderstand. I'm not lumping anyone else with him, etc. I just think the only real solution is to be cautious and follow policies\/guidelines closely and carefully. --
[Ronz]: Thanks for confirming that. It'll make it easier to focus on just getting the context and citation info. --
[Ronz]: I'm just going to continue working on the article. If others want to continue assuming bad faith to justify their actions, I'll just try to wait them out. --
[Ronz]: When I'm done assessing the references and potential references, I'll once again summarize my findings and start another round of discussions on what to do. Given the bad faith assumptions, accusations, and battle-ground mentality, I feel it would be detrimental to rush. In the meantime, I'll join any discussions on the current state of the article and how to improve it. It's a waste of time to try negotiating with editors who are working in or assuming bad faith, judging from the many times I've tried here. --
[Ronz]: The articles you've been working on are all in poor shape. I hope you'll continue working on them as you learn your way around Wikipedia. --
[Ronz]: Thanks for the heads up. In my experience with long-term meat\/sockpuppetry and pov-pushing, I think it's best to document the problems extensively to help prevent well-meaning editors from escalating the problems. --
[Ronz]: There are diminishing returns. I've moved on. --
[Ronz]: Thanks! --
[Ronz]: What a mess. I cleaned up the blatant problems. Thanks for pointing it out. --
[Ronz]: Glad you're working on it. Let me know if another sock appears. --
[Ronz]: We have multiple recent, ongoing disputes in the article plus multiple long-term disputes. I believe the current state of the talk page reflects this. Until these disputes appear even reasonably settled, I'd rather keep the tags than repeatedly having them removed and re-added. Keeping the article indefinitely partial-protected has helped - the current SPAs are much less disruptive in their continuing these disputes that have been ongoing since the article was created. --
[Ronz]: If you're not interested, then I don't know if you can be much help. --
[Ronz]: I restored the templates because they were removed before the disputes were resolved. --
[Ronz]: So, are you willing to look at the current disputes or not? --
[Ronz]: I assume you can provide a diff to help clarify what you're trying to say. --

[Ronz]: I'm taking a break from this. I suggest you do the same when you're overlooking recent edits and discussion in this manner. --
[Ronz]: Almost forgot the lede - Every bit of info there should be reconsidered per [[WP:LEDE]] and [[WP:NPOV]] - starting from scratch might even be better. Even more so than the rest of the article, the lede is just a placeholder that was cut back in an effort to get editors to focus on the body of the article first. --
[Ronz]: {{unindent}}Glad we're making progress. Care to consistently format and fully enter all the reference info? That was one cleanup concern that I recalled as I was reinstating the position info and timeline. --
[Ronz]: Thanks for letting me know. I don't have time to look into it in any detail atm, but will follow up. --
[Ronz]: Thanks! --
[Ronz]: Will do. --
[Ronz]: That's it? You make an article more like an attack page, against current discussions [[Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion\/Wikipedia:BLP zealot|here]] and [[Wikipedia_talk:Biographies_of_living_persons#Where_BLP_does_and_does_not_apply| here]], and you accuse me of stalking you? --

[Ronz]: If I were you, I'd choose one article that I felt was the best for a link to such applets, then start a discussion on that article's talk page presenting a case for including the link. You shouldn't add the link itself to the article. --
[Ronz]: Yes, the exam and fingerprinting information should be trimmed down. I'll take a closer look. --
[Ronz]: In general, it's best to be very careful when removing any sources. Make sure to make it clear why you're removing them. --"
{unknown-3954},False,"[{unknown-3954}]: Ha, you'll like this then, I created a page:  [[Wikipedia:Skeptic vs believer]]."
Geo Swan,False,"[Geo Swan]: I followed the career of this vessel, since before the first HH miniseries.  And this is not my recollection at all.  My recollection is that construction of the Grand Turk began when she was going to be used in a big budget film about the Crusades, that was to star Arnold Schwarznegger.  The film was cancelled.  The vessel was half-built.  The vessel remained half-built until the producers of the HH films acquired it, and completed it, trying to adapt it to look more like a frigate than like a 12 century vessel suitable for a film about the Crusades.  If you look at the Grand Turk in the first HH film she doesn't really look like a frigate.  The producers could have rented the reproduction of HMS Rose, which is based on a real frigate, as the producers of \""Master and Commander\"" did.  Presumably using it would have been too expensive.  Do you know where you got the info that she was authentically based on HMS Blandford?  --
[Geo Swan]: Yes, I did find it biased.  I still do.  Some of the people you stubbed not only haven't been convicted of any crime, they haven't been '''charged''' with any crimes.  --
[Geo Swan]: Can you really justify the inclusion of detainees the USA rounds up in their \""war on terror\"", when they haven't been charged with any crimes?  --
[Geo Swan]: My first suggestion?  No biographical article should be put in this category unless there is a formal charge.  No one should be included simply because of an allegation.  --
[Geo Swan]: Concerning your use of this tag -- you tagged Daniel Coburn, who was never charged with any crime -- but you didn't tag the [[Ilario Pantano]], the guy he testified against, who '''had''' been charged with murder.  Was this just an oversight?  --
[Geo Swan]: Concerning your use of this tag -- you tagged Daniel Coburn, who was never charged with any crime -- but you didn't tag the [[Ilario Pantano]], the guy he testified against, who '''had''' been charged with murder.  Was this just an oversight?  --
[Geo Swan]: You are correct.  The Pantano article is no longer a stub.  Thanks.  --
[Geo Swan]: You are correct.  The Pantano article is no longer a stub.  Thanks.  --
[Geo Swan]: If we are going to extrapolate when fictional Hornblower would have raised his flag as an Admiral by looking at when real Captains raised their flags we need to bear in that promotion came more quickly during war time.  The main reason was the needs of war required the promotion of lots of the more senior Captains in order to raise the most able to flag rank.  Dozens of Captains more senior to Nelson were promoted, and yellowed, in order to raise Nelson.  It is a minor point.  Most readers wouldn't care.  I tried to think of a real officer who was promoted to Captain around the same time as real Hornblower.  I thought of a few, but they didn't live long enough to become an Admiral.  --
[Geo Swan]: Anyhow, thanks for your prompt reply...  --
[Geo Swan]: Second - where is this other place where the incumbents are listed?  Why isn't this the place where the list should be maintained?  How are later readers, like myself, going to go check to see whether the list remains in existence a year later?  --
[Geo Swan]: (sigh) For the record I have no association with Ariele, other than fruitlessly urging her to confine herself to constructive contributions.  --
[Geo Swan]: I thought I was careful, and only included images that were entitled to be distributed as free.  Frankly, if was a lot of work.  I have been contacted by other fans of the original CCG images, from the DFO site, that were released by the DFO with too many conditions to remain on the wikipedia.  I have advised them that we have to obey the rules.  So, I am pretty pissed off that it looks like those who recently removed these image don't seem to have bothered to have followed the procedure.  --
[Geo Swan]: --
[Geo Swan]: --
[Geo Swan]: I went to a lot of effort to help those working on CCG articles to follow procedure and comply with image policy change.  And I expect those who choose to delete articles and images to follow procedure.  --
[Geo Swan]: I don't think it matters how overworked you feel.  You must follow the procedure.  We get angry at vandals and copyright violators, because they don't follow the procedures.  You must follow it too, no matter how inconvenient you and your colleagues find doing so.  --
[Geo Swan]: Thanks.  --
[Geo Swan]: Unfortunately, I also think trying to shoehorn Arabic names into the given-name, surname hierarchy we use is a mistake.  Some of the things that look like surnames to us are actually a tribal name, or village name.  But, it would be extremely difficult to reverse the current convention.  --

[Geo Swan]: We are all volunteers here.  No one should feel terrible for realizing they made a mistake.  [[WP:AGF|AGF]].  I am going to assume the reason you haven't offered an explanation for your deletions is not that you don't feel accountable -- that there is some other reason.
[Geo Swan]: I [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review\/Log\/2008_March_24&diff=prev&oldid=200658023 mentioned these eight deletions] in a DRV of a similar action.  I said I thought I had been civil to you.  And I told participants there that I was still waiting for your reply.
[Geo Swan]: I, for one, would appreciate it if participants in {{tl|afd}} held back from using opaque language.

[Geo Swan]: I urge you to consider that your unwillingness to reply gives the appearance that you are unwilling to be held accountable for actions you have taken.
[Geo Swan]: I remain mystified as to why you haven't responded to my queries.  I continue to believe that the responsible exercice of the authority entrusted to you obliges you to exercise that authority accountably -- and I think this means you have an obligation to answer civil queries.

[Geo Swan]: On the contrary, I believe those with time constraints should budget their time so they can fulfill their obligations on those project they do start.  The proper reaction to time constraints from our real life activities is to '''initiate fewer projects''' -- not to initiate the same number of projects, and then use time constraints as the justification for failing to follow through and letting the obligation to be accountable for our actions slide.
[Geo Swan]: Candidly,

There is no sign of a prior discussion of this merge at [[Talk:Maersk Alabama hijacking]].  Why doesn't your edit summary say where this discussion occurred?
[Geo Swan]: Someone pasted in a brief section on Phillips, that mentions his marraige.  It simply doesn't fit.  Frankly, the efforts put into merging the valid material from the Phillips article look like the work of a raw newbie, or worse.
[Geo Swan]: #What measures, if any, did you take to clean up after your bot?
[Geo Swan]: Didn't I notice he hasn't run his bot in over a year?  No.  I didn't.  And I don't see that should make a difference for good faith contributors who are trying to estimate the scale of the problems his bot left behind.  Maybe it was in the early runs of his bot, years ago, that it blithely tried to shoehorn non-European names into the European template.  But it is NOW that the errors the bot introduced are coming home to roost, because other bots have been written which assume that all \""listas\"" parameters were added by real human beings, who knew what they were doing.  And those bots are MULTIPLYING the errors Kingboy's bot first inserted.

[Geo Swan]: Do you still think this article should be deleted or redirected?
[Geo Swan]: Thanks for [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Geo_Swan&diff=320050672&oldid=319712301 your update].  Cheers!
[Geo Swan]: With regard to your suggestion that we contact the lawyers of getty, magnum, etc -- could you please confine yourself to serious suggestions?  Intellectual property is in the wild west phase right now.  Much is undefined.  When things are undefined no lawyer is going to give up one iota of the claims his clients might make -- even the most extreme and unreasonable.
[Geo Swan]: I don't think you have left me any choice, but to go to [[WP:DRV]] to request deletion review of this image.
[Geo Swan]: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ADeletion_review%2FLog%2F2009_November_4&action=historysubmit&diff=323888535&oldid=323886239 done]
[Geo Swan]: Individuals in France, the USA, and Canada, where I live, are granted intellectual property rights by their governments because the governments of those nations believe those intellectual property rights are in the general public interest.  Patents and copyrights are believed to give inventors and authors a chance to profit from their creations, so they can afford to continue making creations.  Intellectual creations are believed to be in the public interest, because modern western nations believe in \""progress\"".  Afghanistan is very backward.  And while there are modern elements in its population a large fraction of its population, including the Taliban, Hezbi-Islami Gulduddin, and many of the regional warlords do not believe in \""progress\"".  In the last four years Afghanistan could have signed on to international copyright agreements.  But the political will to do so is lacking.  I suggest this is due to a lack of support for the value of intellectual progress.
[Geo Swan]: You wrote: ''\""The tapes could have been published in Pakistan, for instance, in which case Pakistani copyright would be in force.\""''  As an administrator you are authorized to speedy delete articles or images under certain ''limited'' conditions.  If you have a concern over an article or image that is not a clear-cut, obvious case you have the same obligation as any other wikipedia contributor to go through the regular wikipedia channels.  Let's be clear here.  No Pakistanis played a role in the capture.  So the theory that the tape was previously broadcast in Pakistan is no more credible than a ''\""previously broadcast in Argentina\""'' theory, or Congo, or France.
[Geo Swan]: WRT to your assertion: ''\""the image in question is certainly a clear-cut, obvious case of underdocumented material\""''.  As I noted above, you have the advantage of me, because you can see the deleted content, and I can't.  But I suggest the appropriate response to missing documentation, or errors in the documentation, is to draw that to the attention of the uploader \/ contributors -- not summary, clandestine deletion.
[Geo Swan]: Please be advised that your argument, above, that Pakistani law would apply to images taken in Afghanistan, if they were first published in Afghanistan seems the opposite of what you wrote on February 12th about the copyright status of images of the corpses of the Goebbels children.  Back then you wrote that German law would apply to images taken in Germany even if the images were first published in the Soviet Union.  You are allowed to change your mind.  But, in the interest of clarity, may I suggest you say so, when you recognized you have changed your mind?
[Geo Swan]: Finally, you wrote: ''\""[multiple wiki-ids] used to abuse policy, ... would be an entirely different matter.\""''  For the record I do not believe, and didn't mean anyone to read into my comments, that I suspected the other contributor had set out to abuse policy.  What I remain concerned has happened is that a long term quality control volunteer, who is doing a task that other quality control volunteers consider important, has innocently slipped into a pattern of editing that lapses from what is best for the project over-all.  We are all supposed to be accountable for what we do here, and what we say.  With circumscribed exceptions at the highest level, our decision-making is supposed to be made in an open and transparent manner.  I remain concerned that the other contributor's use of multiple userids is not open and transparent, but rather is opaque and obfuscates their accountability.

[Geo Swan]: I thought you were concerned that the Guantanamo captives shouldn't be dehumanized?  Please explain how calling a captive an animal is consistent with your stand on dehumanization.
[Geo Swan]: There are still no incoming link to [[Animal Number 64]].  I anticipate other contributors are likely to either ask you to explain this redirect.  Less patient and understanding contributors than I am may just nominate it for speedy deletion.  This is less likely to happen if there are incoming links.
[Geo Swan]: Cheers!
[Geo Swan]: I mentioned their comment in [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Iqinn&diff=362470563&oldid=362277407#WRT_.22ad_hominum.22_.5Bsic.5D... a comment I left] on [[User talk:Iqinn]].
[Geo Swan]: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Talk:Sharaf_al-Din&oldid=364931378 fyi]
[Geo Swan]: Did you check the context where [[tool stone]] was used in other articles?  In the first three I checked both [[stone tool]] and [[tool stone]] were used in the same sentence.  Note that in [[ground stone]] article both [[stone tool]] and [[tool stone]] are separately linked in the very first sentence.  Sorry, but I think you will find that it is very annoying to readers to click on one link, and be taken to a different article.  Imagine someone reading one of these articles, like ground stone, or knapping, wanting to know more information, first clicking on stone tool, reading it, then clicking the back button, and then clicking on tool stone.  What is their reaction?  ''\""Why didn't I just read this in the other article?\""''
[Geo Swan]: I feel strongly that the merge was not a good idea.  And I plan to initiate the formal steps to have it reversed.
[Geo Swan]: I hope I have given you food for thought on using wikilinks to subsections heading in article space.
[Geo Swan]: Thanks [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Steven_David_(Judge)&diff=390723780&oldid=390705179 for the history merge]. Cheers!
[Geo Swan]: I completely agreed with your point that the nominator's assertion that there had never really been any al Qaeda safe houses in Lahore was not relevant.  In the discussion I asked for feedback over whether the redirect could be replaced with the stub at [[User:Geo Swan\/not ready yet\/Lahore safe house]].  I hope you don't mind me drawing your attention to the stub here?  I would appreciate your feedback. Thanks!
[Geo Swan]: I reverted [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Geo_Swan&oldid=407032928 this edit] as it complicated my normal routine archiving of all the discussions on my talk page.  Could you please refrain from this kind of edit in future?
[Geo Swan]: So could you please revert your closure?
[Geo Swan]: Their brief reply follows.  I believe it illustrates they didn't read the definition of \""ad hominem\"" I brought to their attention, and will continue to misuse the term in future.
[Geo Swan]: I want the opinion of uninvolved third parties.  I believe that my initiation of the {{tl|puf}} discussion was a reasonable thing to do.
[Geo Swan]: I'll take a look at Bensayah Belkacem this afternoon.  If there is material I re-introduced with the image, that shouldn't have been re-introduced, I'll trim it.  I request some patience here.
[Geo Swan]: I think I need to point out that someone using the Iqinn ID on commons uploaded five wikileaked images: [[:File:Khirullah Khairkhwa.jpg]], [[:File:Hamidullah.jpg]], [[:File:Tolfiq Nassar Ahmed al Bihani.jpg]], [[:File:Abdallah Aiza al Matrafi.jpg]], [[:File:Abu Zubaydah.jpg]].  Were you aware of this?  Was that you?
[Geo Swan]: I responded via email.
[Geo Swan]: improved in ways that addressed your concern(s)?
[Geo Swan]: What her article really needs is a couple of nice free photos.  One of the references I came across said that her beauty was balanced by her being an uncontrollable chain-smoker.
[Geo Swan]: IMO responsible participation requires revisiting the article and the discussion on the last or second last day, to check to see if comments left on the first day still apply.  IMO anything less than this level of responsible participation consumes the valuable time and energy of other contributors.
[Geo Swan]: Cheers!
[Geo Swan]: Here are some other DoD documents that mention Swift's role...

Hetar,False,"[Hetar]: {{PAGENAME}}, just wanted to let you know that I have proposed merging [[Mormon missionary]] with [[Mormon missionaries]].  I noticed you have contributed to these pages in the past, so please stop by one of the article's talk pages and leave your input on the merge.  Thanks!  --
[Hetar]: If you have uploaded other media, consider checking that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the \""[[Special:Contributions\/{{PAGENAME}}|my contributions]]\"" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting \""Image\"" from the dropdown box. Note that any unsourced and untagged images will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on [[wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#Images.2FMedia|criteria for speedy deletion]]. If you have any questions please ask them at the [[Wikipedia:Image legality questions|Image legality questions page]]. Thank you. --
[Hetar]: Simply linking back to your user page does not establish the source for the image. --
[Hetar]: I have changed the images license tag to match accordingly, and delisted it from [[WP:PUI]].  Thanks for providing the source. --
[Hetar]: Why even bother re-creating the article? If it is obviously an advertisement, and will just end up at AfD again, shouldn't [[WP:SNOW]] be considered? --
[Hetar]: Would you consider changing your signature per [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages#Images and Appearance|this guideline]]? Or at least make the image smaller? I know its not required, but it would mean a lot to a number of different users. --
[Hetar]: [[Wikipedia talk:Sign your posts on talk pages#Imposing signature restrictions]] and some of the following sections have details on many of the problems that users have with images in signatures. --
[Hetar]: #Posting on talk pages sounds like a great way to get more feedback. I would also suggest [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Books]] as another good place to ask for feedback and see more details about this type of article. --
[Hetar]: Since your an admin, could you please take a look at [[:Image:Wallis simpson.JPG]] which will be on the main page shortly (it's already protected). I just noticed that it has no source information, and an obsolete copyright tag. Thanks. --
[Hetar]: The web-screenshot tag is meant to apply to screenshots of webpages, not individual graphic or graphs from those pages. --
[Hetar]: Why was db-advert deleted? --"
Ocaasi,False,"[Ocaasi]: The talk page is quiet, and there's only one other person opposed to the name switch (out of 5 votes). Just trying to put down some consensus.
[Ocaasi]: Hi Thomas. I didn't get the Xena reference, but I assume it was a good one. I didn't mean to disparage your citations.  I thought they were excessive for the current state of the article, but extremely useful for future editors and readers. You're obviously doing some \""transition work\"". Maybe it'd be easier to keep your workflow going on a userpage draft, just because for as many great researchers like you there are Xena?-like editors like me. The discrepancy in approach was probably due to the fact that the article read much less well than all of the work behind would suggest, but I realize you were going to keep working on it. As for the introductory bullet-point list, it is not commonly used in introductions.  Often lists are a sign of information that would be better integrated in an article. But I didn't intend to disrupt your work, so, go ahead and add back whatever you prefer.
[Ocaasi]: Can you explain the Xena reference?
[Ocaasi]: Update. \""This message does not necessarily mean that your current editing has been deemed a problem.\""  This is kind of buried at the end of the 6th paragraph.  I didn't see it at first.  Because of the presumptuous nature of most templates on Wikipedia, I'd recommend rewriting the notice to be more clear up front that the warning is boilerplate and not connected to any recent activity.  Thanks,

[Ocaasi]: If there's nothing in particular you're responding to, it would help to have that clarified.  And if there is something you're responding to, it would ''really help'' to have that clarified.  If this is just a response to Anon's recent thread at Admin Noticeboard, then that would explain the notice, I suppose, though more details would be useful... as is it seems you prefer to have editors wary of crossing lines without indicating whether they have already been doing so.

[Ocaasi]: I obviously wouldn't expect you to just give it to me, but I know some new RCP\/AVT projects where it might be useful, assuming it can be properly handled.  If you have any thoughts, let me know.  Thanks!
[Ocaasi]: There's a neat discussion going on at [[WP:STiki|STiki]] creator [[User:West.andrew.g]]'s talk page.  His vandalism software can adapt new filters which coordinate with other algorithms to calculate a composite vandalism-likeliness score.  I'm trying to collect any data that might be useful to that approach, and an enormous database of prior reverts by editor\/ip could be useful, I thought. Maybe not.  Do you know about whether data from the AVT badwords list is stored, i.e. all of the edits that were reverted using AVT due to its badwords edit-filter being triggered?
[Ocaasi]: I don't think there's that much else in the vandalism world that isn't on the radar.  Some of it slips through the net, but I think more often that happens because it's not a great net, not because we don't know where to drag it.  End metaphor.  Do you have other hunches about the vandalism that isn't caught?
[Ocaasi]: I like your changes a lot.  I didn't know about it until today.  If PILT had automatic warnings and suppression of prior reverts it would be dangerously effective.    As for WP:BEANS, I think they're already stuck up there.  Which is a good thing, because there's a new community of researchers who are brainstorming about ''every possible'' kind of vandalism and how to detect it.  I don't think we'll encourage anyone in this case.  If you really want to see creative vandalism, go to the [[WP:LTA]] Long Term Abuse page, where the real monsters lurk.  Whatever you've seen with PILT is nothing compared to that havoc.  Or so I've heard.
[Ocaasi]: Hypothetically... A new user writes a biased section.  On talk, other users help to make it more neutral.  One editor offers his suggestion and puts it in the article.  I found the version to be unsatisfactory and reverted with a note in the edit comment and on talk.  Then I was reverted by an admin without a reason or a comment.  I left a note on the Admin's talk page.  Should I revert again?
[Ocaasi]: FWIW, the admin was mistaken about which study was being discussed and self-reverted.
[Ocaasi]: I'm still playing around with the details, but I think something like this could be helpful.  We did it at the [[Wikipedia:Pending_changes\/Closure#Working_Summary_.28unofficial.29|Pending Changes]] poll and it seemed to work there as well.  What do you think?
[Ocaasi]: I'm suggesting you let the block go, provided Laugh90 ''does not make these changes him\/herself''.  I'm going to keep discussing the sources with Legolas and take this particular issue to [[WP:NPOVN]] if necessary.  Laugh90, you should know that repeat violations of edit warring will lead to successively longer blocks.  Please return to the article not only ''to be right'' but to follow whatever process is necessary to civilly resolve the dispute.
[Ocaasi]: A few comments from an outside reader.  HkF (can that be a nickname? seriously confusing names are difficult to reference)...
[Ocaasi]: Hope this adds some context.
[Ocaasi]: Adding 10 talk page sections for 10 major revisions is still a lot to keep track of at once.  I think best practices here would be doing each section maybe one per week, so that changes can be tracked and addressed individually.  As is, it creates a bit of an all or nothing presentation for page-watchers, since they don't even know which edits to start with.  Also, don't get me wrong.  I enjoy being wordy as well... people just won't read your comments around here if you are.  It's a practical issue and nothing else.  ''I read your comments'' and find them interesting.  Most won't get to the interesting parts though.
[Ocaasi]: Hi, Anthony.  I found your page after comments about animal rights spilled over from SlimVirgin's talk page.  You seem interested in all aspects of pain--neurological, philosophical, historical, etc.,  and it's obviously very personal for you.  I'm wondering if you have ever heard of the Mindfulness Meditation research of [[John Kabat-Zinn]].  He is a meditation teacher and researcher who works a lot with people in chronic pain.  I think you might find some of his writings or talks insightful.  It's not, um, an answer, or even a theory, more just an idea about how people can ease pain by relating to themselves and experiences differently. If you want want to look him up.  We've got an article on him, and this google search should lead you in any relevant direction: http:\/\/www.google.com\/search?ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&sourceid=navclient&gfns=1&q=kabat+zinn+meditation+pain .  Not sure if you can access the full text, but here are two studies about it: [http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/hnpjournal\/Abstract\/2008\/07000\/Meditation_as_an_Intervention_for_Chronic_Pain__An.9.aspx] ; [http:\/\/www.jpsychores.com\/article\/S0022-3999%2809%2900094-4\/abstract].   Let me know if you're curious.
[Ocaasi]: this [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=2011_Egyptian_protests&diff=410865931&oldid=410865803].  check the lead, your work was reverted along with all other intermediate changes.  need to fix manually
[Ocaasi]: re:#4.  Right, I think with very breaking news, it makes sense to post it on Talk and wait for an online source.  That allows both confirmation and avoids having to do the referencing twice or leave out quotes.  I guess that could go either way, but I'm still partly attached to treating this article as one small step behind the news, for encyclopedic purposes.
[Ocaasi]: Yeah, I think Breaking News is a great place to put it.  That way we can encourage other additions to go there as well and turn the talk page into a little holding tank for new additions waiting for sourcing\/confirmation.  Also, I pretty much don't give a shit if you check your grammar with me, just at the article.
[Ocaasi]: Sorry, I didn't comment at the talk page.  The background section covers a variety of information important to understanding the historical context in which the protests arose.  Not every event was ''directly causal'' but they all help inform the reader.  That's why the section is called Background and not Causes.  Does that distinction help?
[Ocaasi]: let's not use vandalism\/sabateur in edit comments.  if there's an offense, an\/i is the place.  i think it's past though.
[Ocaasi]: oh, definitely shouldn't have been deleted.  but prosecutions in edit comments rarely help.  back to the page.  discussion is coming along.  difficult choice.
[Ocaasi]: Tangential to our discussion:  Hypothetically, if the family did not release the photo (I believe they did) but it nonetheless became a viral phenomenon of historical significance, referred to in multiple RS sources, and displayed on multiple blogs and minor news sites, would there be no fair use claim?
[Ocaasi]: Might I counter that there is an ongoing commercial interest with the PS3 hack such that possessing it allowed for further commercial disruption?  But in this case there would be no commercial basis.  It might still invoke NFC#4, but with a different reason.  I don't think Sony argued against the release of the key ''just'' for copyright reasons, but because they could demonstrate actual economic harm.  I'd have to read up on Sony, though, I'm just guessing.  I'm still stuck on the idea that once something becomes abundantly newsworthy or historically significant, fair use permits its republication for non-commercial purposes, especially if they are public interest purposes ''regardless'' of what the copyright owners think.  I'm not sure whether the law agrees, or whether Wikipedia standards agree, but both are interesting.
[Ocaasi]: I think he's saying that in his opinion Aljazeera is not as unbiased when it involves countries that are more closely aligned with the traditional Arab world (Egypt was kind of an outlier amongst the stalwarts, having a secular military dictator rather than Islamic).  There's nothing untoward about recommending the Washington Post and NYT.  They're as mainstream as it gets, and an insider's opinion that for some things they are more neutral than AJ or AA is not criminal.  We should use all of those sources, and describe the differences if they have major disagreements.  Any individual issues can be taken to [[WP:RSN]] or [[WP:NPOVN]].  Flatterworld, please don't think that every discussion like this is a conspiracy. Egyptian Liberal and Lihaas, it would be better to talk shop on the article pages so it doesn't seem suspicious.  Private political discussions are cool in userspace, but opinions about sources, etc. should be seen by editors at the topical article.
[Ocaasi]: I only saw my watchlist from today and didn't see the prior edit.  I'll check it, and I'm going to move both comments to the talk page so others can discuss this.  Egyptian's use of 'POV' would have also been premature as well and better handled at the talk page.  Please see my response to your response there, in a few minutes...

[Ocaasi]: I moved the discussion to the talk page.  I did remove POV-focused comments and non-content comments from all of our responses, but the arguments are still intact.
[Ocaasi]: Ronz, why not start a talkspace draft and use the sources on the talk page.  I'm pretty sure they support a good deal of the content, though perhaps with less detail.
[Ocaasi]: Yes, I know you were speaking about Lambanog.  What I don't get is why the focus should be on him anymore.  He seemed to want to include information regardless of whether or not it could be secondarily sourced.  That was not a great approach.  You resisted it.  Fine, fair enough.  But now we have lots of secondary sources, and it seems like you are continuing to play that same role.  You can call this kind of comment in appropriate, but I think it's obvious you are not a fan of Enig's theories, as many scientists and concerned citizens also feel.  But we're passed the point of establishing minimal notability and I don't see why the rest of the article should be a slow grind against your view of V and BLP.  It strikes me as using those policies against their spirit if not just a more subtle reading of them.  We can describe Enig's work in full without endorsing or promoting it.  We have plenty of primary and secondary sources.  Why shouldn't we do that?
[Ocaasi]: We have lots of proper sources ''already''.  So, getting us to rewrite the article from them is now something that you can participate in.  Slow and methodological is fine, but not under pretenses that the sources are inadequate or that there's a BLP issue.  I really think BLP is a red herring--and that might be a difference in policy interpretation--but it's not just ignoring the policy as it seems you're suggesting.
[Ocaasi]: I don't think I've appeared to be accommodating to any POV pushing here.  So maybe you could stop focusing on him so that it doesn't lump more productive efforts into the same boat.  You're attacking that approach, but between myself and Yobol there's plenty of careful editing, enough for any POV pushing to not be an issue.
[Ocaasi]: ''Two of my favorite editors.  Nough said I hope.''
[Ocaasi]: Just a heads up, the sourced excerpts are the total references from the article.  There's nothing else in them about Enig but what's on the talk page.
[Ocaasi]: A discussion about improving the help documentation inspired an idea--Wikipedia tutorials would be best if they were interactive and immersive.  The thought of a learning-teaching game came up, one based on a real interface with realistic 'missions'.  Would you be interested in providing some feedback or helping work on it?  The idea is just getting started and any assistance with the help\/policy side, the experienced-editor side, or the coding\/game-making side would be great.  Cheers,

[Milkunderwood]: :-) You're right of course! No idea what I was thinking, other than being up way too late.
[Milkunderwood]: Okay, I think I've got the explanation and footnote fixed pretty well now. I did go back and reinstate the two links that I think are necessary. Thanks for your suggestions.
[Milkunderwood]: I'm not unfamiliar with this type of sequence and have had occasion to use it before years ago, but now my wetware memory fails, and I can neither think what the charset is called, nor am I finding a list of the available characters. About the only special character I've had occasion to use for a very long time is alt-255 to insert an FF, forcing an apparent \""space\"" - I'm not even sure if this is part of the same \""&#  ;\"" charset. (I'm old enough that I'm much more accustomed to working with DOS than with Windows, but have forgotten nearly everything I ever knew about it. (In fact, I'm old enough to still being resentful of DOS having taken over the world from CP\/M, which had a much more intuitive set of commands.)) I wonder if you could point me to either a discussion or a full listing of these. Thanks very much for your help.
[Milkunderwood]: Many thanks.
[Milkunderwood]: Thanks for the re-do -- your edit is much better than mine.
[Milkunderwood]: What is the 0 (zero) you put at the end? A typo?
[Milkunderwood]: I see you were just now at [[Chants d'Espagne]] - did you happen to notice my new question re French vs Spanish titles in the Discussion?
[Milkunderwood]: I think I have a general idea what this is supposed to mean, but not nearly close enough to attempt a rewrite by myself. Are we talking about a piano trio sitting around \""naming\"" trios that they might want to play, or record, or just playing the sort of game that parents use to keep young kids amused on a long trip (or did before there were TVs and movies inside cars)?
[Milkunderwood]: With the overall title in Spanish, this makes it even more confusing.
[Milkunderwood]: I originally got to [[Chants d'Espagne]] from Alb\xe9niz rather than searching directly for the title, but now discover there wasn't a redirect from the Spanish. I've made two, for both ''cantos de espana'' and ''cantos de espa\xf1a''.
[Milkunderwood]: Also footnoted the four Spanish titles, but think these should preferably follow the French in the text itself. I hesitate to do this without knowing exactly how best to format.
[Milkunderwood]: Also I could change the footnote to read something like ''Historically the titles of the suite and of the first three pieces have usually been ''\""given\""''(?) in French rather than Spanish'' -- but I don't know what I'm talking about. Probably better to just delete the footnote. But then I'm still stuck with all these \""also known as\""s. Somehow it really needs a better and more thorough rewrite than I'm up for. --If I let it sit, maybe it might fix itself. :-)
[Milkunderwood]: Okay, all fixed now - check it out.
[Milkunderwood]: To me, the word \""strictly\"" still seems to stand out as a point of confusion - is this somehow a term of art? Is it as opposed to \""loosely\""? Maybe it's just me, but I'm finding it hard to put this word in its intended context. Otherwise, you have an excellent article here.
[Milkunderwood]: Much clearer - thank you.
[Milkunderwood]: 
[Milkunderwood]: Well you did the easy one, fixing the lede. I've linked ''parts'' to ''Part (music)'', but don't know how to specify the first definition only, since that article isn't sectioned. For explanation & discussion, I'm way over my head.
[Milkunderwood]: I very much appreciate any help you can give.
[Milkunderwood]: Very helpful - thank you.
[Milkunderwood]: (Note the [[List_of_compositions_by_Ludwig_van_Beethoven#Chamber_music_with_winds]] article already does say ''Opus 16: Quintet for piano and winds in E-flat major (1796) '''(later arranged for piano quartet)'''''.
[Milkunderwood]: Thanks for taking the trouble. I'd noticed the original article as I found it was a little sloppy, but hadn't tried messing with it - your tweaks read much better. Apparently you left my addition & ref alone as is, which had been my real question, concerning the propriety of pointing to Amazon for a specific recording.
[Milkunderwood]: Sometimes one sees ''Sonata '''a''' 3'', but sometimes with an accent grave, as ''Sonata '''\xe0''' 3'', etc, or either apparently indiscriminately, in the various permutations of this form - ''Canon a 2'', ''Fuga a 4'', and so forth. Is one or the other correct, or does it depend on the original language - for instance Italian vs. German?
[Milkunderwood]: That answers my question - Italian does not use the accent grave '''\xe0'''. Thanks very much!
[Milkunderwood]: That clarification helps, thx. And thus neither should WP per MoS - especially since very few contributors will have access to original scores.
[Milkunderwood]: I think my real question is whether WP should standardize, and on what basis? It seems that we can discount original scores since no one has access to them. Maybe it would be best to consistently use the unaccented '''a''' except where the title is clearly in French.
[Milkunderwood]: I'm in way over my head here, and yield the question. :-) [[User:Milkunderwood|Milkunderwood]] ([[User talk:Milkunderwood|talk]]) 01:11, 3 June 2011 (UTC) (I did understand your original ''Cave!'')"

[Sarah_Ewart]: The other editors have reached a consensus; you need to work with them instead of trying to impose and enforce your own POV. As it is your edits are only lasting for a short while before they get reverted. You're just wasting your time.
[Sarah_Ewart]: Garglebutt, could you please refrain from making personal attacks and comments like: \""<s>idiots<s>\"". I understand you're frustrated, but personal remarks and aspersions are making it very hard to collaborate and move beyond the edit warring and arguing.
[Sarah_Ewart]: I agree wholeheartedly re the POV issues, I just don't think the intensity of some of the dialogue is helping. I also agree with your MUSU edits and I've told them that I believe that quote should go into the article in some way, even if it's followed by a statement that the defendants strenuously reject the allegation. I do think, though, that if they can be steered away from the articles they're personally involved in, they could be beneficial to the site. But I have a feeling it will eventually take an RfA finding barring them from articles they're personally involved in. I don't think you should unwatch the articles.
[Sarah_Ewart]: No worries. I've actually had it on my watchlist for a few weeks now but each time I've noticed it being vandalised, someone has beaten me to reverting it. What other Christian-related pages are getting vandalised? Let me know and I'll add them to my watchlist.
[Sarah_Ewart]: Thanks for that. I had Jesus but I added Pope Benedict XVI. I appereciated the \""g'day\"" and \""fair dinkum\"" from a Hoosier (my uncle teaches at Purdue and I did year 12 over there).
[Sarah_Ewart]: Yes, translation, please!
[Sarah_Ewart]: Hello Cuddy Wifter. Regarding your recent Aus expat cat placements, I have reverted some of them because \""expatriate\"" is generally taken to mean \""residing in a foreign country\"". I believe it is accurate to say that when a person returns to live in their home country they are no longer considered an expatriate. I also do not believe people who have died are considered expatriates any longer. Cheers.
[Sarah_Ewart]: Wow! That was a very fast response! Thankyou.
[Sarah_Ewart]: Thanks for your reply. The definition above was straight from the dictionary, but this is Wikipedia's: \""An expatriate (in abbreviated form expat) is someone temporarily or permanently residing in a country and culture other than that of their upbringing and\/or legal residence.\"" I honestly do not see how people who have returned home or have died fit within that. Most notable Australians have lived overseas at one point. And so I think it is very confusing and misleading to label every Australian who has at one time in their life lived overseas as an expat. Further, I don't see the relevance of the British cats. Two mistakes dont make a right.
[Sarah_Ewart]: I merely came here to pay you the courtesy of informing you why I had reverted some of your edits. I have no interest in arguing with you. You can do whatever you want but I will remove people who are incorrectly categorised. Thankyou.
[Sarah_Ewart]: Hey Michael, thanks for your message. No, I do not think you have been out of line; not at all. I agree wholeheartedly about Siddhartha. Fortunately he has now been IP blocked for one month. But he emailed the mailing list claiming the block was \""unjustifiable\"" and \""without warning or vindication\"". I replied saying he was warned numerous times by numerous people. I'm just hoping another admin doesn't unblock him--it would be nice to have a month free of his game playing. Regarding an RfC, I think we should probably put that on hold pending the outcome of the block. Don't worry, I know that you are acting in good faith and I also agree that it appears he is not. I looked at his contributions the other day and he has very little in the way of edits to other articles. I think that says a lot about his agenda, motives etc.
[Sarah_Ewart]: Funny how we seem to be responsible for his behaviour. lol.
[Sarah_Ewart]: Rogerthat, a new editor [[User:Steveswain]] has been inserting Wagga Wagga as the birthplace of various footballers and sportspeople such as [[Leigh Matthews]], [[Dermott Brereton]], [[Tony Lockett]], [[Drew Morphett]], and [[Royce Hart]]. I asked him to cite sources but he seemed to stop posting after that. I have no idea if these edits are correct or not but some seemed bogus so I reverted all of them. Since you are the Aussie sports guy, I thought you might be able to take a look and revert me if they are indeed correct. Thanks mate.
[Sarah_Ewart]: Hey Crestville, re your query on the talk page, I did not want to make an outright accusation. I was trying to drop hints so they cut it out. The users in question are [[User:I'll bring the food]] and [[User:Ehmjay]]. Their behaviour that day was just bizarre.
[Sarah_Ewart]: I'm reasonably sure it's the case but I'm not 100% certain, that's why I didn't want to \""out\"" them on the page. The not signing their comments was just a minor thing that capped it off...their whole editing that day was really weird and their user pages are a bit strange as well. I'll bring the food hasn't been back since I posted that comment and I think Ehmjay knew I was talking about them. I think s\/he was just playing ignorant.
[Sarah_Ewart]: I know! I'm hoping he gets bored with it very soon. Thanks for blocking him so quickly. Last time he did this it took ages to get him blocked. Cheers,
[Sarah_Ewart]: No worries. I just reverted him on his userpage and gave him another NPA warning. If he makes anymore personal attacks, he should be listed on [[WP:PAIN]] since he's had at least two warnings for personal attacks now. Cheers,
[Sarah_Ewart]: I made a report at [[WP:PAIN]]. Feel free to add to it if you wish.
[Sarah_Ewart]: lol I know, he's so predictable with his edits and the articles he hits.
[Sarah_Ewart]: Bainer, could you please look at [[User:- 40]], [[User:- 41]] and [[User:- 42]]? They're [[User:Pnatt]] socks\/impersonators. I reported it at AIV, but no one seems to be around and as you can see, he's rampaging through Australian articles converting CBD > downtown. Cheers,
[Sarah_Ewart]: Thanks, I just added {{user|- 38}} and {{user|- 39}}. - 39 has been blocked but -38 hasn't yet. I hope he doesn't have another 37 of these to cycle through. :\/ Thanks, Bainer.
[Sarah_Ewart]: Mr Mets, I noticed that [[User:Merryhobby]] posted another long message here and I'm moving it back to his own talk page. I am going to ask him to post his questions and comments on his own page so other can respond to him as I feel his badgering of you has been really over the top. Please revert me if you disagree and would like his comment here. Hang in there, mate.
[Sarah_Ewart]: Excellent. I'm glad I didn't do the wrong thing! By the way, your friend [[User:Maxasus]] in the section above titled \""A reply\"" is a sock of indefinitely blocked [[User:Joshuarooney]].
[Sarah_Ewart]: Oh, I see. I've noticed a few other strange messages he's left various people. He also started  [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship\/Maxasus]] where he openly declares he's Joshuarooney, so I'm not sure what he's up to. :\/ <br \/>I've been really busy with work, but I have tomorrow off and I'm planning on having a go at the RfA questions then. So, if I can get the courage up, I'll do it soon. :)
[Sarah_Ewart]: Thank you! That's really nice to know. I'm glad you haven't changed your mind! :)
[Sarah_Ewart]: Mr Mets, do you think you could please update the edit count in your nom on the [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship\/Sarah Ewart|RfA]] page? I've just gone over 5000 [http:\/\/tools.wikimedia.de\/~essjay\/edit_count\/Count.php?username=Sarah+Ewart] Many thanks,
[Sarah_Ewart]: Hey Muchness, thank you for supporting my recent [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship\/Sarah Ewart|RfA]]. It finished with an amazing final tally of 160\/4\/1. I really appreciate your support. Cheers,
[Sarah_Ewart]: Hey Petrit, I've been deleting your files, but I was wondering if you wanted [[User talk:Petrit Augustini\/About Me]] deleted as well? I have already deleted the userpage but I wasn't sure if you wanted the associated talk page deleted. Cheers,
[Sarah_Ewart]: Okay, I think everything you tagged is deleted now.
[Sarah_Ewart]: Please use the talk pages to try to reach a consensus. If that is not successful, you may ask for an independent mediator and make use of other dispute resolution options. More information is available here: [[Wikipedia:Resolving disputes]]. Removing negative, unsourced material is the right thing to do and you have policy on your side in that regard, but please be careful of the other issues I mentioned earlier. Thanks,
[Sarah_Ewart]: Hey Junglecat, I noticed that you are listed in the cats as an American engineer and I was wondering if I could ask you for some advice? It is an admin related issue. I tried to email you, but you don't seem to have email activated. Do you think you could activate it here: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Special:Emailuser\/Junglecat]. The email will be sent via Wikipedia and I won't be able to see your email addy, IP or anything like that unless you decide to reply. Cheers mate,
[Sarah_Ewart]: Great to hear from you, Junglecat and thankyou very much for that! Cheers,
[Sarah_Ewart]: Thanks JC. I sent it just a minute ago, so you should get it soon. I really value your insight and will be very grateful for any thoughts and opinions you might have.
[Sarah_Ewart]: Brad, I think you should get your mainspace edit count up a tad so we can take you to RfA.
[Sarah_Ewart]: I edited the talk page, yes, trying to remove personal attacks and trolling. My involvement in that page was with regard to dealing with trolling and personal attacks, not content of the articles or any interest in Canadian politics. Oh, and you've been blocked as an obvious sock.
[Sarah_Ewart]: Knock it off. Removing a completely inappropriate source which was deleted from Wikinews for the same reasons does not reflect a personal interest in Canadian politics or my adding content to the article. I didn't even know who Michael Ignatieff was until I read the Wikinews article and followed the link back here. Removing a source which violated our guidelines does not make me an involved admin or discredit my statement.
[Sarah_Ewart]: And FYI, I acknowledged my removal of the Wikinews source nearly an hour ago. [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User_talk:Neutralizer#Blocked]
[Sarah_Ewart]: I looked at Bhutan and I've watchlisted it. I'm a bit concerned that some of the sections the IP is trying to remove read like editorialising and the article cites very few references for an awful lot of negative comments. I'm kind of surprised it's a feature article. I'll keep an eye on it and maybe if it keeps up it would be worth s-protecting it for a while to try to get the IP to discuss what the problem is. Unfortunately I know zip about Bhutan which makes it rather difficult. I might ask around for a third opinion, but i tend to think that the editorialising and negative statements needs to be chopped if there are no sources that can support it. Thanks for the daylight savings reminder, Merbabu, :)
[Sarah_Ewart]: I know and I [[User_talk:Ulvi_I.#Please_withdraw_from_this_dispute|asked]] Ulvi on his talk page to withdraw from the dispute between you and GM. I considered filing a request for checkuser when I discovered that his 13th edit was the dishonest certification of the [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment\/LIGerasimova|LIGerasimova RfC]]. Unfortunately, if he is a sockpuppet, the account isn't used regularly or frequently enough for them to still have the IP log to establish a pattern. And it's easy to get around checkuser once you're aware that it exists. I think he's probably a meatpuppet, rather than a sockpuppet, but either way, I do agree it is a very suspicious account. '''
[Sarah_Ewart]: I've moved it for you. Let me know if I've stuffed it up! :) '''
[Sarah_Ewart]: Congratulations David. I'm sure you'll be a fantastic admin. Cheers, '''
[Sarah_Ewart]: There was no assertion of importance. '''
[Sarah_Ewart]: I don't think so and it didn't say that anyway; it said that's what they ''claim'' they are doing, which is very different. There's no prejudice against another article if you think you can make a stronger case for notability. '''
[Sarah_Ewart]: Hey Jitse, on December 3, you selectively deleted the history of [[2006_Melbourne_teenage_DVD_controversy|2006 Melbourne teenage DVD controversy]] because an IP had added personal information about one of the boys allegedly involved in the incident. Unfortunately, today another IP added the same information back into the article and another admin selectively deleted the history but accidentally restored the edits you had deleted.I've emailed oversight-l and asked for the edits from December 3 and today to be oversighted. I just wanted to let you know this happened because I think it could easily happen again if people use selective deletion instead of asking for it to be oversighted. It's very easy to ask for oversight and the email address is here [[WP:RFO]]. Cheers, '''
[Sarah_Ewart]: Oh yes, I think they're all one person. I guess one little side benefit of them targeting the RfAs is we've managed to pop off a number of sleeper accounts we didn't know about. I noticed when blocking and tagging that a couple had been used before and had warnings on their pages. There was one account, {{User|Blotchun}}, which I found quite curious as the talk page was full of autoblock unblock requests and would seem to tie them into the \""briefs vandal\"". I just went through and indefinitely blocked all of them, but if you notice one I might have missed, just let me know. '''
[Sarah_Ewart]: Thanks for your message. I became aware of him when he emailed unblock-en-l@lists.wikimedia.org asking us to unblock him. It's all rather curious. Don't feel bad about what's happened...none of it is your fault or anything. And don't let it put you off welcoming new editors. Keep up the good work. :) '''
[Sarah_Ewart]: Acalamari, sorry for the delay replying. I don't really understand why you are wondering about negative consequences and whether other editors will hold your involvement in the
[Sarah_Ewart]: Okay, well, the talk page of that account has been deleted now so all your edits have been deleted as well. The only way someone could check what you said on that page would be if the page was undeleted (very unlikely) or an admin reviewed the deleted contents (also very unlikely). Even if it was undeleted, I don't recall seeing you do anything that would be an impediment to adminship, so I really wouldn't give it another thought if I were you. Hope that helps answer your questions. '''
[Sarah_Ewart]: I've removed it. The page has been deleted and can only be viewed by admins. Additionally, we now delete most pages about vandals and trolls per DENY and posting such pages to BJAOAN just undermines that. '''
[Sarah_Ewart]: Sorry I wasn't online yesterday. I'm trying to have a semi-break and haven't been online as much. It looks like the problem is resolved? After looking at the account, I'm quite concerned about the username and bio. This person doesn't write like they have a MFA in writing. I think the account might need to be verified in case it's a student pretending to be their lecturer or something. You've interacted with her a bit, do you have any thoughts on that? '''
[Sarah_Ewart]: Thanks Merbabu. I'm going to put a username block on the account and she can email me from her work address if she wants to verify she is who she claims to be. I also googled the name and I came up with an English professor of that same name who was teaching at Wichita State Uni in 2000 [http:\/\/www.wichita.edu\/insidewsu\/@11-2-2000\/Of_Note.htm] but I have no idea if this is the same person or not. I share your concern about making things difficult for the real person...I feel it is more likely this actually a disgruntled student or something. Cheers, '''
[Sarah_Ewart]: I've blocked her. I think \""high or out-of-it\"" is a very apt description. It's hard to imagine a college professor writing like that under her real name on a public website. :\/ '''
[Sarah_Ewart]: No probs. Have a safe trip and a nice break. :) '''
[Sarah_Ewart]: Good point. I was going to delete them if I didn't hear from her but I might go ahead and blank them in the interim. At least that way the information won't show up on a google search of her name and it;s easy enough to revert in the unlikely event she is fair dinkum. '''
[Sarah_Ewart]: I remember you from your previous RfAs and your invitation to join adopt-a-user, however, you're mistaken about that userpage. I've never edited it before and in fact, neither have you. The only people to edit it were David Gerard, Rdsmith4, Adam Rock and Cydebot. '''
[Sarah_Ewart]: I'm going to send you an email shortly, Merbabu. I want to call you some choice four letter words which I can't do on-Wiki. '''
[Sarah_Ewart]: You don't have email enabled! AHHHHH!!! Beep you!!! '''
[Sarah_Ewart]: Thanks. I'm not surprised. I think most of us thought that was the case, but I'm pleased that he at least had the integrity to own up in the end. Most people just vanish and don't bother responding once you ask them to verify. '''
[Sarah_Ewart]: I deleted it. It was really an [[WP:CSD|A7]] biography. Cheers, '''
[Sarah_Ewart]: No worries. If you look down the right hand side of the page I linked to before, in the box called \""deletions tools\"", you'll see a heading \""Speedy\"", that section has all the speedy tags you can choose from. '''
[Sarah_Ewart]: I'm not really sure what you want us to do about it but I don't think anything can be done. I suggest you just ignore it. '''
[Sarah_Ewart]: Thankyou Michael, I appreciate your message and I agree that neither off us should leave over it. I want you to know that this honestly is not about you. You ask what I think, I think you're an excellent editor, but I wish you would tone down your responses to other people. The regular editors might be used to it but I fear that new people might look at some of those pages and be scared off contributing at all. My block of you was only for 24 hours, it wasn't a long block and I would have unblocked you straight away if you had indicated that you understood that abusing people was not on and that you would try to be more careful in future. It concerns me that you think you don't have to follow NPA and CIVIL just because you don't intend being an admin and It concerns me more that other people seem to be condoning that idea. But thankyou for your kind apology, I do appreciate it. '''
[Sarah_Ewart]: Guys, please, I appreciate your messages but dramatic departures followed by \""please don't go\"" pages make me cringe and it's not what I want. This isn't about Michael. It's about a whole lot of things and the emails I got about Michael were just the final straw. I consider myself to be joining John in Hotel Wiki Recovery. I don't consider myself to be leaving, so there really is no need for this. '''
[Sarah_Ewart]: However...neither Michael or Blnguyen are in any way responsible for my break and I don't want either of them feeling they may be. I've been feeling wiki-exhausted since dealing with Merbabu's professor and this was just a case of the final straw. Also, I have some real life family stuff that I need to deal with and I'd probably be having to cut back my Wiki time now anyway. So I don't blame anyone here and I'm not angry or upset with anyone who was involved or who has commented since. You boys are all very special and I don't want you arguing about it. There isn't anything to argue about as far as I'm concerned. It's all resolved and dealt with and in the past. '''
[Sarah_Ewart]: But I hoped we can all leave this in the past now and move on. I would hate for this to cause any rifts between any of us. '''"

[Eric444]: I only have the country music Billboard books, so James Taylor's entry is only four lines long. There are a lot of websites dedicated to country music discographies, so there must be one for pop discographies hiding somewhere on the internet.

Elucidate,False,"[Elucidate]: Hi there JoJan. I see you have recently reverted one of my edits, namely to the article [[Rose]], as vandalism. I appreciate the speed of your edit: great job. However, the edit was ''not'' unconstructive. If you look carefully at my edit, you will see that in it I had identified the variety of rose illustrated by one of the images in the botany section. Unfortunately, my browser occasionally malfunctions while I am editing this wiki, and as a result, randomly inserts javascript into the page. It appears to be taking code from my monobook.js, and pasting it onto pages I edit. I have thankfully fixed the problem, which I believe was associated with the automated peer reviewer I use. I have removed the code from my monobook, as it does not appear to be compatible with [[Google Chrome]]. Thank you for your concern: I have now re-edited article [[Rose]], without any problems. If you have anymore concerns, please notify me. Also recall our policies on newcomers, namely [[WP:BITE]] and [[WP:AGF]]. As you are an admin, I am sure you are familiar with them. Good day,
[Elucidate]: <br \/>I think its time to be [[WP:BOLD|bold]]. I would be more than willing to help get the project off the ground. What do you think?
[Elucidate]: I've already seen both of those pages, and done an in-depth viewing of them. See [[User:Jjron\/VP Trial|here]] and [[User:Jjron\/VP Trial 2|here]]. I have also looked at the other records. I really like the idea of initiating this here on Wikipedia, but I doubt that the time is quite right. In time, I believe that a Valued Image department would benefit Wikipedia, but not today. When the time is right, I will be more than willing to initiate this project.And to answer your question, I am not an 'old-timer' from Commons. I created both my Commons and Wikipedia account just two weeks ago. However, I've been around. I'm pretty familiar with policy and the way things work. I think my next goal will be to get the [[Dog]] article to GA status: that could prove fun.
[Elucidate]: I've started. I have requested the creation of a Valued image seal, which I hope will be designed by the Commons illustrator LadyofHats. I have created the Valued image main page. While the Valued image and Picture Peer Review departments will be interlinked, I am creating a seperate page for VI. I will post the links to the relevant pages on your talk page as soon as everything is ready.
[Elucidate]: All done. It's still a bit rough, but once I've got a seal designed and fixed the last few things, it'll be up and running. See [[Wikipedia:Valued pictures]]. Thanks for your help with the basic design and for starting the idea up. So, I'll see you around at the nominations page then?
[Elucidate]: 
[Elucidate]: Thanks for fixing [[Wikipedia:Valued picture candidates\/Closing procedure]]. That error had slipped my notice. What do you think of the setup?
[Elucidate]: The VP seal is no longer in use. I have requested a new design. It was used in the old version of the page I subst'd onto your page and a number of other user talk pages. It is no longer used on any of the VP pages. I think I might extend the time period for the project, though. The tenth of November is rather soon, and I'm not sure we will have got enough input from other users. I think I'll move the opening date to the first of December.

Anyway, it's there, but it really does look like pretty classic fringe-pushing, complete with Nobel laureate name-dropping by a unjustifiably persecuted engineer working to revolutionize biochemistry by ignoring the scientific consensus and promoting ideas through case studies about people with ill-defined, poorly treated conditions that defy conventional treatment (hello chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, chronic lyme disease, I see you're all here...)

[Pablo X]: To answer your question, seeing as you have finally actually asked it unambiguously and directly, I have had an e-mail from a poster on the 'Injustice in Perugia' forum who followed a link from there to the list of single-purpose accounts. Like you, this person is convinced that Knox is innocent (poor old Sollecito seldom seems to get a mention), but unlike you perhaps, xe feels that the 'cause' is possibly being harmed by various postings all around the internet - blogs, forums, comments on news articles, youtube, Facebook etc. I say you 'may be familiar'  with Injustice in Perugia because I am assuming that the Wikipedia user \""Bruce Fisher\"" is the same \""Bruce Fisher\"" who started that site.&nbsp;
[Pablo X]: Blimey. You try and be friendly, and you get called nasty names.&nbsp;
[Pablo X]: Actually, perhaps she has a point about waving at the other two sites, I've never seen TJMK but have looked at Perugia Murder File (which was a bit mad, and seems to have divided amoeba-like into two sites with the same name!).

I'll keep searching for sources. --

[Pelotas]: I'll try! --
[Pelotas]: I was originally just thinking of translating (from the [http:\/\/nl.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Omkoop-_en_gokschandaal_in_het_Belgisch_voetbal Dutch wikipedia]) the final paragraph I haven't done yet and that was it. I have not thought of the 'deepness' of the article or the fact if the topic deserves a full article, but maybe you're right. However, I don't really know a lot about other facets of gambling and bribing in belgian soccer. --
[Pelotas]: No Problem, I'm not sure if it is entirely right though, the translation I made from Dutch back to English is correct, but I'm not sure about the original English to Dutch. \""Cool\"" does not in any way resemble \""Tight\"". --

[Pelotas]: Yes sure I'm still very interested. --
[Pelotas]: Looks very nice, however I have a rather small screen and the right menu is moved below the left part. Maybe you could make the left menu smaller? (e.g. Just as big as the where I've been\/What I am thinghy?) But I like the way it looks! Very nice thanks. --
[Pelotas]: Done. Although I'll be honest, I just added the three most used sites by myself when I want to look up any information about the league, instead of veryfying the wikipedia content with those three sites. I do not use them to update the goal scorer list, because if you investigate those closely, then different sites will always give different results. So how do I know it is right? Well, I have a huge excel sheet in which I add each and every goal scorer in each match played. Once you have the list it's no so much work to update it every week, I even have more trouble with keeping the length of the columns the same ;) --
[Pelotas]: I can see where this unified color scheme would be useful indeed, maybe we should make a standard template which explains the colors, as they did for formula 1 [[Template:F1 driver results legend 2|here]] (It is added as a key for instance [[BMW Sauber#Complete Formula One results|here]]). Also, in the standings by round we should create unified templates there also, as for instance the color scheme for the Spainish league ([[La_Liga_2008-09#Positions_by_round|here]]) is completely different from the standard one [[Belgian_First_Division_2008\u201309#Positions_by_matchday|here]] and the colours should probably be linked to the ones chosen before... --
[Pelotas]: Got it, don't have the time right now though. Also never heard of her before :) But maybe I will do it towards the end of this week if I find some time.
[Pelotas]: Have not looked at it again, but I'm quite sure it was wrong or at least incomplete. It is mentioned clearly that the results of the last team are not counted in this ranking. I'm guessing you did add them, or forgot to add the results against a another team. If however I did make a mistake, then sorry.
[Pelotas]: Hi Edson, I'm not quite sure what you are asking, but in theory you could just ask what you want on each page. If it's correct meaningful information, somewhat structured and in theory following the wikipedia guidelines, then you cannot do anything wrong. If you do, someone will correct it anyway. In this case, you could for instance add the info on pages [[2010 FIFA World Cup Group A]] through [[2010 FIFA World Cup Group H]], as a section at the top, or for each match individually within the article. Anyone can edit wikipedia, that's the basic idea! :) So you do not need do put your address or email anywhere. If you create a (free) account however, then you avoid problems with blocked pages (Sometimes this happens because many unregistered users try to ruin pages). Now whether you create an account or not, when posting on talk pages, you should sign your comment by putting <nowiki>~~~~<\/nowiki>, this automatically changes into your ip address (or nickname) and adds the time of posting. If you have more questions, feel free to ask!
[Pelotas]: Yes I like the idea, but it's too much detail to put it on the main article page. So maybe you should add the information at the individual match paragraphs, so at [[2010 FIFA World Cup Group G#Portugal v Korea DPR]] for instance for the 5-3 result of 1966.
[Pelotas]: Well, for instance use [[1966 FIFA World Cup#Group 1]] at [[2010 FIFA World Cup Group A]]. :)
[Pelotas]: Probably too much side information without sticking to the core of the article. You can ask on the discussion page and maybe it can be put back on. I'm thinking that it will only get 'more' though as there are more and more world cups. So maybe it's not the most ideal place. Maybe you could create a new article, somthing like: \""frequent fifa world cup matchups\"" or so...
[Pelotas]: Yes sure that makes sense you have a good point. I'll do it this evening.
[Pelotas]: That makes perfect sense indeed. :) I'll have a look maybe I can do it this afternoon,

[Chase me ladies, I'm the Cavalry]: Revdeld as requested. However, do you really think it's appropriate of you to be editing articles about circumcision considering the website you run and the strong views you hold? Try editing some other topics in future please, lay off anything you have a COI with :-)
[Chase me ladies, I'm the Cavalry]: Just so you're aware, I've spent the previous two hours looking into your edits because of a concern that the Twitter account might actually belong to you - thank goodness it doesn't. You might want to report it to Twitter as an abusive impersonation account. I checked over the related discussions, including the one you link me to, but it seems that there was never a conclusion reached. You may only be interested in advocating circumcision, but what I'm asking is that you 'diversify your portfolio', lest people see you as a single-purpose account and act accordingly!
[Chase me ladies, I'm the Cavalry]: Hope we'll see you there, (and apologies for the talk page spam) -
[Chase me ladies, I'm the Cavalry]: [Incivility redacted - WMC], whilst I appreciate you're upset and that this is a big step to take, but I've looked into this for the past few hours and I'm convinced that this is the best solution. I have pointed to you calling other users incompetent, calling other users twats, and I could now point to you calling other users idiots. Your doing this is not conducive to a pleasant atmosphere for editing; it drives other users away, which in turn disrupts the project. I don't often put my foot down, and I hardly ever comment on user conduct in a public forum such as this: but this is one of the few cases where I don't honestly believe you're willing to work with other people in a friendly atmosphere. You might be a good article writer, you're no doubt a perfectly amiable chap in real life: but Wikipedia is more than being a good article writer. Wikipedia is a community, and if you can't bring yourself to the same level of pleasant, polite discourse as other users - however wrong, stupid, twattish or incompetent they might be - then you need to consider whether Wikipedia is a community you're happy to be a part of.
[Chase me ladies, I'm the Cavalry]: Boris, I think what you're bringing up is a different issue - or at least it's an issue not directly related to this unblock request - but at first glance I would have blocked in each of those cases as well. I know feelings run high on such contentious issues, but there's never an excuse for incivility from either side. If, in future, you find yourself being harassed by people not willing to work within the community's pillars, by all means contact me and I'll warn and block as appropriate.
[Chase me ladies, I'm the Cavalry]: Of course not, but I'd like to keep this on-topic, regarding WMC's block and WMC's block alone. Bring up an ANI or Wikiquette report about other user's conduct, point me in the right direction, and I'll give you my views there..
[Chase me ladies, I'm the Cavalry]: I appreciate what you're saying, but it'd hardly be appropriate - it'd look like Boris calling my bluff had forced me into warning or blocking LHVU, and the entire point of me warning him would be lost in the ensuing drama. The key point here is that everyone involved wants equal, fair treatment: so let's make it as equal and fair as possible. Let's bring this up at ANI, exactly where WMC's civility issue was brought up. There's naught more equal than equal treatment.
[Chase me ladies, I'm the Cavalry]: I should note that this isn't a permanent block: it's an indefinite \u200eone; that is, one which lasts \""until such time as you indicate you are willing to enter into a dialogue about the issue\"", and presumably that the community is satisfied that their concerns are resolved. I have a few questions which you're not obliged to answer: were you aware of the discussion on ANI? If you were aware, why didn't you participate?
[Chase me ladies, I'm the Cavalry]: It was, indeed, a reply to CubeLurker. Nevertheless, given the circumstances, Pedro's message was kindof understandable - we're all a little jumpy here, given the leak. A load of my personal details were leaked, as well as my fianc\xe9es. I just don't want everyone to start leaping at each others throats over this.
[Chase me ladies, I'm the Cavalry]: And all the best to yourself - rest assured we're (ArbCom and WMF) working overtime to solve this. It would be an understatement to say that I do not particularly like the leaker at present, and can think of a few four-letter words I'd like to throw in his direction.
[Chase me ladies, I'm the Cavalry]: Done.
[Chase me ladies, I'm the Cavalry]: Of course. I'm a little busy at the moment, so I hope you won't mind if I get a full reply to you tomorrow.
[Chase me ladies, I'm the Cavalry]: I used the [[WP:ROLLBACK|rollback]] tool, and clicked rather a lot. I'm happy to switch it on for your account, if you'd like?
[Chase me ladies, I'm the Cavalry]: You definitely don't have it. Maybe that's part of [[WP:TWINKLE|Twinkle]], if you have Twinkle switched on? I've switched Rollback on for your account now, so you should see it appearing in 'history' pages. You should, as a rule, only use it for reverting obvious vandalism - see [[Help:Reverting#Rollback]] and [[WP:ROLLBACK]] for more on how (and when) to use it. Any questions, let me know!

[Chase me ladies, I'm the Cavalry]: The comment you left isn't one I have any intention of replying to. Myself and Dan Bull's connection, is public knowledge. Jimmy and the Foundation are aware of it too; Dan offered to help in the 2010 fundraising campaign, which I was a part of. I see that you're trying to dig up dirt on me - as you are wont to do - but believe me, all the dirt was already dug up by the good fellows at Wikipedia Review. I suggest you try there and read up on me and my history. They've got my real name, links to TV interviews, all of it. If you're lucky, you might even get a link to the Edwin Black stuff.

[Chase me ladies, I'm the Cavalry]: Thanks. If I get time, I'll join in the discussion there.
[Chase me ladies, I'm the Cavalry]: Yes, those are suitable changes - any change which is broadly neutral, but more accurate, can only be a good thing. As to a suitable forum, I would say an RFC - however, seeing as there's now an arbcom case open, that complicates matters somewhat.
[Chase me ladies, I'm the Cavalry]: Sorry, but I'm not comfortable with commenting here unless the rest of the Committee asks me to. I'm officially recused on this case.
[Chase me ladies, I'm the Cavalry]: I'm just not comfortable with it. I tried a novel solution to a problem, and a vocal minority disagree with my solution. There's also the very real possibility that I will be named in the case. If, therefore, this discussion is going to take place, I'd rather it took place either as ''part'' of the case, or after the case has concluded. Sorry, but I take a very strict line over things like this, and given that there's a 63-party, potentially problematic ArbCom case in the offing - with me near the centre - I'm going to tread the cautious line.
[Chase me ladies, I'm the Cavalry]: No worries. I want to make it clear that I'm not dismissing this discussion - I'm just not keen on having it now.

Rossenglish,False,"[Rossenglish]: I have been searching for references to the UN building using Portland Stone. I always assumed it to be correct, but never checked it out before. I couldn't find any direct mentions of the use of Portland Stone (that were not just brief mentions on sites about Portland), but on the UN site, [http:\/\/www.un.org\/geninfo\/faq\/factsheets\/FS23.HTM], I found that the east\/west smaller sides of the building use 'an English limestone'. This could be Portland Stone, so I'm trying to find references of the construction of the east\/west sides of the building. If I can't find anything soon I'll just remove the mention of it - I already took it out of the lead.
[Rossenglish]: I really cannot find a reliable source of info on the construction of the UN building which includes Portland Stone. None of the local history books in the library have reference to it either. For the time being, I have removed the sentence about it from the article, but it can be replaced if anyone finds a good enough reference."

[Folantin]: Hi. I've been told you 're the moderator for featured lists candidates. If so, would you mind clarifying how the FL candidacy process actually works. What I mean is, who decides whether a list will pass? Is it based on the opinions of a majority of reviewers or can the objections of a single reviewer hold it up? If the latter is the case, then what if that reviewer's objections don't appear to follow the criteria for featured lists? In other words, if the objections are invalid and overly subjective, do they still prevent an article from passing? I'm asking with reference to this [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia:Featured_list_candidates\/List_of_major_opera_composers]. One user (Renata) insists that the list must use certain templates, which are technically difficult to employ  and do not appear to be necessary according to the featured list criteria. She also wants an extremely long introduction, whereas the criteria say that the intro should be \""concise\"". If you could clear up this situation, we'd be very grateful. Thanks. (Obviously, if you ''aren't'' the relevant FL moderator, then completely ignore this message and my apologies for wasting your time).--
[Folantin]: No problem. Ideally let's try to avoid the composer infoboxes discussion ''per se'' again because I bet everybody is thoroughly sick of that debate by now. Maybe from where I say \""I think the basic problem with WP:BIO is its absurdly overambitious scope...\"" onwards would be best? Thanks. --
[Folantin]: It's also probably advisable to tone some of it down a bit in its new context otherwise it looks as if we're going into their domain mobhanded. The stats I used are not precise and some may take offence at being referred to as \""some editor\"" rather than by name. I'm not looking to start a war with WP:BIO, but a civilised discussion would be OK. Contextualise it in some way if you can: \""This is what it looks like to an outsider\"", for instance. I've had enough conflict over the past few days! --
[Folantin]: Nicely handled. Thanks. --

[Folantin]: Maybe you should add some comments there as he invites you to do. IIRC Ottava evaded a community ban last year by agreeing to be put under mentorship. Once the mentorship period expired, he was back to his old ways. He now thinks he has ''carte blanche'' to insult any user who contradicts him in any way. This guy will never admit he is wrong on any topic ever. His friends on Wikipedia will try to prevent any ban. --
[Folantin]: (I must apologise for inadvertently bringing him to the page. He has a long-standing grudge against me.

[Folantin]: Happy New Year too! 2010 was quiet for me round these parts and I liked it that way. My only run-in was with a standard-issue ethnic POV-pusher who tried to file an SPI against me. Unsurprisingly, just a few days ago he was outed as a big-time  abusive astro-turfer himself [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia:Sockpuppet_investigations\/Lagoo_sab\/Archive].

[Folantin]: I've just remembered this dude. He was pretty funny for all the wrong reasons.

See the talk page discussion here [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Talk:Moses_und_Aron#.27Aaron.27....3F.21.3F]. When pointed out that Grove refers to the opera as ''Moses and Aaron'', he counters \""Grove is not infallible or unchallengeable\"" and \""by all means look to Grove for style. But substance trumps style -- and on this point of substance,'''Grove is simply wrong.'''\"" At that point I remembered I had come across the guy before at [[Talk:Boris Godunov (opera)]] where he was having a similar fight over the spelling of \""Mussorgsky\"" where he claims \""A person without a major character disorder would be happy to have a mere wiki article agree with a generally accepted academic source like the 'New Grove' -- which, sane people may wish to know, calls the composer 'Musorgsky [Mussorgsky; Moussorgsky]'.\"" Heh. --"

Martin tamb,False,"[Martin tamb]: Please tell me why you keep excluding the caps from the [[2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup]] for [[Nilmar Honorato da Silva|Nilmar]] and [[Carlos Alberto de Jesus]]. I know that Brazil are sending their Olympic team to the tournament, but the tournament is an official senior team tournament, therefore the caps was included for the Brazil senior team. Other players such as [[Maicon Douglas Sisenando|Maicon]], [[Kak\xe1]] and [[Robinho]] have their Gold Cup caps included in the senior team caps and was recognized by FIFA (FIFA officially recognized Robinho's first cap in the Gold Cup match against Mexico, see [http:\/\/www.fifa.com\/confederationscup\/players\/player=194815\/profile.html Robinho's profile on FIFA]) and RSSSF (see their total caps at [http:\/\/www.rsssf.com\/miscellaneous\/braz-recintlp.html RSSSF page]). \u2014
[Martin tamb]: Please see this [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Football#Brazil international caps]] discussion. \u2014
[Martin tamb]: I know that they played with the U-23, but it is senior tournament and Brazil U-23 played vs other senior national team, so FIFA add the games and goals to the senior team. RSSSF also says that the games is Brazil \""A\"" matches in [http:\/\/www.chancedegol.com.br\/rsssfbrasil\/sel\/brazila.htm here]. If it was not included in the main, then why does [[Robinho#International statistics]] includes the Gold Cup games, and also FIFA clearly says [http:\/\/www.fifa.com\/confederationscup\/players\/player=194815\/profile.html here] that Robinho's first senior game was vs Mexico in the Gold Cup. Also [[Kak\xe1#International goals]] and [[Maicon Douglas Sisenando#International statistics]] includes the Gold Cup games and goals. \u2014
[Martin tamb]: Also [http:\/\/www.fifa.com\/confederationscup\/players\/player=298628\/profile.html Nilmar's FIFA page] says that his first senior game is on 2003 vs Mexico which is a Gold Cup match, and also he already had 8 games and 2 goals as of June 28, 2009. \u2014
[Martin tamb]: Sorry about the page moving of [[Mark Davis (NBA)]] and [[Mark Davis (1980s NBA player)]] which contradict the previous [[WP:RM]] discussions. I didn't notice about that until after I moved them. But I still think those articles shall be moved and I have started a proper steps for requesting a move in their talk pages. \u2014
[Martin tamb]: Well, it's just something I experimented last weekend and it's gonna take a long time to finish. I just think that the article is in a poor shape and it would be nice if it could be improved. Do you have any suggestion on the table layout or the inclusion criteria or anything in general? Feel free to edit my sandbox, any help is appreciated. On a different subject, what do you think of [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=1978_NBA_Draft&diff=389140413&oldid=389138642 this]? Do you think this is good addition or excessive? \u2014
[Martin tamb]: I think it could be explained in the notes. His nationality should show him as an Australian, because he represents them internationally. His Danish citizenship isn't that important because he will never represent them internationally. He probably obtained the Danish citizenship so that he could play in Europe with an [[European Union|EU]] passport and avoid working visa problem. The problem lies for a player who has not represent any country, such as [[Joakim Noah]] and [[Earl Watson]], even though they have declared an intent to represent France and Mexico respectively. Should they be listed there? \u2014
[Martin tamb]: Yeah, that could work. By the way, I've decided to put the edit live on the mainspace, rather than doing it in the sandbox. Currently, each country has their own table, but when all countries are finished, we could easily merge the tables. This will reduce the chance of edit conflict and probably encourage some other editor to participate. \u2014
[Martin tamb]: I've done some research and it turns out that his father is a Nigerian diplomat who worked in London and he does not have British passport.[http:\/\/lubbockonline.com\/stories\/111798\/LS0427.shtml] So, he should be listed under Nigeria. Another difficult case happens with [[Kelenna Azubuike]]. He was born in London to Nigerian parents but he is unable to obtain British passport.[http:\/\/www.timesonline.co.uk\/tol\/sport\/more_sport\/us_sport\/article3111497.ece] He grew up in the United States and probably has U.S. citizenship, but I can't found any reliable source that mention this. For now, I've put him under Nigeria, though I'm not really sure whether he has Nigerian citizenship or not. \u2014
[Martin tamb]: Sorry for the late reply, I've been pretty busy in the last few days, but I'll be doing some work on the list this weekend. I've notice the basketball-reference page and it's been very useful. I've found two interesting lists of basketball players (some are not NBA players) nationalities [http:\/\/www.shamsports.com\/content\/pages\/data\/world\/nationalities.jsp here][http:\/\/nbahoopsonline.com\/History\/internationalplayers.html]. They can't be used as citation but they can be useful as guidelines for more research. I'll continue the discussion on the players on the article's talk page. \u2014
[Martin tamb]: Yeah it's really difficult to organize. Some players have represented more than one national team (see Alexander Volkov). Some players were also born on different place than his nationality (see Damir Markota). I'll dig into those former [[Soviet Union]] and [[SFR Yugoslavia]]n players later, hopefully tonight. \u2014
[Martin tamb]: By the way, [http:\/\/www.fibaeurope.com FIBA Europe website] has all the player information. It's very useful for European players. \u2014
[Martin tamb]: Agree. By the way, do you have any opinion on where [[Kelenna Azubuike]] should be listed? Right now I'm leaning towards listing him under Great Britain with the notes explaining that he could not represent Great Britain because he does not have British passport yet. Also, I couldn't verify whether he has Nigerian or U.S. citizenship. \u2014
[Martin tamb]: Number of games played is not a good idea, we have the active and former players all in one table and I think it would be difficult to manage them. However, number of seasons played will be good addition to the list, complementing the active years in the NBA. \u2014
[Martin tamb]: Thanks! You helped me a lot along the way. \u2014
[Martin tamb]: Sure, I'll help you with this. I never really work on a movie article, but this is really interesting. I loved this movie when I was a kid and I would love to see this became a GA. I'll try to start working on this tomorrow or in the next few days. \u2014
[Martin tamb]: I've bookmarked these links because I've been planning to create those Draft articles as well. Hopefully these will help you on creating those articles. Let me know if you need any help or if there is any problem with the infobox. \u2014
[Martin tamb]: Yeah, been quite busy this week, weekend should be better. Well, player-coaches list would be good for a FL, a nice change from Draft articles. Thanks for the push, I need that. \u2014
[Martin tamb]: Cool, it would be nice to have the awards complete. Anyway, I recently create the [[NBA Development League All-Star Game]]. It has the list of every D-League All-Stars, which could be useful for you when you work with those Draft articles. \u2014
[Martin tamb]: Wow, I did not know that. One click and now I have global account. Thanks for the tips! Anyway the file rename is done and I've inserted it to Williams' article. \u2014
[Martin tamb]: Sure, that's a good piece of information. By the way, I added \""at youth level\"" to make it clearer. Both Villanueva and Hibbert only represented US at youth level and FIBA rules prohibit a player switching national team once they play for a country's senior team. \u2014
[Martin tamb]: What do you think of these ideas? By the way, why does [[List of Los Angeles Clippers head coaches]] need to be reviewed again? It's already an FL. \u2014
[Martin tamb]: Well, I like the idea of having a combined list, but I'm concerned about the length of the article. There list currently has 84 entries but there is a total of 293 head coaches in the NBA (excluding ABA). \u2014
[Martin tamb]: {{outdent}} I don't like the idea of splitting the list for the reasons you just said. After I done a little research, there is no problem with the number of entries, there is [[List of members of the Baseball Hall of Fame|an FL with almost 300 entries]]. The only problem is the article size. Maybe we should try to add all the coaches first and see whether the list has article size problem. If there is a problem, we could reduce the some of the details on the table. I'll work on adding more coaches gradually in the next few days. \u2014
[Martin tamb]: One more thing before I started adding more head coaches, what should be the default sort order? Alphabetical or number of games coached? I think if it's gonna be a complete list, it should be listed alphabetically. It's better to decide this now and reorder the 84 entries now (if needed) rather than reorder the whole 293 entries. \u2014
[Martin tamb]: I agree on the images, I've moved [[Don Nelson]]'s image in the lead as the coach with most wins in NBA history and remove the other images which can be found easily on the teams' head coaches list. However, I don't think we should abbreviate the team name. It would be difficult to understand, even for the readers with NBA knowledge, because most of the abbreviations for the teams' former names and defunct teams' names are not commonly used (such as: NOJ for New Orleans Jazz, SDR for San Diego Rockets, etc). Also, how to abbreviate the [[Baltimore Bullets (original)|original Baltimore Bullets]], the [[Washington Wizards|other Baltimore Bullets]], the [[Denver Nuggets (original)|original Denver Nuggets]] and the current [[Denver Nuggets]]. Let's just hold on from doing this until the article size issue arise. \u2014
[Martin tamb]: Thanks, I've notice that a few days ago, but I haven't read it thoroughly. Certainly it's an interesting reading and it could help to improve the NBA articles. \u2014
[Martin tamb]: Hey, I just noticed the essay on the use of \""comprised of\"" in your subpage and I find it very interesting. I would like to ask your opinion on the use of \""comprising\"" in the articles that I often edited. In the last sentence in the first paragraph of the [[NBA Draft]] articles, for example in the [[1984 NBA Draft]], there is a sentence \""The draft consisted of 10 rounds comprising the selection of 228 players.\"" I wonder if the use of comprise is correct in this sentence. Initially, I used the sentence \""The draft consisted of 10 rounds with 228 players selected.\"" in the [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=1984_NBA_Draft&oldid=346429091 older version of this article], but during the [[WP:FLC|Featured List]] review, a reviewer changed the sentence and use comprise. I'm not a native English speaker and I rarely use the word comprising in a sentence, therefore until now I still think the sentence looks a little weird. What do you think about this, and do you have any suggestion on the words that are better suited for this sentence? Thanks! \u2014
[Martin tamb]: The 10 rounds was designed to select 230 players (23 teams x 10 rounds) from a pool of eligible players, which could be hundreds. But in reality, only 228 players were selected because some teams may forfeit some of their selections due to various reasons. So the second point, that the 10 rounds ultimately resulted in the selection of 228 players, is correct. However, using \""The draft consists of 10 rounds that selected 228 players\"" still seems a little weird, because in my opinion, the sentence implied that the draft selected 228 players, where actually the 13 teams selected 228 players during the draft. Anyway, thanks for the suggestions, I'll try to figure out some other alternative sentences that avoid the use of \""comprise\"" but still have the same meaning as I intended. Any more suggestion would be greatly appreciated but I won't take more of your time on this. Thanks! \u2014
[Martin tamb]: I recently started a discussion in [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject College Basketball#Template:College]] about starting a new template similar to [[:Template:College]] exclusively for U.S. colleges with links to the college's basketball article (if they exist). I'll be using the #switch function similar to [[:Template:College]] and [[:Template:NBA color]], but it would take some time to write all 360+ schools in there. Since you are more experienced with codes\/scripts\/programming, I would like to ask for your opinion, is this the best way to create this template? Are there any easier way to do this? Thanks. \u2014
[Martin tamb]: Then I'll just copy and paste all of them at once into wikipedia. Using excel also helps on the sorting. The content of my excel file itself came from the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject College Basketball\/Master Table|WP:CBBALL\/Master Table]]. Creating the template should be quick, but right now, I'm on the process of checking each link on the Master Table, which take awhile to finish. The only thing need to be done manually is adding the school's alternative names, such as <code>UNC Charlotte<\/code> to the code above. \u2014
[Martin tamb]: Thanks, it helps a lot. Anyway, sorry for the delay, I've been busy editing other articles, but I still work on the college template in my spare time. \u2014
[Martin tamb]: Sure. I'll be around. I've added it to my watchlist. \u2014
[Martin tamb]: Is this [[List of 2011\u201312 NBA season transactions#Free agency]] section is gonna be used to list all free agents? Since the NBA.com Free Agent Tracker is gone, I think it would worth listing them here. [http:\/\/sports.espn.go.com\/nba\/news\/story?page=FreeAgents-11-12 ESPN] and [http:\/\/hoopshype.com\/free_agency.htm HoopsHype] could be the source for this. Anyway, just to let you know that [http:\/\/hoopshype.com\/transactions.htm HoopsHype Transactions] and [http:\/\/www.euroleague.net\/euroleaguenews\/transactions\/2011-12-signings Euroleague 2011-12 signings] would come in handy for players going overseas. \u2014

[Skb8721]: Hi again, I just added the photo of Lew Walt at Quantico, ca. 1945.  I didn't list his rank in the photo caption, because I'm confused as to whether or not he was a Major or a Lt. Colonel at the time.  Is the only difference in the lapel and garrison hat insignia the color of the oak leaf (gold for majors, silver for lt. colonel)?  It's a B&W photo anyway, but I'm just curious about this matter.  Perhaps you could add the correct rank to the Quantico photo?  By the way, I spoke with a relative of General Walt who told me Walt was buried in Quantico National Cemetery, not Arlington; so I changed this information in the article, and included a citation linked to the V.A. grave site web page, which does indeed show him as buried in Quantico.  --

[Skb8721]: P.S.  I notice NDGP, who changed \""Acadiana\"" to \""Cajun Country,\"" has been a Wikipedian for less than a year, and, if I read his page correctly, he has spent little more than a week in Louisiana.  I find it rather presumptious of him to swoop in and make such a drastic change -- a change the site warns against when one is about to rename a page.  I resent the fact the we must now \""discuss\"" something that, to me, is self-evident (that \""Acadiana\"" should be the true title of the page) and something that should not have been tinkered with in the first place.  --
[Skb8721]: Yes, I've seen that error elsewhere; I think they mean the \""Cajun Heartland\"" region, which is different than \""Acadiana.\""  --
[Skb8721]: P.S.  So what's next?  I tried to fix the matter on my own, but I'm unable to do so.  --
[Skb8721]: Hi, can you provide a reference for the additional information you provided regarding the etymology of \""coonass\""?  Thanks, --
[Skb8721]: Frankly, however, I don't think the possible ''cajunes'' link regarding \""coonass\"" should be mentioned in the article unless there's a verifiable source.  Sincerely, --
[Skb8721]: I see that a user named Nintala has gone through and rendered many Louisiana place names in French.  For example, Avery Island is now parenthetically referred to as \xcele d'Avery.  There is no harm in this, except it seems to me that someone is using Wikipedia to advance their own linguistic activism.  I mean, why not render Louisiana place names in Spanish, too?  Where does one stop?  Furthermore, I don't know any local French speakers who call Avery Island \""\xcele d'Avery\"" -- rather, they call it in French \""La Saline\"" or they just interject the usual English expression into their French.  What to do?  --
[Skb8721]: This reminds me of a trilingual street sign in New Iberia, where downtown street names are rendered in English, French, and Spanish.  The sign for \""French Street\"" is translated as \""Rue Francaise\"" and \""Calle Francesa\"" -- but French Street in New Iberia was named for the French family, so the correct translation should have been \""Rue French\"" and \""Calle French\"".  The intention was good, but the results were misleading.  --
[Skb8721]: Aaron Charles, I see you added a note to Nintala's page; I have now done likewise, noting that literal translation of placenames can merely lead to trouble, and using Avery Island as an example of how the matter is more complicated than it may seem.  But, now, do we undo what Nintala has done?  --

[The Anome]: I looked at all en: articles where the en: article belonged to one of the Polish {{tl|coord missing}} categories, and where the pl: article pointed to by the en: article's interwiki also contained an unambiguous and well-formatted external coordinate link. A number of special cases will have got missed due to a number of shortcuts I took to make the job easier, but manual spot-checking seems to show that this bot pass has been fairly successful in catching most of the remaining cases. --
[The Anome]: You're welcome. [[User:Kotniski]] is indded the expert on this; they have already given me a great deal of help on this, by setting up the gmina bounding boxes used by the cross-correlation program. I'm now taking a look at the OpenStreetMap data set for Poland, to see if it has any data that might be of use. --
[The Anome]: I've now taken a look at the OpenStreetMap data for Poland: it's in a well-thought-out XML format which is surprisingly easy to parse and analyze, but, on inspecting the data, all of the easy match-ups to Wikipedia seem to have been done already, with only partial data for the remaining 500 possible candidates for matching. --

[The Anome]: Please see http:\/\/www.google.co.uk\/search?q=%2240Gbit+Ethernet%22 and http:\/\/www.google.co.uk\/search?q=%22100Gbit+Ethernet%22 --
[The Anome]: Can you be more specific about the nature of the POV you believe me to be pushing? I'm not aware of anything in my contributions that might be controversial within the context of Wikipedia's [[WP:NPOV]] policies. --
[The Anome]: I'm fine with whatever the LGBT Wikia decides about that article. --
[The Anome]: Can you provide any [[WP:V|verifiable]] cites from multiple [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] to back those up? If so, you might want to add them to the article, following Wikipedia's [[WP:NPOV]] policy (remebering to bear in mind [[WP:UNDUE]]). --
[The Anome]: Hi! [[:Category:K\u014dchi Prefecture articles missing geocoordinate data]] already exists, so that's already sorted: the bot will recognise both \""K\u014dchi\"" and \""Kochi\"" as spellings of the prefecture name. The Japanese dam articles sound interesting: there's not a lot of geocoding on jawiki, so I'll take a look. --
[The Anome]: Update: I've fixed the tags in those articles to point to [[:Category:K\u014dchi Prefecture articles missing geocoordinate data]] instead. I'll soft-redirect your category [[:Category:Kochi Prefecture articles missing geocoordinate data]] to the older category. --
[The Anome]: Thanks. I've removed the coordinates from the pl: article as well. --
[The Anome]: Do you know of a suitable list of codes I can use for this purpose? Failing that, I guess I can parse the relevant data out of [[ISO 3166-2:MX]] and similar articles, but it seems like a brute-force (and non-authoritative, because this is Wikipedia) way of doing it. In the meantime, I will stop the bot edits. --
[The Anome]: Yes, I can do that. Can you give me some examples? I can do that in the bot heuristics, once I've done the work above to validate the region codes. --
[The Anome]: I'd greatly appreciate it if you could provide me with two or three diffs of the bad edits, so I can double-check what's going on by hand. --
[The Anome]: I've compiled a list of the bad ones I've seen so far. See [[User:The Anome\/pages with bad subregion codes in geotemplates]]. --
[The Anome]: I've gone over the list on that page, and I think they are probably all correctly fixed now. --
[The Anome]: Interesting. XA is part of the private use area in ISO 3166-2, and seems to be being used here to mean \""ocean\"", \""international waters\"" or similar. Since it isn't an official code, I'll suppress it from my bot edits. --
[The Anome]: ''Update'': I've now found and fixed the remaining 10 of the 15 region:XA entries added by my recent bot run. --
[The Anome]: OK. I'm going to start by investigating the aircraft ones, and then move on to ships later. [http:\/\/toolserver.org\/~daniel\/WikiSense\/CategoryIntersect.php?wikilang=en&wikifam=.wikipedia.org&basecat=Aircraft_by_manufacturer&basedeep=3&mode=ts&templates=coord|coord+missing&go=Scan&format=wiki&userlang=en This CatScan search] (edited [[User:The Anome\/Aircraft coord catscan results 2010-12-30|results]]) should find the entries that have been added mistakenly to aircraft articles so far. It's not as simple as it might seem: some air accidents are listed under aircraft subcategories, but are valid candidates for coordinates, so I can't just use the keyword \""aircraft\"" to filter these. I'll think about it more, and try to come up with a better heuristic. --
[The Anome]: <code>\""aircraft\"" and not (\""accidents\"" or \""incidents\"")<\/code> is ''nearly'' enough to do it, but misses some cases of individual aircraft that are on public display. More to come. --
[The Anome]: <code>\""aircraft\"" and not (\""accidents\"" or \""incidents\"" or \""individual\"")<\/code> nails it for all the cases I've seen so far. I've added this to the bot code, and will now clean up the existing outliers by hand. Next, ships. --
[The Anome]: Thanks for spotting that: it's clearly an error, and I can't really see where the coordinates might have come from within the Kolossus dump: I can't see any trace of it in the eo: article. I've now added operas to the class of creative works to which my bot will no longer add geocodes. And, while I'm at it, poems as well, making my category keyword block list for this now <code>[\""songs\"", \""albums\"", \""novels\"", \""stories\"", \""anthems\"", \""musicals\"", \""poems\"", \""books\"", \""plays\"", \""films\"", \""movies\"", \""novellas\"", \""documentaries\"", \""operas\""]<\/code> --
[The Anome]: Found it. It was a bad interwiki from http:\/\/eo.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Carmen_%28komunumo_en_Campeche%29 . --
[The Anome]: I haven't seen any examples of bad ship edits yet: the one you cited, the USS Enterprise CVN-65, is correct, as that appears to be the current at least semi-permanent, and possibly final, location of that particular ship. If you can show me some bad ship edits, I'd be happy to hunt down other similar examples and fix them, in the same way as the above. --
[The Anome]: ''Update'': I've finished my review of the geocoded aircraft articles that seemed worth a second look, see [[User:The Anome\/Aircraft coord catscan results 2010-12-30]]. --
[The Anome]: By the way, since you're online at the moment, I wonder if you could do me a favor and take a look at the geobox for [[El Hondo]], which seems completely broken? --
[The Anome]: I wonder if something similar might be possible for Canada? I can't currently see any licensing information for either the BCGNIS or CGNDB -- if it can be shown that they can be used under Wikipedia's licensing terms, I'd be happy to give this a go. --
[The Anome]: Argh! Please accept my apologies. Unfortunately, it's pretty much impossible to make 6000+ bot edits and not have the bot make the occasional nonsense edit, particularly when it's taking human-entered data from one wiki and adding it to another. Thanks for correcting both of these: I'll take a look, and add heuristics to the bot to make sure similar errors do not happen in future. --
[The Anome]: OK, \""sports\"" and \""ingredients\"" are now added to the bot's category keyword blacklist. --
[The Anome]: It will keep on getting better, I promise, and I have lots of other cool geodata stuff on the way. Also: I've just added <code>\""ballets\""<\/code> and <code>\""treaties\""<\/code> to the list of things it won't geocode. --
[The Anome]: Thank you! --
[The Anome]: And <code>\""firms\""<\/code> --
[The Anome]: I agree. The coordinate was taken from [[:hu:Ekall\xe1tum]], which I think has it as a hypothetical location. I have filters that try to prevent the auto-geocoding of ancient sites, for exactly this sort of reason, but this time they failed. Thanks for spotting this: I've backed off the change. --
[The Anome]: I've closed this AfD as a '''speedy keep''', per the comments there, and then finished the merge proposed by a majority of submitters. --
[The Anome]: Also: looking at the edit to [[Light]] has given me some more ideas about filtering: I'll take a look at taking the output of the bot's {{tl|coord missing}} generator and using to filter interwiki coordinate copies: this should suppress most of the recent weird edits. Kind regards, --
[The Anome]: Sure. I'll take a look a bit later. Did you get your data from the .mdb file mentioned in http:\/\/nrhp.focus.nps.gov\/natreg\/docs\/Download.html#spatial ? They also state there that their data uses the [[NAD27]] datum, which can be up to 200m off from the [[WGS84]] coordinate system Wikipedia uses, for a given place in the continental U.S.: http:\/\/www.ngs.noaa.gov\/cgi-bin\/nadcon.prl offers a conversion service from NAD27 to [[NAD83]]: [http:\/\/gpsinformation.net\/main\/ngs-accuracy.txt this] claims that NAD83 is in general within 2 meters of agreement with WGS84, which is good enough for most non-cadastral, non-technical purposes, and certainly much better than the accuracy required for this purpose. Of course, you should always spot-check a small sample of your output against ground truth with something like Google Maps to sanity check it before trusting any conversions. --
[The Anome]: --
[The Anome]: --
[The Anome]: Now updated to deal with occasional records with broken HTML. --
[The Anome]: I fear they might have intellectual property issues about donating coordinates to Wikipedia. There are certainly a number of iPhone apps that can show you the nearest features on Wikipedia to your current location, \""Vicinity\"" being a good example. --
[The Anome]: If you see any similar articles, instead of simply deleting the file header and leaving it, you might want to call an admin's attention to the article, so they can do a similar job. --
[The Anome]: Sure. I thought I was already blacklisting storms -- can you please give me an example of each of these cases, and I'll check them out. --
[The Anome]: I got it from the Wikipedia-World databased generated by the geographic coordinates wikiproject on the German-language Wikipedia. Unfortunately, this does not seem to tie up with anything reasonable in this case. I'll investigate. --
[The Anome]: Thank you! That's really cool! --
[The Anome]: I'm an admin. Although I'm in favour of the move, it would be inappropriate for me to move the article just because I think it's a good idea -- we need to let the formal renaming process continue, and see what comes of that. In order to do that, we need to keep the discussion all in one place on the article's talk page, and not refactor it anywhere else. --
[The Anome]: Agreed. I've removed the coordinates, which were copied from the de: article. --
[The Anome]: That's fantastic. If we could have more editors like you, we'd have no backlog at all! --
[The Anome]: I do (or try to). These weren't recognized as such because they were in scientific notation, and also not exactly at zero-zero. As far as I can see, these were the only three tags added by my bot which match the regexp \""[0-9][Ee]-\"", so that should have got them all. I'll add some more rules to exclude this type of tag in future -- we shouldn't be using scientific notation in coordinates at all. --
[The Anome]: Done. --
[The Anome]: Hello! Sorry about the delay in getting back to you. Can you give me some links to the missing articles pages containing these coordinates? Have you spot-checked any of them for accuracy? If so, and if I can easily data-mine the coordinates from those pages, I'd be happy to put them into the articles using my bot. --
[The Anome]: I've just double-checked the lists, and found a fair degree of name duplication, which suggests that there are still disambiguation problems -- I've now gone over the lists again, and only generated entries for those articles with only one occurrence in those lists. I've now reverted the edits already made to the articles with questionable coordinates, and will set the bot off again in a moment. --
[The Anome]: Thanks! --
[The Anome]: Thanks! --
[The Anome]: Thanks for spotting it and fixing it. The simple-minded bot thought it was an airport, because it was listed under [[:Category:Airports in the United States]] without containing any features that would have hit the blacklist it uses to try to detect non-place articles. Althogh the bot should not attempt to add the tag again, I've re-categorised the article under [[:Category:Aviation in the United States]], which is I think in any case a clearer and more appropriate category for this article. --
[The Anome]: I've now stopped the auto-generation of locations for Nigeria place articles, and rolled back all such geotags recently added by the bot that have not subsequently been altered by other editors. --
[The Anome]: Thanks for catching that: zero-zero coordinates are a real pain to remove, as I'm constantly surprised by how many variants there can be for expressing them (for example, the recent ones that used scientific notation). I'll take a look to see if I can find any similar ones that slipped through. --
[The Anome]: After taking a quick look, the fr: article template (from which the original coordinates were scraped) seems to default to a weird 0.01 degrees when latitude or longitude is missing. This is truly weird. I've now fixed both articles by hand, using coordinates from the NGA GNS database. --
[The Anome]: And, after reviewing my logs, there were 67 similar cases of 00 00 06 N 00 00 06 E coordinates copied from frwiki by my bot. I'll see what I can do to fix these. --
[The Anome]: {{done}} I've now wound all of these back to {{tl|coord missing}} tags, with the exception of [[Ljenobud]], which I've geocoded. --
[The Anome]: A bit more manual log-grepping revealed a dozen or so more similar errors: however, all of these had already been fixed, by myself or others. --
[The Anome]: If you'd like the article to be restored, see [[Wikipedia:Deletion review]] for how to get an article deletion reviewed, and potentially reversed. --
[The Anome]: I'm on it. --
[The Anome]: These pages try as far as possible to disambiguate village names down to the province\/district level, and omit any entries for villages that have the same name in a single district and therefore cannot be disambiguated. Note that the transliterations in the names do not line up 100% with those used by Wikipedia as standard: if you can identify the mappings that are incorrect, I can go through the list automatically correcting them to Wikipedia standard usage. The same goes for disambiguation formats: if there is a better format, please let me know, and I will regenerate the pages appropriately. --
[The Anome]: Updated to fix some obvious transliteration errors: note that things still need further checking. --
[The Anome]: Thanks for the information about the dab convention -- I've seen it done both ways, and wasn't sure which was standard. Presumably [[Dasht, Kuran Wa Munjan District, Badakhshan]] would be the format for an article that needs disambiguation down to the district level? --
[The Anome]: OK -- I'll tweak my code to try it that way, too, but first, I'll need to check if there are any two villages with the same name ''and'' district name in different provinces: if so, they will have to have the full three-level disambiguation. --
[The Anome]: I think it's now as finished as it can get without proper manual work to check up geographic details. Would you like to take one more quick look to double-check? --
[The Anome]: {{done}} --
[The Anome]: Hello! I've offered some help at [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\/Geographic.org]] on analyzing the Afghan place articles by comparing them with UNOCHA data, and potentially correcting any errors found, where possible, and building a list of the remaining unverifiable articles. Would you be interested in collaborating with me on this? --
[The Anome]: I'm tied up with off-wiki issues at the moment. I'll try to make some progress on this tomorrow. --
[The Anome]: Wikimedia Commons has a bunch of suitably free images of other sorts of bondage hoods -- see http:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/Category:Bondage_hoods and its subcategories -- but I don't think these are what you want. A quick use of other tools to find suitable open-licensed images comes up with nothing. Have you considered making your own image, and uploading it yourself? Cameras are cheap, and all you need is a hood, a broad-minded friend (or a camera with a time-delay and willingness to appear yourself in Wikipedia), and the willingness to go through the necessary processes, including paying attention to any legal issues that may exist. --
[The Anome]: It's a mistake. I've added some categories that would have made the bot recognise it as a person article, but the bot should in any case, having logged itself as having changed the article already, not try to revisit the article in future. --
[The Anome]: I've added \""miniature railways\"" to my list of types of structures: they will be detected in future bot runs. --
[The Anome]: I'd suggest a representative point somewhere in the middle that actually lies on the line itself. --
[The Anome]: If you get a resolution for this issue, I'll be happy to re-enable them: just let me know. --
[The Anome]: Done. --
[The Anome]: Fixed by hand. The bot shouldn't try to code it again. --
[The Anome]: Thank you! --
[The Anome]: The place of the sinking or rescue. I've tried only to add ships that were the subject of such events. If I've tagged any significant number of ships which weren't, please let me know, and I'll try to do another bot run to untag those. Otherwise, if they are few and far between, I suggest you just untag them when you see them. --
[The Anome]: Thanks. That certainly seems to have triggered my filter: I've now activated it to block edits matching its pattern. --
[The Anome]: Agh! The bot had picked the coordinates up from the German-language Wikipedia article. I had thought I had sufficient checks in place to stop things like that from happening, but I was wrong: the bot currently checks for the words \""gods\"", \""goddesses\"", \""deities\"", \""legend\"", \""legends\"", etc. etc. but not \""demons\"". I'll add a few more keyword cut-off tests to stop that from happening again. I've now also checked for other tagging within the category trees you suggested, and removed a more few misplaced {{tl|coord}} and {{tl|coord missing}} tags by hand. Everything else seems to be OK. --
[The Anome]: Thanks for the heads-up. I clearly mis-remembered the GB-LON thing -- fortunately, I've only done a few of these -- trying to be too clever, I'm afraid. I'd greatly appreciate your help in putting the right codes in for these. Regarding Will's Coffee House: I found a quite specific second source for that location via one of the links given in the article, so I'm pretty sure it's the right place. --
[The Anome]: ''Update:'' I think you've got them all. Thanks for fixing them, and for adding the appropriate codes to the category talk page. --
[The Anome]: You're quite right that the username is borderline disruptive, but since they had already qualified for indefblocking as a vandalism-only account, it didn't seem necessary to add that to the block at the time. --"

Drewcifer3000,False,"[Drewcifer3000]: Hi Muchness.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that you tagged a few photos I uploaded.  I'm new to this whole asking for permission and GDFL thing, so although I did get permission I didn't know how to document it.  Thanks to the links you provided I've figured it out and sent off the appropriate correspondences to the appropriate people.  I think everything is under control, and hopefully all of these photos will be taken care of soon.  Thanks for the heads up, and if I miss another step feel free to let me know.
[Drewcifer3000]: Hi Mecu.  This post might seem like its coming from nowhere, and it might be, so bear with me.  Recently, [[User:Zscout370]] reviewed some GFDL permission letters I sent to the OTRS system and deemed the letters to be \""faked.\""  Consequently, [[User:Jeffrey O. Gustafson]] deleted 6 images which I had documented permission for, since Zscout370 had estimated my letters to be forged.  Jeffrey O. Gustafson does not actually have OTRS access, and apparently deleted the images solely based on Zscout370's accusation.  Well, long story short, they weren't faked, and I have been able to get 4 of the 6 images restored by Zscout370.  The remaining two [[:image:Bob Ostertag.jpg]] and [[:image:Cool Calm Pete.jpg]] were deleted presumably before the OTRS correspondences could be reviewed properly, and so Zscout370 doesn't want to restore them.  (I guess just because reviewing the OTRS documents is not what he usually does).  During this process, he referred me to you, since apparently you've reviewed my GFDL permission letters before, and that you might instead be able to restore the images, review the letters, and tag the images appropriately.  I know it seems like out of nowhere that I am asking you this, but Zscout370 thought you'd be the person to talk to.  If that is possible then great, if not perhaps you might be able to suggest another course of action for myself or Zscout370.  Thanks for your time either way.
[Drewcifer3000]: Hey Mecu, thanks for the response.  I don't know of any ticket number unfortunately.  Would you prefer if I was to just re-upload the picture, so that anyone can take a look at the email when the time comes?  It just seems like a potentially sticky situation since they were already deleted once.  Whatever you think is most appropriate. Thanks again.
[Drewcifer3000]: Sounds good.  Thanks for your time.
[Drewcifer3000]: I noticed that you deleted [[:Image:AnotherVersionofthePast.jpg]] since it was not free and not being used, and you rightly deleted it.  Unfortuantely I didn't realize that the image was unused and pending deletion, so I didn't place it back into the article it was intended for.  As far as I can tell, the image was taken out of [[Chronology of the Year Zero alternate reality game]] without any discussion.  I would like to put the image back there, so I was hoping you could undelete the image for me.  I appreciate your help.
[Drewcifer3000]: I believe I have taken care of all of the issues you raised at the NIN FAC.  A few exceptions being the Sharon Tate thing and the copyvio external links.  I explain myself a bit concerning those at the FAC page.  Anyways, if you have any more issues or feel I didn't completely address some of your previous comments please let me know.
[Drewcifer3000]: Oh, ok.  Thanks anyways.
[Drewcifer3000]: Since the NIN FAC has gotten pretty unwieldly, I hid some of your comments (namely the ones that I think have been addressed).  If you feel like a particular comment that I've hidden hasn't been addressed, please feel free to take it out of the hide box.  I just wanted to let you know that I hid the comments to make things manageable and not to discount all of your valid points.  Thanks!
[Drewcifer3000]: Hey, so after a good long while (11 days!) of trying to change the NIN article based on your most recent suggestions, I've kinda hit a brick wall. I commented on the NIN FAC, so I was hoping you could take a look.  It might be easier to take a look at the [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AFeatured_article_candidates%2FNine_Inch_Nails&diff=159569565&oldid=158822973 diff], so you don't have to wade through it all.  Thanks for helping us out so much, and please let me know if I'm totally off the mark or missing the point with my comments.
[Drewcifer3000]: Thanks for the advice.  Unfortunately I don't have any access to such articles.  I'll see about finding some online versions.  Hopefully someone else can help out in that department.
[Drewcifer3000]: Hey man, thanks for the note.  Yea, I do plan on working on some NIN-album articles soon.  Ghosts is at FAC right now, and YZ will be soon. So I guess that leaves the earlier ones, huh?  If you could dig up some older sources that would be awesome man.  I'm definitely planning on picking up the [[33\u2153]] book on Pretty Hate Machine whenever it (finally) comes out, but other than that I'm pretty source-less.  So any help along those lines would be totally appreciated.
[Drewcifer3000]: Yea, Amazong says April, but everwhere I look it says it's not been released yet.  [http:\/\/www.bestwebbuys.com\/Nine_Inch_Nails'_Pretty_Hate_Machine-ISBN_9780826427892.html?isrc=b-search link].  Very strange.
[Drewcifer3000]: Cool man, very nice finds.  Those will definitely come in handy.
[Drewcifer3000]: Hey man.  I was wondering if I could ask a favor.  I've currently got [[Year Zero (album)]] at FAC, and am doing my best to keep up with the suddenly very active FAC.  One user suggested a copy edit from another user.  Think you could help me out on this one?  Even a quick once-over and stuff would be appreciated muchly.  Either way, thanks again for those awesome NIN sources.  I plan on working on the earlier albums shortly.
[Drewcifer3000]: Funny you should mention that: I love doing tables! You got yourself a deal buddy.
[Drewcifer3000]: Good stuff, thanks for the offer.  Is [http:\/\/theninhotline.net\/archives\/articles\/manager\/display_article.php?id=43 this] the one your talking about?
[Drewcifer3000]: Of course!  I used that one like 20 times in the Year Zero page.
[Drewcifer3000]: I think I've addressed or commented on your notes for the GA review of The Slip.  So take a look!
[Drewcifer3000]: Take another look dude!
[Drewcifer3000]: Thanks for the GA review!  My eventual goal with the article is to bring it to FAC, so I've nominated it at peer review to get a few more opinions.  If there's anything else you had to say\/complain about the article, I'd appreciate it if you'd let me know [[Wikipedia:Peer review\/The Slip (album)\/archive1|here]].  Thanks again!  And next time you've got something up at GAN, feel free to ping me and hopefully I can save you the month-long wait for a review.
[Drewcifer3000]: By all means, go for it.  Another set of eyes on the prose would be good.  But I'm watching you!  If there's anything you see but don't feel up to changing yourself, let me know.
[Drewcifer3000]: Yeah, I know.  I guess that's our cross to bear.
[Drewcifer3000]: I seem to be going chronologically backwards... so yeah, might take me a while.  I'm onto With Teeth at the moment.
[Drewcifer3000]: Dude, I think a reorganization would be an awesome idea.  Unfortunately, I have basically no time for Wikipedia for the next month or so (I mean, just check my contributions).  So unfortunately I can't help you with that at the moment.  But by all means, have at it for now!
[Drewcifer3000]: Sounds good man.  Hopefully I'll be done with what I'm doing by late-December, and I'll try and give you a hand then."

[Voidxor]: Understood. I will add secondary sources. I would like to have a few good primary sources too. If acceptable to you, this would be under the conditions that secondary\/tertiary sources outnumber primary and that the primary sources don't look, smell, or taste like spam. I believe working along those lines exceeds the requirements\/expectations of Wikipedia's guidelines. Furthermore it seems to be the precedent set in other list\/comparison articles like [[Comparison of BitTorrent clients]]. &mdash;
[Voidxor]: Expanding the wealth of information on Wikipedia is generally a good thing, especially when it comes to citations. In accordance with being bold (like I did to this citation-neglected article), additions to Wikipedia should only be reverted when they violate some rule or guideline, but ''never'' because somebody feels there's no \""need\"" for something. The burden of proof is on ''you'', intgr, to tell us what rule I violated; it's not on me to justify Wikipedia's necessity for each edit I make. While we have been arguing for quite some time now, you have failed to name one solid reason why my references aren't allowed. You stress the word \""every\"", but I can't find a numerical limit. (Furthermore, you're exaggerating; I had only cited 14 of the 21 listed defraggers.) You also haven't addressed the two comparison articles I gave as examples. If I'm so wrong, then so are several of the primary references in those articles. Let's go remove them too! Now that the spam issue is no longer a concern, why are you still impeding this consensus cycle? &mdash;
[Voidxor]: This conflict is a huge problem for us. Short of modifying Wikipedia policy to address the conflict\/ambiguity, I think I'm going to have to walk a fine line between under-citing the article and over-spamming it. &mdash;"

[Diego Grez]: It is already on Wikinews. [[n:Magnitude 7.2 earthquake hits New Zealand]]. Just '''Do Not Create Articles About News'''! Wikipedia is not a news source, as I have told you reiterated times.
[Diego Grez]: Hi, you don't know me but I know you. You were an admin on Wikinews, and seeing as you're active here on Wikipedia, may I ask you if you could comeback to Wikinews? We are in desperate need of contributors, and from what I've seen you were great on your job. Cheers, --
[Diego Grez]: I'd love if you could respond this... --
[Diego Grez]: Hi Emilio! I got a question regarding the tarea008.py bot on your ToolServer Google Code account. I did some kind of fork of it to make it work on English Wikinews (as [[n:User:Diego Grez Bot]]), but after a few runs, it now refuses to work. May I send you the code by e-mail so you can check it? Thank you in advance, --
[Diego Grez]: E-mail sent. Thank you in advance,
[Diego Grez]: Reply sent. --
[Diego Grez]: It's a shame you are leaving Wikinews, you are a great writer, and it's a great loss. Wanted to note that I published your article, disregarding that you requested its deletion. If I had seen it before, I would had published it before ;) Again, I'm sorry about your decision, and I hope you comeback some day. Cheers, and thanks :)

Tomwsulcer,False,"[Tomwsulcer]: References are bogus. They point to Wikipedia pages in most instances. I did a search in major newspapers about DF -- nada.--
[Tomwsulcer]: What is the problem? Looks like a religious cult is invading Wikipedia. I can't verify any of the DF stuff.--
[Tomwsulcer]: My problem is with the references. I can't verify any of the assertions. Even checking independently, I didn't find anything, except for one reference to a newspaper in Eugene. Whether or not the article remains, it should have good references.--
[Tomwsulcer]: I've run into the same issue, and think your approach is best, that most of the time, it should be lowercase \""p\"" for presidents. Only when talking about a specific president, like \""President Roosevelt\"", then we should capitalize. Good choice.--
[Tomwsulcer]: I had thought Jack Rabid was legit -- born in Summit, a professional musician, with references; wondering why his entry was deleted?--
[Tomwsulcer]: Thanx, yes, I had the same experience a while back, and was about to delete Jack Rabid, but then the refernces checked out so I ended up referencing him instead. But you're right about junk accumulating in small town articles, that's for sure, and thanks for looking out for this stuff.--
[Tomwsulcer]: Update: the [[Jack Rabid]] article was deleted, apparently. But there's still stuff on [[Summit, New Jersey]] about Jack Rabid. So maybe it should be deleted after all? sorry to bother you about this stuff.--
[Tomwsulcer]: Hi Modernist I'm proposing a revamp of Georgina Starr [[User:Tomwsulcer\/my sandbox|here]] in a sandbox page and was wondering what you think. I'm having trouble figuring out the movement or what type of artist she is. If interested, feel free to edit the sandbox page if you like. Also thanks for the picture for [[Handyman]] but I'm not sure if I like it because the workers look so menial and low, but it's a great picture nevertheless.--
[Tomwsulcer]: Hi, I'm working on a revamp of an art article. If interested, check out [[Talk:Combine painting\/sandbox|Combine painting revamp]] and make changes as needed. [[User:Bus stop]] suggested the revamp.--
[Tomwsulcer]: Thanks. I moved the sandbox stuff to the article and kept your additions. Here's a painting by [[Frank Stella]]. Is it an example of \""Combine painting\"" and can I put this image on the article [[Combine painting]]?--
[Tomwsulcer]: Hey Bus stop I thought you were suggesting a revamp on my talk page. This was on my talk page: ''Also I was just noticing that we have a fairly skimpy article on what seems to me a fairly important idea in second half of the twentieth century art \u2014 Combine painting. I just was thinking to bring that to your attention because of its potential relevance to a painting that also contained three dimensional elements. It is actually an interesting idea to have a Jackson Pollack-like painting with a Rauschenberg sensibility to it. Now if we could only find a way to inveigle Andy Warhol's motif into it we might have a genuine art of all time. Bus stop (talk) 17:24, 8 January 2010 (UTC)'' Anyway, when you mentioned how it was a stub, I thought people wanted it expanded. And not quite sure what you mean about Andy Warhol. .--
[Tomwsulcer]: Comment -- if it's the word \""advertise\"" in the line that's the problem, is there a way to say it better? I'm thinking that massage therapists don't make loads of money (particulary in recession) and have trouble making their services known on the web, and this is a free way to do it -- so if you can think of a better way to word it, we'll go with your wording.--
[Tomwsulcer]: I know you're good at article deletions. I hunted for references for this article [[Ross Berkal]] and couldn't find anything in newspapers, magazines, even Christian-oriented sources. It's possible that there are sources; but even when I did a search with just his name, I went through about 5 screenfuls of stuff without finding anything. Just letting you know.--
[Tomwsulcer]: :) My intention was not ''testing your good faith'' but rather acknowledging that you have a skill here in the deleting-articles department, that's all, and when I came across this article I realized your skill in this department might be applicable in this case, that's all.
[Tomwsulcer]: Another dubious article here: [[Chonlathid Krudthiang]]. I did numerous passes looking for references in Thai newspapers (in English), with different spellings, in sports publications, didn't find anything, suggesting [[WP:Notability]] concerns.--
[Tomwsulcer]: If there's a US-related article with high traffic stats, with daily readership of 1000+ readers or more, but the article is in poor shape, let me know. I believe a general priority here at WP is doing stuff that gets read.--
[Tomwsulcer]: Pontificalibus is right. The [[Tahash]] article is out of control.--
[Tomwsulcer]: Hi, I see you're an administrator. I'm seeking advice about [[Tahash]]. It seems like an out-of-control article with [[WP:OR]], with only one or two contributors such as [[User:Michael Paul Heart|this guy]], writing what appears to be a book, with unencyclopedic content, external links inside the article. Myself and others posted concerns [[Wikipedia:No original research\/Noticeboard#Tahash|here]] but without much reaction. So I'm trying to alert administrators to this to see what to do.--
[Tomwsulcer]: Thanks Davewild, I hadn't seen the DGG comment, and I looked up the RfC stuff and may use it. I've worked with DGG before and he's sharp so I think his involvement will be helpful. Thanks again.--
[Tomwsulcer]: I second the kudos to you, David in DC. It's particularly impressive to change courses and be flexible based on new information. I'd award you a barnstar but it wouldn't be big enough to fit on your page. --[[User:Tomwsulcer|Tomwsulcer]] ([[User talk:Tomwsulcer|talk]]) 13:02, 8 January 2011 (UTC) Update: figured out how to fit it: --
[Tomwsulcer]: Question: isn't GRG a primary source? Wikipedia likes secondary sources. Wondering.--
[Tomwsulcer]: Yes, I agree with your editing choice, that \""consisting of\"" is superior to \""comprised of\"", but in a quote, aren't we supposed to keep the original wording??? But, again, I agree -- you're a better writer than the original reporter. :) --
[Tomwsulcer]: Hey, I appreciate working with excellent writers such as yourself. Wikipedia needs good writers. My writing skill level is somewhat stuck in a \""borderline competent\"" category; I try to read poetry to improve but I find myself using tried-and-true but somewhat boring constructions. I'm competent enough as a writer to recognize good writers like you. My biggest writing challenge here at WP is: how do I make factual stuff here interesting? This is something I always wonder about. I hope the Lake Erie revamp wasn't too boring. I would have LOVED to have found a picture of the Snakehead fish with the teeth staring forward but I'm flummoxed by rules about uploading Flickr pictures & such.--
[Tomwsulcer]: I just looked over your \""comprised of\"" project. Cool! Yes I agree with you about technical writing, simplicity, exact words, active vs passive. Didn't know about singular being better than plural, will make a note of that, thanx. About writing, I'm always trying to learn to do it better; I see it as a ''craft'' not as ''art''. And I think we'd agree that ''good writing'' depends greatly on what the purpose is; in a poem, the idea is to open up the possibilities of experience and sensation, while in an encyclopedia, the idea is to give facts. So ideally the best in Wikipedia is short, simple, exact, well-organized, so readers can find facts quickly, so the focus shouldn't be on the writing quality itself (then it's failed because flowery writing is distracting) while in a poem, perhaps, the writer might want readers to hear the rhythm of the rhymes. What I try to do here is hunt for really cool facts, cool quotes, stuff that interests me, and hopefully that will bring readers.--
[Tomwsulcer]: Appreciated.--
[Tomwsulcer]: Ditto Marmaduke Percy's excellent comment. You are a fine Wikipedian, an excellent organizer and bringer-abouter. I've had Wikipedia burnout too; it can get contentious here; in a way, it's kind of like ice hockey -- a venue which encourages people to fight -- rather than something more amiable such as football. But I encourage you to be like a duck, and let it roll off. My WP article \""History of citizenship in the United States\"" was recently deleted (I initially wrote it in a day or so, but within a few months it had come under attack for WP:OR and being essay-like) but I actually felt good about the deletion, because I figured out a way to keep it alive on Google [http:\/\/knol.google.com\/k\/thomas-sulcer\/history-of-citizenship-in-the-united\/38jyd65oa42fm\/5 here]. Now, I have the ONLY version on the web, plus a byline and bypicture. So, things work out for the best. Still, overall, I think Wikipedia is the best place because of the high readership.--
[Tomwsulcer]: This article is up for deletion in case you wanted to weigh in on the subject; I'm kind of on the fence but tilt towards keeping her, but if you wish to add your opinion, it's been about a week now with her article on the chopping block. Also wondering what projects you want us to focus on for the WP US.--
[Tomwsulcer]: Kumioko, Wikipedia is practically set up for battling. It's like playing hockey -- even the nicest people will take the gloves off sooner or later. So, another way of dealing with it is this -- realize it will happen and ''enjoy it when it happens'' but don't take it too seriously, and don't get too ''attached'' to having your way. Sometimes we'll get our way; sometimes we won't; but it also helps, sometimes, to appreciate that the overall back-and-forth helps make the encyclopedia better. I've found that sometimes the best articles result when there's lots of battling, because what happens is that the best things usually stay.--
[Tomwsulcer]: I agree somewhat; I think Wikipedia has always been a battleground of sorts, particularly for some subjects (religion, philosophy, politics etc), so it's hard to assess whether the battling is increasing, diminishing, or staying the same (my guess is staying the same). I was frustrated about a year ago and quit; then I contributed to [[Citizendium]] intensively for about six months, but guess what -- there's battling there too -- like in all online encyclopedias, including RationalWiki and others. What I found is that, despite all its faults, Wikipedia has the ''best readership'' and excellent ''web presence'', meaning, that your contributions here are important, and have an impact worldwide, since what gets written here influences people who count on WP for accuracy and impartiality.--
[Tomwsulcer]: Since a regular barnstar won't suffice, a battleship has been named in your honor for your excellent contributions to U.S. related articles. The keys are in the ignition. Happy cruising!--
[Tomwsulcer]: Of course you can ask your fellow U.S. Wikipedians to take cruises with you on the Atlantic from time to time on it. And you can do all kinds of things to it; perhaps build a swimming pool on it? Or go out in the middle of the ocean and skeet-shoot seagulls with the main battle guns.--
[Tomwsulcer]: Wondering if you might advise about captions for other Philippine desserts [[Philippine_cuisine#Desserts|here]]. I took pictures of them but I dont' know much about them other than I ''wanted'' to eat them but didn't have the money at the time. Thanks for your help on bibingka.--

[Tomwsulcer]: Hi Beth, sure I am interested but am present I am fulfilling a volunteer project for Partisan Records and Knitting Factory Records to write articles on their artists; these record labels have donated generously to Wikimedia Foundation. I would be willing to consider a volunteer project for your artists too but perhaps in a few weeks or so if you're willing to consider a donation to Wikimedia Foundation as well. Or else I could send you a sheet with guidelines about how to add articles to Wikipedia. There's a learning curve but I think in the long run it's a good idea to develop this skill, and I am willing to share ideas about how to create content that passes the rules and doesn't get deleted, if interested. If you google my name you can find my email address most likely.--
[Tomwsulcer]: Noted.--
[Tomwsulcer]: I created it thinking it was more of a term than just a word, but after floating it, I came upon the discussion to delete a previous entry since it's only a definition. If you'd like to delete it speedily please do so; I forgot what tag to put on it or maybe I should have Prodded it.--
[Tomwsulcer]: Hey I was trying to save the article from being deleted. Almost all of the article was unsourced, clearly looked like [[WP:SPAM]], and there were users in the history of the article which looked a lot like the subject of the article. I added valid references which may keep the article from being deleted; there were invalid references before which were removed. As a major contributor, you should know about the importance of references? I saved the material on the talk page -- please find suitable references and restore it when they're found; if you would like my help let me know. And please understand that I understand the irritation when stuff gets deleted; I've had major articles (ie 50-100 references even) deleted; see my user page for an idea about how to use Google ''knols'' as a way around this (like one's own Wikipedia). :) --
[Tomwsulcer]: Please see [[WP:RS]].--
[Tomwsulcer]: David Nathan's profile page at LinkedIn or SoulMusic.com is not a valid reference; I found no mention of him at ReverbNation (when I clicked the link). It's my view that Nathan as an article topic is borderline-notable; the new references I added are a way to try to keep his article in WP (since there is a risk that others will come along and PROD it in a jiffy, given the attention) -- still I sympathize with how you feel.--
[Tomwsulcer]: Agree. The link doesn't say who wrote about Nathan. I'll support you if the article comes up for deletion and vote \""keep\"" but what I'm saying is, based on past experience, that if an article gets challenged, it's survival chance rate drops somewhat (if challenged), perhaps with a 50-50 chance, and keeping the article in its new form (short, well-referenced, neutral-sounding) will likely prevent a challenge. So I hope you might begin to see the editing changes as a good thing. Further, readers coming along and seeing the Nathan article now in its trimmed state will get that ''he's a music writer'' that is, someone to take seriously -- the older version had more information but without references, it looked somewhat promotional -- do you know what i mean -- so I hope you see that by following Wikipedia's rules, the overall product is more powerful. The article, shorter, has more ''ooomph''. ''Less is more'' as you know. Further, if you can find articles that Nathan has written in music-related publications, please let me know.--
[Tomwsulcer]: Thanx. I added info based on what you gave above. Anybody who wrote that extensively about soul music must be an authority on the subject so I added that to the lede sentence. Any way we could get a picture of DN? And an infobox would be good too.--
[Tomwsulcer]: I am an unpaid Wikipedia volunteer, a handyman, living in New Jersey, merely following Wikipedia's rules which suggest that, for starters, a person should not edit their own article, that reliable sources be used which are verifiable, that articles be neutral. I found out about you on the WP noticeboard about conflict of interest. If you are, indeed, Ken Ring, then you should ''not'' be editing your own article because it's clearly a ''conflict of interest'', and you should ''not'' be removing criticism of your deeds by public officials in New Zealand. About you being an astrologer -- if you are making predictions about events on earth, based on events happening to the moon, then my sense is that's astrology -- but there may be a case to make that you don't see yourself as an astrologer, so maybe that should be put into the article? The article in my view is highly biased in your favor -- borderline advertising for you (again, against WP's policies) -- and is not neutral; my additions were a mere way to try to restore some of the balance. Wikipedia is an excellent encyclopedia when people follow the rules, since it leads to objective reporting, factual information. In the end, readers themselves will make up their minds about you; if you are telling the truth, and believe in what you are doing, and if you are as popular as you say and sell 10,000 almanacs, and believe in the veracity of your earthquake predictions, then you shouldn't fret what an article in Wikipedia says, from New Jersey, of all places. Last, this discussion belongs on the talk page of the [[Ken Ring (astrologer)|Ken Ring]] page so I will copy it there.--
[Tomwsulcer]: Thank you for explaining this to me. I understand how you might resent being labeled a \""quasi-mystic mathematician\"" but please understand that ''I'' didn't label you this, rather, a [[WP:RS|reliable source]] which is [[WP:VERIFY|verifiable]] described you with these words. Please take up the issue with them, not me; rather, I am merely following Wikipedia's rules which say that I must quote the sources, that's all. About your not being an astrologer -- well, my sense is that if someone predicts natural events by looking at astronomical or astrological events (eg the moon), then that's astrology; but frankly I'm not an expert here, so maybe there is a case for having your article retitled. Last, and this may be the hardest thing for you to appreciate, but it's true, and I think if you think about it, you'll agree -- and it's this -- that when you are ''criticized'' in the media that this is a ''good thing in one sense'' because it means that people out there in the world are ''listening to you'' and ''heeding what you say''. It's a sincere compliment. And what I'm trying to suggest is that when politicians such as New Zealand's minister Nick Smith criticize you, that you're ''on the public radar''. That is, when your article in Wikipedia has both positives and negatives, that's it's a more serious, better article overall, reflecting a boost in your status, than one which has mere bland pronouncements. Won't you agree here? And, I believe that you believe in your own predictions (right?) -- that is, I believe that you believe that you are not a fraud -- so why worry? You should ''smile'' and enjoy these days. Being human, as you know, is a finite thing, and we should strive to enjoy every moment on the earth because these days will not last forever! Cheers.--
[Tomwsulcer]: Thanks, Avanu. Much appreciated. Let me know how I can help you in future. I remember past kindnesses, like forever.--
[Tomwsulcer]: Thanks, Jeaniac. I wouldn't call myself an ''expert Wikipedian'' by any stretch but I continue to learn new things, new procedures, and I find that other Wikipedians, including you, plus the content itself, helps me keep learning. The current Sallie Ford photo is probably safe now since the record label gave permission, but would you like to upload your photo and perhaps we could include it in the article? If so let me know. Also, you should write something on your user page [[User:Jeaniac|here]] (not just your user talk page) and save it (there's a reason for this). If you took the picture with your own camera, then it's usually possible to upload it. Remember to sign your posts with the four tildes.--
[Tomwsulcer]: Hey, thanks! It's okay to add barnstars to my user page if you wish. And thank you for your improvements as well. For one of the pictures, I thought up a better caption but I'm still kind of in semi-formal probation about the Palin-Revere kerfuffle so perhaps I'll just leave it here on my talk page for now. --
[Tomwsulcer]: Thanks, Richard -- yes thanks for the praise for the good stuff and for criticism for the inaccuracies, and a general thanks for your contributions to Wikipedia. Please feel free to fix things accordingly -- in this case I think it's best since it's a specialist subject, and there are few as knowledgeable as you about this subject. Unfortunately I don't have access to math journals so it's somewhat difficult for me to find good sources on you. I had a few questions: how did you first get interested in pentagrams (my sole knowledge of pentagrams was from the Crosby Stills & Nash song ''[[Guinnevere]]''. Also I tried to follow the logic in the article [[pentagram map]] but it quickly got way beyond me -- I was wondering whether there were simpler ways to get the concept across. I tried drawing a polygon, inscribing diagonals, and making an inner polygon -- I think I did this twice -- resulting in three polygons -- and then spinning them around, expanding the smaller ones -- to see if there were similarities in shape -- I didn't see any but maybe I was doing something wrong, or I don't understand the concept yet. Wondering, also, are there any practical applications for [[geometric group theory]] or [[pentagram map]]?  Like, is this a case where pure mathematics leads, and then some application down the road may come from it, but it's not apparent now? And, can it help somebody win at billiards? Also, if you know how to upload a picture of yourself to Commons, please do so, and tell me the filename so I might add it -- that is if you'd like your picture in Wikipedia -- or else please email me a picture at thomaswrightsulcer (AT) yahoo (DOT) com -- I'm getting better at working thru the permissions.--
[Tomwsulcer]: Hey, thanks! Also I note you have great ideas for improving Wikipedia on your user page. Interesting.--
[Tomwsulcer]: Hey flyer, wondering what you think about [http:\/\/knol.google.com\/k\/thomas-sulcer\/symmetry-in-the-eye-of-the-beholder\/38jyd65oa42fm\/36#view this] -- it's on the topic of why symmetry is related to beauty. My friend Gary and I were hashing about it -- do you know if its original research or whether it's been written about before -- and wondering whether it's true.--
[Tomwsulcer]: I agree the ''knol'' doesn't qualify as a reliable source. I put it there in ''knol'' rather than Wikipedia because ''I know'' that it's an opinion. But I think it's right. What I'm wondering is if you've ever come across it before, and if you think it's right. Perhaps this is one situation in which Wikipedians are ahead of the curve. Or, it may be that I haven't read enough, since I'm not a specialist in the field of beauty. Just wondering, that's all.--
[Tomwsulcer]: And yes Angelina Jolie is pretty and smart, but not super-smart, since she tattooed-up her wonderful body; now why did she do that? Still I've always wondered about feminine beauty, like why it happens, and I continue to think about it.--
[Tomwsulcer]: Thanks, Debbie. Which photo? Is it the one with the sandcastle? If you see an error, please feel free to fix it. You can edit almost anything here at Wikipedia, including pictures. That's how mistakes get fixed -- we correct each other.--
[Tomwsulcer]: Hey Debbie, I updated a beach photo -- did I get the right one [http:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:Sandcastle_on_Waiheke_Island_New_Zealand.jpg#Summary here]? If not let me know, okay? Thanks for your help. --
[Tomwsulcer]: You're welcome. I've been doing Wikipedia for a few years now, and I've developed a slew of shortcuts to do things quickly. In the Dalton article, it only took me a few minutes, if that, to add the references, and a few more minutes for copyediting. When I can I like to rescue articles, since I know how it feels when an article gets deleted (I've had my share of articles getting axed). My favorite stuff is revamping, meaning take a troubled yet high-traffic article, researching, and adding new stuff with a good copyedit, like for [[Hope Diamond]] or [[Equality of outcome]]. If you continue to contribute here, bug me about my secrets and shortcuts and settings; one is you should write something on your user page -- anything -- and save it so your user name doesn't light up in red. Another: remember to sign your name and leave an edit summary. Another: Wikipedia is like camping outdoors and it can get very windy and rainy, fast; references are like strong pegs which hold down your article when the wind picks up. Good luck!--
[Tomwsulcer]: About thinking about your leaving Wikipedia. I've been where you've been. I contributed for about nine months or so when I ran into major hassles -- one long well-researched article that I had written was deleted, offhand, by what I consider to be a biased admin (there were 70+ references although there were some problems with viewpoint); another, my [[Philosophy of Spinoza]] article, was totally overwritten by what appears to be a PhD student so it is now almost impossible to read. I felt unappreciated, unthanked. It's partly the way Wikipedia is set up -- it's not a place where thanks come readily. Many times I've worked on articles and not one person even gave one hint of appreciation. So, I edited a rival encyclopedia, [[Citizendium]], for a while but I found there was battling there too; while the atmosphere was more collegial, few people ever read Citizendium, and trying to improve readership there was frustrating. Part of my issue was that some stuff of mine was POV-ish (I hadn't really confronted this that clearly) other stuff highly factual. So I came back to Wikipedia with a compromise -- that I would put my POV-stuff in [[Google Knol]]s (see my user page if interested) and write the NPOV stuff in Wikipedia. So it's like the best of both worlds. The Google stuff gets much less readership but I have total control over it -- even my picture and name are on my articles -- while I get a kick out of writing stuff in Wikipedia which gets huge readership (sometimes 1000s of views per day). And there's a place for each. And my Google knol [http:\/\/knol.google.com\/k\/thomas-sulcer\/mentally-healthy-mind\/38jyd65oa42fm\/3# Mentally healthy mind] has over 5000 readers which is kind of a surprise to me (but it still needs work).--
[Tomwsulcer]: But let me address your statement above. And my sense is you are taking on too much responsibility and need to approach the project more from a \""it's fun\"" point of view. You wrote ''it's become my job to make sure that things are well-presented and accurate so that not one person leaves this site with the wrong information.'' That's too much responsibility for any one person, in my view. Your mission will make it less fun for you here. Yes, agendas battle here. Yes, there are POVs. Sometimes articles will be wrong. But my view is that, because agendas battle, over time, the best stuff wins out; it's messy but I've come to appreciate that there are lots of people contributing here who know stuff that I don't. It's not perfect. We ''aim'' for perfection but only do our best. While Wikipedia does have its problems, which you are clearly aware of, there are strong pluses too. Your contributions have made a HUGE impact on people all around the world whether you know it or not, like millions, perhaps tens of millions of people, are better informed because of your contributions. I do not see Wikipedia contributing as an \""addiction\"", rather as a hobby; and my advice would be to take it in stride, perhaps back off a bit for a while, but making pronouncements like \""I'm never coming back\"" -- well, you may feel differently in six months or so. Another thing: your experience here is a valuable skill which few people have. Last, if you find yourself getting flustered by the same POV-pushers, drop a line on my talk page and I'll support you if you ask. And really last: if you think there's a ''perfect'' version of an article you'd like to preserve, why not write it as a google knol? That way, it's preserved and you have total control over it. Oops, and really really last (really!) if you have any ideas about the pictures on [[Physical attractiveness]] ie via the talk page, I'm interested in which ones you like and which ones you guess would cause the least edit battling (!!!) --
[Tomwsulcer]: Flyer, while I think ''most'' of the problem here is that Wikipedia can be a difficult environment, I think it is also important for us not to take ourselves too seriously and realize there's a fun aspect. You describe it as \""a job\"" (even if it's a volunteer \""job\"".) You write ''I **have to** revert...''  You didn't write ''I **like** to ...'' I think you're taking stuff here ''too seriously''. I advise: lighten up. Smile.
[Tomwsulcer]: In your case, I think the question you should ask yourself shouldn't be whether to participate in Wikipedia  but ''how'' you do so. We can wear many hats here as you know. We can ''choose'' what we do or not do. For some reason, you've gravitated towards the night watchman & policeman's role which involves tension and conflict and battling. It's a tough role. And, in my view, you're getting tired of the battling. Am I right about this?
[Tomwsulcer]: And while we all police each other to some extent, it's possible to wear other hats which involve much less conflict, such as creating articles, doing disambiguation pages, pictures, etc. What are the things you enjoy most doing? I try to do what I love best here, which is create new articles or improve existing ones and build readers. I avoid the FA and GA processes since these mean lots of fuss; rather, I'll take a mediocre article and try to make it good, more readable, and I enjoy even an occasional compliment. And occasional humor and jokes and jibes are fun too (although I've gotten in trouble for this in the past). It's possible to care, to get things accurate, while having fun.
[Tomwsulcer]: And I find I learn stuff from my contributions here too. For example, I contributed to articles for a record label, and when I met a Nigerian doctor recently, I queried him about such artists as [[Fela Kuti]] and [[Seun Kuti]], and he was impressed that an American knew about Nigerian protest music. It also helps me appreciate different viewpoints on things. It's made me more ''mainstream''.
[Tomwsulcer]: My recommendation would be to shrink your watchlist, and let stuff happen to articles for a bit. It's kind of Buddhist-like, Spinoza-like, to let go a bit, to shrug your shoulders. When my article (which I had worked on for two to three days) ''History of citizenship in the United States'' got whittled down, and then deleted, it didn't faze me much, since I have it preserved as a google knol (with 1000+ readers too). I like the foot in two worlds approach as I said (Wikipedia & Knol.)
[Tomwsulcer]: About Citizendium -- you're right that it was second to the gate, which accounts for much of its lack of success. Still, Citizendium has, in my view, made additional mistakes technically and editorially which Wikipedia hasn't made. Mistakes include: idea of \""expert\"" editors (needless segregating based on dubious qualifications), idea of \""approved\"" version of articles vs \""unapproved\"" (unnecessary layer of fuss), making talk pages invisible for many searches (hurts PageRank), the whole \""forum\"" being separate from the encyclopedia (also hurts PageRank). There are a few very sharp academics in Citizendium quite skilled in a few technical areas who like the collegiality and who are great people. But I find the emphasis on \""expert editors\"" brings a kind of elitist arrogance to the place -- I got treated as a dimwit since I'm a handyman by a few rather sour editor types there. I tried to get Citizendium to change to bring in more readers but the place was resistant to change. I experimented with ways to bring in readers, but to no avail. But a waste of time: Wikipedia is where the action is. Neither encyclopedia has solved the problem of how to rein in errant administrators, or how to deal effectively with disputes, but these are tough problems.
[Tomwsulcer]: Whatever you decide, good luck to you.--
[Tomwsulcer]: There is probably little that people can do since the problem is complex (ie boils down to ''how to police the police'' and this is a toughie problem). About your specific idea -- well -- let me think about it. I'm in favor of openness, criticism, accountability, of a forum where non-admins can criticize admins which will get some kind of attention and not be shunted to some unread page. What admins may not realize is how non-admins can be easily bullied and pushed around here at Wikipedia with only a mouseclick or two. It's so easy for them to do. And it's hard for people such as you and me to respond to such treatment since we lack tools, can be blocked. It's happened to me in the past when a POV-pushing admin deleted an entire article of mine without consensus, without cause. If I am again bullied, I'm prepared to leave Wikipedia and write about the negative treatment elsewhere, such as Google knols, which are gaining readership every day. I urge you to consider posting your issues on Google knols. It's like you're your own admin and have control over what you write (almost entirely). You can post pictures, links, diagrams, references. Great stuff. But readership is limited. Still, it can be found on the web.--
[Tomwsulcer]: I disagree with your decision to close discussion on the Surturz matter.--
[Tomwsulcer]: Most certainly. I feel the Surturz issue isn't resolved. An admin deleting a page in a user's userspace is (as I see it) a kind of coverup and stifling of dissent; and I see your decision to close discussion as the same kind of thing but in a less obnoxious form. Further, I think there are bigger implications behind this matter which are unresolved yet which are still highly important to address. The underlying thorny issue, as I see it, is -- how to rein in errant administrators, or maybe, ''how to police the police''. As a non-admin, while I've contributed here perhaps two years, I still feel like if I ever get into a conflict with an admin that I will lose and there ''nothing'' that I could do about it. I do not know where to try to get relief. I do not trust the other avenues since I doubt they are read much and I don't know how to use them. So I don't see it as fair. The issues touch on deeper issues, such as free speech, democracy, criticism, and what I am saying is that Wikipedia is a battleground at times, but that the battling is good in many situations (since it helps us think, it exposes us to opposing views) but it can be ''uncomfortable'' as well. So I hope the discussion is kept going.--
[Tomwsulcer]: Thanks for explaining. I think you're being reasonable. And I think your outlook and motives are good. I don't know much about DRV but perhaps I should learn. Overall I think these issues are complex and I wish I had better answers. I can see the contrasting point of view too, that without some kind of censoring, Wikipedia could easily get out of control. What I've been thinking recently is somewhat along the lines of the US judicial system in the sense of a [[Miranda warning]], that is, some obligation on the part of an administrator when doing something punitive, to inform the person being punished (eg block, deletion, etc) of a forum to go to where they can argue their case to have the penalty undone or disputed or whatever. Ideally I'd like a quick-stop courtroom with hopefully simple and fast procedures which dispensed some kind of justice (MacJustice? -- ok I'm an American and free to laugh at my nation's way of approaching things.). But how such a thing would be arranged -- that's beyond me. The ANI noticeboard is highly read and seems to be serving as a kind of court of sorts.--
[Tomwsulcer]: Good to know. Thanks!--
[Tomwsulcer]: Oh, thank you Serge. I did this a while back. I had forgotten it was there. It was a huge surprise to see it there and kind of refreshing to know that I was still goofy back then. I've been working on related articles such as [[physical attractiveness]] and [[beauty]] and [[facial symmetry]] recently but the subject of ''why'' women are beautiful continues to baffle me. I stumbled into some progress recently with a [http:\/\/knol.google.com\/k\/thomas-sulcer\/symmetry-in-the-eye-of-the-beholder\/38jyd65oa42fm\/36# hypothesis about how symmetry is attractive] and learned that biologists were pretty much on to this already. Btw, I have knols which I need pictures for -- like [http:\/\/knol.google.com\/k\/thomas-sulcer\/dating-and-mating-in-the-twenty-tens\/38jyd65oa42fm\/1# Dating and mating in the twenty tens] and my screenplay [http:\/\/knol.google.com\/k\/thomas-sulcer\/fifteenth-reunion\/38jyd65oa42fm\/2# Fifteenth Reunion]. I'm seeking young good-looking people to be in photos to illustrate the points. If you know people willing to be in the photos let me know.--
[Tomwsulcer]: The problem as you probably agree is the difficulty of ''policing the police'', that is, of how to rein in errant administrators while permitting the good ones to keep the project from spinning out of control. And I have no good answers here. When possible, I think that at the very least, that non-admins be allowed to complain about admin choices in their userspace. Still, I thank you for your view on this subject.--
[Tomwsulcer]: Oh, sorry, I didn't mean the baskets as a plea for a reply, rather, as a quasi-whimsical joke of sorts, and I've found on Wikipedia that it's our duty to enjoy the little things, pictures, jokes, insights, and that I should try to make this place fun for people as best I can.--
[Tomwsulcer]: Oh.--
[Tomwsulcer]: I see your point.--
[Tomwsulcer]: It's a subtle distinction, isn't it, between research which is ''new'' and research which is summarizing past research. I had pretty much understood this idea from contributing here over several years -- like the idea sinks in over time, that we can't say something directly about subject Z, but we can say that reputable source X said statement Y about subject Z. It's kind of had the effect of moving me more towards a mainstream way of thinking about things (I was more radical perhaps even five years ago). I had been working on so many different types of articles and perhaps what happened is that I oversimplified in my own mind with a rule to myself that \""if a statement in Wikipedia has a reference then it isn't original and therefore worthy of inclusion\"", but now that you put it like you do, I see how even referenced data could be seen as \""original\"". What you're saying is that it's more than that -- that our overall purpose can't be to research something (and use references to back up our research) but rather to summarize research done by others. It's a sometimes subtle distinction, isn't it? To get information about what experts have written or said about a subject, we have to ''research'' the ''research'' (!).--
[Tomwsulcer]: Tough concept. I get it now. Thanks for your explanation.--
[Tomwsulcer]: And reviewing the [[User:Tomwsulcer\/Terrorism prevention strategies|userfied article on Terrorism Prevention Strategies]], again from your viewpoint, I can see how it is research -- essentially unpublished research -- although the individual ''pieces'' within it, possibly, might be added to other existing Wikipedia articles, possibly helpful in some other context.--
[Tomwsulcer]: So I'm kind of trying to figure out how I misunderstood this. And, rethinking about this (researching! oh no!), perhaps it was because I worked on many different types of subjects here at Wikipedia besides strictly academic ones, and got used to having different standards which are in effect and which are understood implicitly and in practice and which are not as tightly defined as your reading of Wikipedia's [[WP:OR|no original research]] policy. For example, other types of articles, such as biographies of musical artists, are not seen as academic subjects but rather as, well, just subjects -- pop culture phenomena. It is unlikely that any academic will publish a dissertation on Algerian singer [[Rachid Taha]] (or if so, would anybody want to read it?) And when I revamped this article a month or so ago (btw part of a project to help get Wikimedia Foundation a donation check) what was important was references; like, ''I'' couldn't say Rachid Taha was a popular singer, but I could say that ''a newspaper music critic'' said so. And I think the community will find that the Taha article is good and encyclopedic. And I bet if we think about it, there are different types of standards applied depending on the type of article. Like, [[Kitchen cabinet]] which I copyedited perhaps a year ago has few references, is unlikely to be a serious academic subject, but in its present form is probably not that bad and helps people wanting to learn about kitchen cabinets. And I've run into exceptions in which avoiding primary information (e.g. census data, facts from a website, quotes made by the subject of a biography article) might actually distort the article, in that basic facts are needed to make the whole article gel. I did not work on the [[Noam Chomsky#References|Noam Chomsky]] article, but about half of the references are to Chomsky's own writings possibly, and removing them would cripple the article. What I'm saying is this is a complex issue, although I agree with your interpretation of the NOR policy in the instance of the terrorism prevention article.--
[Tomwsulcer]: I'm wondering if I could or should ever subscribe to the academic database [[JStor]] -- it would be great if Wikimedia could subscribe to it and make it available to contributors at reduced rates possibly. Thanks again. You have enlightened me. On purely academic subjects, I'll apply your standard. If I get into disputes about this elsewhere, I may ''reference'' your page here. :)--
[Tomwsulcer]: Yes, agree, thanks, but I see the logic -- let the world thrash out whether something is ''good enough'' and if its notable, ''then'' we'll write about it. Good policy. Makes sense to me. I've come to appreciate that my POVish material like my essays are things to release into the world, and they will sink or swim on their own merits, and I must let go and watch from the beach.--
[Tomwsulcer]: Interesting link. Thanks. I added it to my user page.--
[Tomwsulcer]: Yes the distinction is reasonably clear but it's still a tough one I think to grasp. One might argue that there is an element of originality and research to every article in Wikipedia, perhaps along these lines. Suppose, for sake of argument, that a Wikipedia article doesn't exist on subject X. Academics have published research about it. So, you and I ''research the research'' and we summarize our findings (following WP's rules etc, no synthesis, notability, verifiability etc) and float a Wikipedia article about subject X. In one sense, our Wikipedia article is ''new''. It didn't exist before on the web in its Wikipedia form. There is an element of ''originality'' to this project even though, of course, it is ''old knowledge'' in a ''new context''. One might argue that every Wikipedia article has some kind of synthesis going on simply for the reason that it is easier to get to now since it's in Wikipedia&ndash;&ndash;a synthesis of differing references and sources. And the article existing in Wikipedia says, in effect, that this subject is ''notable'' (is this ''our'' (ie Wikipedia's) ''original'' conclusion?). But this is merely speculative argument. But, overall, I see the issue like you do, and agree with your view, and understand policies such as [[WP:Synthesis|synthesis]] and such; I'm merely saying that in terms of the philosophy of knowledge, alternative viewpoints are possible.--
[Tomwsulcer]: Oh, and btw, I think you articulated the policy idea better than Wikipedia's policy pages in your explanation to me, above, by bolding the word '''research''' within the term original research. It took me a bit to grasp what you were getting at.--

GetAgrippa,False,"[GetAgrippa]: We have missed you at the evolution article. I enjoyed our conversations. I think you have been a tremendous asset to the article and I miss your bright mind and retorts. There is a big move to change the evolution intro with little resistance. Roland is studying for exams. All the experts have voiced their opinions in the past so I figure it is fair to let the novices have a go. I have voiced little resistance so far, but I think you may find some of the changes awkward or not any better than the original. If you have time give it a look see!! Hope all is well.
[GetAgrippa]: Glad to know all is well. You have been missed. Good things take time. I dragged my Ph.D. out six years, because I was having so much fun. Well till I formed my dissertation committee.
[GetAgrippa]: Amen brother. The more you read the more absolutely ignorant you feel. Personally, I like that because it is never boring and always humbling. I noted your research interest-excellent and it has application. I will be absent for a couple of weeks but I will try to add some comments on the peer review if it is warranted. Thanks for the notice.
[GetAgrippa]: Still the busy man. Where do you find the time? So many diverse topics you are entertaining. Kudos for all your excellent work and ethic. Well a quick read and a posit leaves me wondering what is going on over at the neoDarwinism article? Perhaps you could offer some insights as I don't think I understand the insistence of a separate article by Meme. Thanks for the good faith and request for participation. I don't understand why it wouldn't be more prudent to address problems in each article rather than create a separate article? I had hoped the epigenetics article would address a similar semantics conflict and hint that the stub needs further development to be an independent article.  What is your take of it? Thanks
[GetAgrippa]: Well that was interesting!!!!I tried to be diplomatic and display good faith, but some of what Meme was saying just kept making my little bug antennae go twitch,twitch. Some of his comments evoked my knee jerk response: Is he egomaniacal or delusional? I wish I could think of a more polite way to say that. I think you handled it appropriately. Regards
[GetAgrippa]: I would hope that Meme will learn from the experience and maintain one account so editors can Get A better Grip of his contributions (no pun intended hee,hee). We do share similar thoughts on some subjects so I have no direspect for him, but his demeanor at times worked against him.
[GetAgrippa]: I will stay out of Meme's situation, because I know too little of what is going on (nor would I want to influence anyone one way or the other). I respect you and OrangeMarlin so I am at a loss of what to make of it. I tend to think he is a conscientious editor and the engineering contributions are stellar. His psychological perspective is reasonable, but his biological perspective leaves me wanting. He has been courteous and offers cogent arguments (I like that). This is just the kind of situation I feared the creationist paranoia would eventually precipitate. I see no insidious plot to deceive and I think he just inadvertantly stepped in it. I think your correct to employ outside editors to sort it all out. My hopes is that an amicable solution will resolve the issues, and I will get to discover more about the gent. Thanks for your efforts to treat him fairly.
[GetAgrippa]: Your a good man Tim!!! Thanks for all you do in the MCB project. I would rather chew my arm off than be an administrator. Tough job. I note on your CV that it looks like your finishing your second postdoc. Are you planning to do another or are you job hunting? I remember, during my Masters, one of my professors was a parasitologist and he had a keen interest in trypanosomes. Parasitology was an interesting but disgusting course. Regards
[GetAgrippa]: I need to pay a penance also,because I was going out of my way to sympathize and empathize with the editor only to now read all the posits he was pursuing. I look like a freakin idiot! Why is this article not a sentence in the HIV article,if that?
[GetAgrippa]: This Duesberg article really annoys me!! I have argued to have it condensed into a paragraph or sentence for the HIV or another AIDs related article. Duesberg has published about 14 papers or so on the subject and this article status seems to fall under undue Weight (given the huge body of work to the contrary). Duesberg does have a significant body of work related to his aneuploidy and chromosome anomaly cancer hypothesis,yet the Cancer article doesn't even mention the hypothesis. I am all for NPOV and being complete but this seems like overkill. Why not argue including Intelligent Design as an alternate hypothesis in the Evolution article-GRrrrrrrr. The analogy seems appropriate (Ahhhhhhhhh). Where am I wrong in my thinking?
[GetAgrippa]: Thanks for working on Smooth Muscle. As you may note I've expanded the article from the orginal stub, but haven't added references. Parts maybe too technical for an encyclopedic article or too long. I did start adding references to the Talk page, but I have a lot more to add. I would like to reorganize and expand the whole article, and I made a few notes on the Talk page in that regard. Anything you can do to improve the article would be great. Regards

Wikidemo,True,"[Wikidemo]: I am also following the issue.  Though not involved in the initial issue I helped organize the medcabal case and am trying to see it through dispute resolution.  Is there any way to lock the [[TechCrunch#Criticism]] section so it will not be further vandalized?
[Wikidemo]: You mentioned in your edit summary that there this editor commited abuse so egregious it had to be oversighted.  I can find no statements to that effect on AN\/I.  The ArbCom's announcement cited privacy concerns as a reason for not releasing evidence, not severity of abuse.  Have you seen the evidence?  Is there anything you can point me to?  When I asked the committee they said there was no point in excising Melsaran's proposals because his reason for being blocked had nothing to do with the ArbCom case.  I have no problem with the idea that his ''opinions'' should be discounted in that he's not a legitimate user at this point.  ArbCom knows this, but it doesn't hurt to mention it for everyone else.  But I think it may be a distraction to say that the issue was abuse, particularly if we're not really sure.  Cheers,
[Wikidemo]: I don't see anything in those two links to suggest that the account's edits were \""abusive.\""  Abusive suggests disruption, acts like severe trolling or insulting people.  There is some speculation, but in fact no discussion of what the account actually did.  The issue seems to be sockpuppeting, and the reason cited for not releasing the details is supposedly privacy and possibly lack of absolute certainty over identity.
[Wikidemo]: I have reviewed this editor's trivia deletions going back to December 1, 2007 and reverted the deletions (but kept the useful edits) as I considered appropriate - the issues is further discussed at [[Wikipedia talk:Trivia sections]].
[Wikidemo]: You are at 3RR, and edit warring, re. your attempt to censor [[Talk:Ted Frank]].  This is not a BLP issue, and your contentious editing on the subject will quite possibly get you blocked.  If you truly think this is an issue you should take it to [[WP:BLP\/N]] rather than edit warring over your attempt to remove comments from a talk page.
[Wikidemo]: Your tone is quite uncivil and you just made a personal attack on my talk page about that in the process of violating 3RR over trying to censor an old discussion.  I obviously know a lot more about Wikipedia policy than you, and your attempt to redact Wikipedia's discussion history ended up associating Ted Frank with the term \""far right\"" six or eight times where it had been a simple mention.
[Wikidemo]: It's an intellectual mistake, perhaps.  Ted Frank is to the right of most Americans but perhaps not enough to be called \""far\"", and such labels are one-dimensional anyway and not very useful.  However, everyone is entitled to their opinions on the talk page.  #5 does not apply the same way to talk pages that it does to article pages, among other things because information on talk pages is not sourced.  If contentious information about living people were inappropriate for talk pages you could never have, say, a notability discussion.  #6 clearly does not apply to talk pages at all.  You're making a very simple logical fallacy, by the way.  Just because the term \""far right\"" is applied to a number of unsavory individuals does not mean that the term itself is an unsavory one.  \""Far right\"" has a simple, common meaning that someone is among the perhaps 10-15 percent most conservative people.  It doesn't imply racism or anything else derogatory anymore than calling someone \""liberal\"" or \""extreme liberal\"" or \""far left\"" implies that they hate America and want to see us lose wars.  When you look at the purpose of BLP it's to prevent harm and avoid libel.  Ted Frank has a lot of invectives thrown at him and is used to being called far worse than \""far right\"", so I don't think we're going to hurt his feelings much less his reputation with a stray old comment on the talk page.  It's certainly nothing libelous.  I think the proper response would be to add a comment of your own saying what you say here, that the term is unfair and people shouldn't throw it around casually.  That way, anyone reading the talk page (which is mostly editors, few members of the non-Wiki public) will see that some random reader made a hasty comment and the community corrected him\/her.  If you get into deleting and edit warring, you actually cause more of a fuss, and people will simply see an edit war.  If it were a truly bad violation, like calling someone a pedophile, criminal, etc., someone would actually have to delete the edit history so the term doesn't appear anywhere at all.  Incidentally, calling your edits \""weird\"" was perhaps too harsh but they seemed very unusual for a talk page; I accept that you meant no incivility, but you did say that I was supporting an edit that accused Ted Frank of being a Jew hater, etc.  As you can see from my comments I don't believe the term means that at all.
[Wikidemo]: Yes, please - if you could.  A couple editors, including a new IP editor who we strongly suspect is a sock of a banned user, are filling the Obama talk page with argumentation.  I can't promise that our responses have always been the most diplomatic, but it is hard.  I am going to caution one or both of them to stop because I do not know what else to do, but they have turned this around to make this an issue about me, so my ability to make peace here is quite limited.  I appreciate all your efforts to date; if this is too much for you maybe we should appeal for some additional help as well.  Thanks,
[Wikidemo]: Is clever :)  I did think people were referring to Jimbo for a bit....  I hope you enjoy editing here as much as the name indicates.  Cheers,
[Wikidemo]: Thanks for fixing my comment format on an\/i.  I really shouldn't be adding to long threads from a smartphone. Now that I see where the discussion is going though I think it was too far off topic and a bit too accusitory but my device won't let me edit a section that long.  If I may ask another favor would you mind deleting or striking it at my request? I think the discussion is best limited to the specific topic. Thanks. -"
Woonpton,False,"[Woonpton]: Yes, we're obviously not communicating, and the non-apology (See WP:APOLOGY for definition) you left on my talk page and the message you posted on Raul's page, further escalating the misunderstanding, certainly haven't improved the situation.  Funny thing, I was thinking all morning about how to find a way to understand each other,  and was considering a conciliatory post on Raul's page to try to get back to a place where we can discuss the issues, but after reading what you wrote today, I'm in no mood for it.   I don't understand how it is that my answers to your questions p###ed you off so much; I thought the questions were asked in good faith and my answers were in good faith.  I think civility, while important in some sense, is a red herring when it comes to fixing what's wrong with the project, as the real problems are NPOV and RS, and incivility can't be treated in isolation.  I don't understand why that opinion would make you so angry.  I'm very serious about not sticking around without some assurance that NPOV and RS will be enforced by the community; I don't understand why in our conversations you keep hammering on that same nail (incivility isn't helpful) since incivility isn't an issue I have  ( I'm not incivil with the editors I work with on articles, and the articles I'm interested in working on are not beset by incivility, only by intransigent refusal to follow the core policies of the encyclopedia in the service of fringe ideas).  I would like some help with that, some assurance that if I did take on those articles (in a civil and professional manner, which is the only way I would do it) that someone would back me up on NPOV and RS.  But when I raise these concerns, all you can offer is to keep saying over and over that incivility isn't helpful.  Well, yes, I know that, I agree with that.  But, how to proceed, is the question.   But at this point, you're the last person I would turn to for help in that effort. I will say that I'm very sorry to have angered you, but still don't really understand your anger.   You did ask the questions, after all.  I can only guess it's a matter of personal styles; you just don't like my communication style, don't understand it. That would be too bad, but probably not fixable.
[Woonpton]: We obviously have very different ideas about what would make Wikipedia a tolerable working environment and a successful encyclopedia, but since I'm leaving the field, I doubt there's any useful purpose in our continuing to debate the question.  The one last thing I intend to do is to write an \""exit essay\"" for the folks at the \""expert withdrawal\"" page.  I admire their tenacity, stamina and commitment to the project; I sympathize with their situation, but have no taste for fighting windmills, and so won't be joining in their effort to try to slow the inexorable and ongoing downward spiral of Wikipedia into nonsense and misinformation.  I won't say my brief venture into the wikipedia has been fun or enjoyable, but it's been most enlightening.
[Woonpton]: '''''There was, of course, discussion of the case on the mailing list \u2014 though nowhere to the extent that some people imagine \u2014 but they were not substantive points but points of process; things like coordination of who was to write new proposals, suggested rewordings, exhortations to vote and get the effing case done. But, unlike what some people imagine, the actual nature of the decision gets very little attention on the list: you'll see the vast majority of that discussion and give-and-take on the decision page proper.''''' (Coren) This is the most alarming thing I've seen in all the vast verbiage I've seen devoted to the case. I, like most rational people I expect, assumed that long delays during the proposed decision process, and the lack of workshopping and transparency in the discussion of the proposed decision, meant that, for whatever reason, the committee had decided to conduct their deliberations on the case behind closed doors.  If this (bolded statement) is true and there  were no substantive discussions on the decision behind closed doors, if in fact the only deliberations were the few brief exchanges that were visible on the proposed decision page, then I don't know what to say.  I wouldn't go so far as WMC has done in questioning the veracity of Coren's assertion, I'll only say that to believe that the statement is not true is less damaging to ArbCom's credibility than believing that it's true, because believing that it's true means accepting that there were actually no deliberations of substance, which is not acceptable.
[Woonpton]: re Shell: She has been hounded relentlessly by a couple of guys with a terminal case of IDIDNTHEARTHAT, who still won't let it go even after being told repeatedly to stop; to take one remark out of context out of that whole tendentious discussion to make a point of your own seems to me a cheap shot.
[Woonpton]: Mistakes? That reminds me of the famous saying \""mistakes were made\"" excusing a major coverup on the part of high-level US administration.  At any rate, I don't know where you're seeing \""wolves\"" ripping Rlevse to shreds; it must be on some page I'm not watching.  All I'm seeing is people making excuses for him and defending him and leaving tearful messages on his talk page.  You're right, this isn't the place to debate copyright, but copyright really isn't that difficult.  Every now and then, IRL,  I run across copies of things I've written (here I'm talking about general-purpose writing, not scientific or statistical writing)  taken and used in places where I never gave permission for it to be used, by people who never asked my permission to copy the text.  People think that as long as they attribute the text to the writer, they have satisfied the requirements of copyright.  No, ''you can't copy copyrighted work without the permission of the copyright owner''; that's what copyright means.
[Woonpton]: If you really think the question at the bureaucrats noticeboard (which seems a very reasonable question to me; if Rlevse comes back is he to be considered as having left under a cloud or not?) is an example of \""wolves tearing Rlevse to shreds\"" then we apparently aren't speaking the same language, which makes it difficult to have a reasonable conversation.  As for the questions about DYK, they seem very legitimate questions to me, and the information that has come to light about the DYK process during that discussion doesn't reflect well on the encyclopedia IMO.  But it looks like we're not going to agree about that either, nor on whether raising questions about problems in the DYK process constitutes ripping Rlevse to shreds, nor apparently, by extension, on whether he should have kept his arb seat after the violations were discovered. So let's just agree to disagree and call it a day.
[Woonpton]: Okay, I'll concede the point."

[Oleg Alexandrov]: Thanks. As you will certainly notice, there are some good Wikipedians who don't bother to put an edit summary, even if it is required (and helpful). So, ultimately you will develop your own style too (and I hope it will be the right one :)
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Most people did not reply because I think nobody cares :) So the best thing to do is, as you plan, to just go ahead with it.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: PS The table looks good.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: or, otherwise, just type \""refine category\"" (if you use a browser like Mozilla, it will remember what you typed, and next time you don't need to type it again). Thanks, and enjoy!
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Let me back off a bit. For minor edits, an edit summary could probably be skipped. (It is nice to have it even then, though :)
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Welcome back! Hope you had a good time, and are now ready to plounge back in the virtual world. :)
[Oleg Alexandrov]: --><p>When you leave the edit summary blank, some of your edits could be mistaken for [[WP:-(|vandalism]] and may be [[WP:RV|reverted]], so please always briefly summarize your edits, especially when you are making subtle but important changes, like changing dates or numbers.

[Oleg Alexandrov]: And thank you for your great work in classifying stubs.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Paul, I was thinking of the same thing these days. Looking forward to a positive answer. :)

[Oleg Alexandrov]: Hi Paul. I noticed that you are considering making a list of categories of mathematicians. So I thought I would give you the list I have. It is a couple of months old, and it might not be of use to you, but it might avoid some duplicate work if you plan to do anything about that. See [[User:Oleg_Alexandrov\/Test_page]]. Cheers,
[Oleg Alexandrov]: That is, and now seriously, would you like to be an admin? I think you will make a great admin (I wish I had your cool head when it comes to dealing with other editors :) I think from the mathematicians's side there will be good support. So just let me know.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: So, I wonder if you would agree with me that the thing needs to be moved back, and if yes, if you could do the move (since you have the admin powers). Thanks.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Hi Paul. Thanks. I wrote something on [[Talk:gradient]] and made a [[gradient (disambiguation)]] page listing the two meanings. Would you mind putting [[gradient]] on your watchlist, in case there is further discussion on the subject? Thanks a lot.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: I think the wording is kind of tough, but I agree with [[User:R.Koot|R.Koot]]'s statement. Big changes of this kind be better discussed first at [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Mathematics]].
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Ik ben het ermee eens dat is de aangewezen oplossing opnieuw richt. Waarom dragen de mensen bij Duch tot Engelse Wikipedia? Babelfish kon niet dit beantwoorden.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: It's my fault. I starting methodically listing all mathematicians in the [[List of mathematicians]] (read: mathbot does the work). I barely finished with the Duch and American mathematicians, and you already complain. :) A lot more are to come.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Check out [[User:mathbot\/Changes mathlist]] for a version without mathematicians.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Of course Jitse's code can't do that! Mine can do all that though, and much, much more!
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Also, I wonder if you saw my question at [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Mathematics\/Current activity]] about adding a section containing several random articles. But now if I think of it, it might be not a good idea, as you already have lots of sections in the current activity. Cheers,
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Congrats from me too. How about writing a bot to automatically delete articles listed on VfD? (Er, that seems to be the dark force Paul is mentioning.)
[Oleg Alexandrov]: (And no, protecting [[List of mathematical topics (A-C)]] and its cousins from my abusive bot is not the answer.)
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Hi Paul. Your edit to this article removed two paragraphs for some reason. Must be some Wikipedia quirck again, but I thought you would like to know about it. I fixed it.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Thanks. I knew about purge, but it did not do the trick. I see now, one also had to visit the page again. I will give it a try later today. The Cruise business is answered on my talk page.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Third, to continue our converstation started a bit [[User talk:Jitse Niesen#List of mathematical topics (A-C)|above]], that purge thing followed by downloading a copy of the page, does not seem to work at refreshing the \""what links\"" feature. So I wonder if you would be willing to use the pywikipedia framework to produce empty edits to that list. Otherwise, if you think you won't get to this in a while, I will go back to my silly daily edits to that page to refresh the links. Wonder what you think. Thanks.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Yes, I am looking forward to banning somebody, just for practice. You know, there is a first in everything. And why not you be the first person I will block? But Paul, do you really want me to do that to you? I mean are you really sure? If I block you, and then you realize you don't really want to be blocked, if you are starting having a withdrawal from not being able to edit, how will you Paul notify me that you want to be unblocked, as you will be blocked and won't be able to edit?!? So think about it Paul. Its like jumping from the bridge, you know. You are half-way through and then you want to live, but its too late! Think about it.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: OK, I was not clear enough. Empty edits work if one opens a browser window, edits an article, and clicks \""save page\"" without actually editing anything. That causes the \""what links here\"" to be refreshed with no mention in the history, and not showing up on the watchlist. And yes, empty edits with my bot fail to do that, 'cause the mediawiki perl package I am using refuses to submit empty edits. And that's where the whole point is. I hoped that the pywikipedia framework will allow one to do true empty edits exactly as if one opens the browser window, and so refreshing \""what links here\"" without showing up on the watchlist. If you think it does not allow empty edits that way, I will pollute your watchlist again. :)
[Oleg Alexandrov]: OK, OK, I will ban you if you insist. But don't be selfish, and indeed finish with the PM project first. Of the 4000 articles there, at least three thousand need reviewing I guess. Talk to you again in a couple of years.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: I had it all messed up. The \""what links here\"" feature is sort of the dual (in some unspecified space) of the \""recent changes\"". And of course the latter is what we care about.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: First, the \""best wikipedia editor\"", then the \""august Paul\"". Gosh, ain't you blushing under that hat?
[Oleg Alexandrov]: What the heck is the eigenspace of non-linear operator? Still Tv = &lambda;v? You can of course generalize things till you get tired, but I doubt that this concept is actually used or useful in math. References please?
[Oleg Alexandrov]: I ''do plan'' to disover this anon's identity, use it, make huge credit card debt in Vegas strip bars, and as a final touch, publish it on the web under the [[GFDL]].
[Oleg Alexandrov]: I went ahead and wrote a comment on user's talk page. First time offenders need to be treated lightly. If the user keeps on doing that even after warned, one may meantion the stick (meaning the possibity of being blocked). That's how I would see it. Let us see how things develop.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: You may be interested in [[Wikipedia:Administrators%27 noticeboard\/Incidents#Ed_Poor blocked Duncharris again]].
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Hi Paul. [[User:Mathbot|Mathbot]] is saying \""hi\"". He got over that \""bag of bits\"" description, and is wondering why your newest talk page archive is not on your watchlist. Does it have anything to do with, uhm, you doing it under compulsion?
[Oleg Alexandrov]: You  check your archive, bot said.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Note however, that when it shows up as a thumb, the text is too tiny and lines too thin. I would suggest making the circle bigger, the font larger, the lines thicker, and the arrows bigger too. Wonder what you think.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Looks better, thanks!
[Oleg Alexandrov]: I don't know any policy about it, but I don't think deleting R.Koot's page was a good idea. Rudy, you should have just put a note that you are away, that's it. I hope it was not CSTAR who inspired you (he's a great user and admin, but that jesture was foolish). Anyway, everybody needs a break from time to time. I just hope you will be back.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: I like this one more too.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: You forgot not only Latin, Paul, but also how to sign your name. Now go stand in the corner facing the wall for 15 minutes reciting [[Hail Mary|Ave Maria]] 20 times for [[penance]].
[Oleg Alexandrov]: I replied on my talk page.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Make one then. :) Come on Fropuff, it is really easy. There is Xfig on Linux (on Windows they have winfig). Any vector drawing package would work just fine too, like inkscape. All you need to draw is several lines and maybe circle arcs. Easy. Matlab or maple would work too, if you know how to use them (otherwise I can help you with matlab) Easy.  :)
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Yes, I used inkscape too. Very nice and easy to use, free as in beer, and easy to install. I really love the way it draws splines. You can draw a shape, then it is very easy to fine-tune it. And it does export to eps as far as I know.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: About your remark that you would like a image editor which also plays very well with LaTeX, well, that's too much to ask. But there is hope. :) Usually people generate eps figures with very simple text labels, and then manipulate those from within the LaTeX document (so from the TeX article you are writing you can control everything about the text in the eps figures it includes, like what formulas to have, what font, what size, etc.) The package with helps with that is called psfrag. See [http:\/\/www.math.umn.edu\/~aoleg\/latex_tips\/latex_tips.shtml here, towards the middle of the page]. There is a learning curve, but no harder than learning one more LaTeX command. Cheers,
[Oleg Alexandrov]: If you don't want to use 14 separate programs, and if you don't want to use that bloated inkscape, you can just use LaTeX's drawing facilities (draw points, draw lines, draw curves). Doable, but that's the real pain in the ass. :)
[Oleg Alexandrov]: I wrote something there. I hope the anon will be well-meaning to listen. Otherwise, probably one should ignore whatever that person says on the talk page and revert any incorrect changes to the article if that person may attept to write there.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: The easiest way of checking this is to plug the Crank-Nicholson scheme into mathematica, subtract from it the exact derivatives (heat equation that is), and expand all in Taylor series (mathematica has a command for that). One can also do Maple too I think. Symbolic calculations saved my ass a lot of times when dealing with messy finite-difference schemes.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: So, one late evening, Los Angeles time, I will do the moves and patch my scripts, with you having to do the same by next evening (UK time) when your own scripts run (besides the current activity, there is also the one which touches [[List of mathematical topics (A-C)]]). Would it work for you if I do the move on December 22 (tomorrow night), and you  fixing your scripts on December 23? Any other day is fine, as long as we agree on when. Cheers,
[Oleg Alexandrov]: That's done. --
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Hi Jitse. One remark. Your bot updating the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Mathematics\/Current activity]] page does not count the new items my bot has been adding to [[Wikipedia:Pages needing attention\/Mathematics]]. I understand why you don't like me, but why doesn't your bot like my bot? :)
[Oleg Alexandrov]: That answer of yours is just like a python, long, thin, and useless. I guess after your script swallowed the recent prey (a lot of math articles needing attention), it is going to digest it for a couple of weeks in hybernation mode, so either ssh-ing it or even kicking it with the boot is not going to give you anything. Do you have the code of the script lying around? Then I could run it from my own linux machine.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: PS: That was firmly with the tail in cheek.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Got your mail. If your script does not wake up in a couple of days I will take measures (skinning the thing is an option).
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Great! I tried to run your code, and installed the pywikipedia library, but it still complained about some missing XML libraries, so I gave up. By the way, you still did not answer the question of why your bot does not show 200 articles needing attention, but only 30. Are you trying to convince yourself into thinking that the articles needing attention are really just two dozen? :)
[Oleg Alexandrov]: If I am allowed to squeak in, maybe there should be some discussion at [[talk:Julius Caesar]] where the editors would express their opinions on the matter, with the dates staying for the time as they were before this started, that is, BC\/AD. No?
[Oleg Alexandrov]: I would second Aranda56's comments. Your adminship request is not likely to pass at this time. It is good if you spend more time around here.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Takes a while to get used to the project. As far as your requests for adminship, I am glad you are willing to help, but as you know (from your background) promoting somebody to general from the first day may not have good consequences for the troops later. :) That time will come. :) Enjoy!

[Oleg Alexandrov]: Hi Fropuff. I updated the redlinks pages (actually, it is doing it now). This time I wrote a real, useable script instead of a hack, so the process is fully automated. I can restart it at anytime with no work. Bug me again when you want those links refreshed (maybe a couple of weeks could be a good interval, I don't know).
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Nah, the list is not mine, is the [[list of mathematics articles]]. :)
[Oleg Alexandrov]: There are indeed 12151 math articles, but around 700 of them are redirects (that problem needs to be dealt with eventually). To answer your last question, articles come in either by hand, or lately, via [[User:mathbot]] (see first section). They come out via [[User:mathbot\/Blacklist]].
[Oleg Alexandrov]: OK, my bot does not add redirects, but it does not remove existing redirects either. The more time goes by, the more I think that all the redirects from the [[list of mathematics articles]] must go. There is no good reason to keep them in.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Congrats!
[Oleg Alexandrov]: I don't quite see from the several recent posts at [[User talk:Anittas]] that the block taught him anything. Ronline, I replied on my talk page about the RfArb. I would support one if you are willing to go for it.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: See also Charles Stewart's comment on my talk page.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Hai ma Ronline, [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&curid=1261677&diff=36028328&oldid=36026063 chiar asa]? Bonaparte a vorbit frumos cand ti-a scris cateva email-uri, si asta e un motiv suficient sa fie deblocat? Postul tau evident nu va fi luat in serios. Si sper ca inca nu ai uitat ca el vota cu mai multe conturi pentru administraor, care din punctul meu de vedere inseamna ca Bonaparte nu are nici o onoare. Si sa stii ca cineva care a cazut asa departe nu este usor de reeducat.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: And don't you follow [[WP:AN\/I]]? Bonaparte is world-famous. Basically all administrators on Wikipedia know him. And cheating by voting with multiple accounts, that's much worse than anything Anittas ever did. That's a shame to us, Romanians. This kind of people must go.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: If Ronline is Tom, then you are the little boy from the movie who begs to be spanked. As we all know, spanking he got. :)
[Oleg Alexandrov]: I would also be interested why the person 192.94.94.106 contributing from ti.com (Texas Instruments I guess) can't make an account. You get more anonymity with an account, not less, if that's the concern. Just pick a silly name, and will make life easier for you, and most importantly, for everybody else. :)
[Oleg Alexandrov]: [http:\/\/mywebpages.comcast.net\/thebibleway\/P-Candle.htm] Hi Jitse. Awesome work with [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Mathematics\/Current activity\/Lists]]! I have just one remark. Not many people know about that page, and where it is now is not the most likely place people would look for it. Since your  page contains very important information, about math pages needing cleanup, and it should be as visible as possible. Maybe an idea would be to translude it at [[Wikipedia:Pages needing attention\/Mathematics]], replacing my half-cooked attempt at getting information from templates? Wonder what you think.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: About the beer, I never heard of Grlolsch. I believe it is most likely [[Heineken]], which I do drink every now and then.  Retrospectively, I should have had the label of the beer bottle face the camera, but I guess I was preoccupied with other things at the moment.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: No pressure :) And I would be more than happy to try Grolsch, if I ever see it in stores, and don't forget its name by then. But no, I won't forget, it looks just like a clone of Heineken with a strange name. :)
[Oleg Alexandrov]: It is surely late in there. :) No, I won't transclude, I believe you got the thing with the bushel to close to your heart. :) I will let you make up your own mind about what is best. In case you do decide to transclude, one may need to change the heading level and maybe other things to make it look good in [[Wikipedia:Pages needing attention\/Mathematics]]. Yeah, I am aware that [[Wikipedia:Pages needing attention\/Mathematics]] transcludes in turn in [[Wikipedia:Pages needing attention\/Mathematical and Natural Sciences]]. So I would even go as far as suggest that you edit [[Wikipedia:Pages needing attention\/Mathematics]] directly, without transclusion, but I knew you wouldn't like the idea so I didn't ask. :)
[Oleg Alexandrov]: No, let us not avoid the issue of the account. You show up sporadically, each time with a different IP address, and don't even know how to sign your posts. You should make an account, and be a well-behaved Wikipedia citizen. Then it will be easier for us to talk to you, and your comments would get more weight as well.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Hi Loom91. Just some tips, based on [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Manifold&curid=2073470&diff=38594499&oldid=38538709 this edit] of yours. The link <nowiki>[[Sets]]<\/nowiki> should be instead <nowiki>[[set]]s<\/nowiki>, and the link <nowiki>[[Functions]]<\/nowiki> should be <nowiki>[[function (mathematics)|functions]]<\/nowiki>. That is to say, links should be lowercase, and for the function link, it should not point to [[function]], rather, to [[function (mathematics)]]. Thanks.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Note that [[User:WAREL]]'s editing style and articles of interest seem to be an aweful lot like [[User:DYLAN LENNON]]'s, and I think we are having a sockpuppet here. Not that it matters now, but it may be good to keep in mind.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: They came from the [[list of mathematicians]]. An overzealous person put them in, and for many of them even the dates of birth are unknown. I would suggest removing any redlinks from the [[list of mathematicians]], but this may need a wider discussion at our wikiproject.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Hi Splash. Thanks a lot, that's exactly what I wanted. Sorry for the extra work I had you do; from now on I will keep all my templates in userspace. :)
[Oleg Alexandrov]: The bot will not bug you ever again. I keep a list of people the bot wrote to. Cheers,
[Oleg Alexandrov]: To see which article you put summary or you did not, you can look up at the top of the browser window, and click on \""Contributions\"". Cheers,
[Oleg Alexandrov]: So far I have 40 replies, and out of them one complaint. I do not agree my bot's message was judgemental, at least the examples you point out do not apply. If you would like to change the message, you can do so [[User:Mathbot\/Sample edit summary request|here]]. I will stop my bot for now, but that's a pity, as it is greatly helpful, while I think the disruption is minimal, if at all existant.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: I guess you read only the last message at [[User talk:Mathbot\/Feedback on the summary bot]], and not the 39 preceeding it. Give it a try. :)
[Oleg Alexandrov]: But no, I won't run the bot anymore. Even if the bot is very useful, such complaints are bound to show up, and to be honest, you gave me an unhapy afternoon, and I could spend time doing things which are both useful and fun, rather than just useful. :) Cheers,

[Oleg Alexandrov]: John, with due respect, you are being unnecessarily harsh in your comments. As you said, each of us have their own views on how the article should be called. The matter is being discussed, and I suggest you wait a bit, and don't take things as close to heart. As far as \""fixing\"" those pages to point to whatever article name is decided, it can be easily done with a bot, so please don't stress so much on that in your arguments.

[Oleg Alexandrov]: Yes I agree too. Just be around for a while longer, say 3 months, do good work, and give it a try again. :)
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Hi Jitse. I was [[User_talk:Oleg_Alexandrov#Mathbot_2|asked]] to help with [[Wikipedia:Bot_requests#Archiving_Wikipedia:Articles_for_Creation |this request]], but my bot can't handle it. Would your bot be up to the task, and would you have time\/be willing to look into that? Wonder what you think. Thanks.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: I did not forget your request a while ago about the script listing entries in the list which are not in the categories, and also plan to rewrite that script to not spit out garbage in times of trouble. I'll get to this in a while. Cheers,

[Oleg Alexandrov]: Heh. :) I had been involved there for a while, at Charles request, but nobody would listen, so I eventually chickened out. Page protection did not work, blocks appear not to work either, the RfArb against ZAROVE helped a bit, but it appears the conflict is still going on. Good luck, Jitse. :)
[Oleg Alexandrov]: I guess it is half a year after you requested that feature. Part of the delay was that I got involved in other things (scripting for [[WP:MST]] took unbelivable more time than one may think, primarily because of developing some heuristics and tricks to deal with incomplete and upper case Mathworld entries &mdash; [[ Great Stellated Trunca...]] anybody?). Another reason is that I am still learning to write clean code, and adding new features to awufully written scripts is not for the faint of the heart. But either way, request completed! :)

[Oleg Alexandrov]: Hi Jitse. I plan to split this list into [[list of mathematicians (A)]], etc., per [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Mathematics#Split of List of mathematicians]] with the [[List of mathematicians]] just containing links to those subpages. A prerequisite for that would be to have your bot read [[list of mathematicians (A)]], etc., ''in addition'' to the  [[List of mathematicians]] when updating the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Mathematics\/Current activity]]. I wonder if you could look into that when you have time. Thanks.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: All these are just some thoughts. You surely thought much more than me on how things should be, so I wonder what your opinons on the above are. Thanks.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: You are abusing your tools. I suggest you go offline for a while and calm down. You are a good guy but you have a tendency to play on borderline of acceptable behaviour. Don't do that.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Replied on my talk.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Hi Jitse. I wonder if you take a look at the [[finite difference schemes]] article (I renamed it to current name and edited it a bit, but the article has been around for a while). I have some comments on its [[talk:finite difference schemes|talk page]]. Thanks.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Hi Giftlite. I noticed you were adding in links a while ago, and now you are removing many links. I know why, there should be no more than one link per concept per article, but really, is it worth the trouble? :) One can easily write a bot to remove extra links, but I would think they better left the way they are, there are other things one could spend time on improving. Wonder what you think. You can reply here. Thanks.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Wow, you are of much better opinion of Wikipedia articles than I am. :) By the way, if you want to work on things, see [[Wikipedia:Pages needing attention\/Mathematics]]. :) Cheers,
[Oleg Alexandrov]: If the current trend continues, I would also consider bailing out. So far I am left with the hope that these are just a few irregularities in an otherwise rather well-behaving community (and I think  that irregularities have happened in the past too, and the ArbCom\/Jimobo have taken pretty good care of the worst ones). (I hope I am right :) Good luck. Hope you come back.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Please stop indeed. I find that mass posting to be disruptive. Please find some other venue of dealing with this issue.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: I don't quite know what to suggest, but mass-posting is not the way to go, no matter how strongly you feel about the issue. Thanks.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: I nominated it for deletion, at [[Wikipedia:Categories for deletion\/Log\/2006 October_17#Category:Articles with example pidgincode]]. Wonder if you could comment there. Thanks.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Hi. I don't understand [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Derivative&diff=89656897&oldid=89594674 this edit]. Not at all really, and not for lack of mathematics education. Would you please visit [[talk:Derivative]] and explain what you mean? Thanks.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Never mind, I think I got it now.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Welcome, indeed. :)
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Sorry. I have been kind of grumpy and inconsiderate. I don't own the [[derivative]] article, so please feel free to edit it. I won't interfere with your changes anymore.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: I fixed that. The stats will have those links when the bot runs tonight.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Yeah, it is cold in [[Los Angeles, California|LA]] too. It is now early morning, and 6 Celcius. (Quite cool if you have the window open and no socks; the fingers typing on the keyboard are numb too :) But by afternoon we'll have 18 \xb0C and sun all over, so ain't that bad. :)

[Oleg Alexandrov]: Well, all you need to is delete [[:Category:Computer and video game articles by quality]], [[:Category:Computer and video game articles by importance]], [[:Category:Computer and video game articles with comments]], all the pages in that category, and all the subpages in [[Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team\/Computer and video game articles by quality]]. Since you guys wanted the rename so badly, I guess you've go to do all that cleanup. :) I will reply on your talk page too.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: I don't think so. You guys wanted the rename, you've got to delete the old names (all 50-80 or so of them). Sorry. :) Let's keep all conversation at [[Wikipedia talk:Version 1.0 Editorial Team\/Index]], so please reply there if you'd like to comment further.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: The reason Python was invented was so that what would take David 200 lines of code in assembly could be done by Jitse in ''two'' lines of Python code. Right Jitse? Let's show David that his request is no big deal and two lines of code for that is enough even with one of them being a comment.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Heh, a Wikipedia bot written in assembly, that sounds so cool ...
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Hi. Note that [[:Category:Finite Element Method]] should be instead [[:Category:Finite element method]], in lowercase, per Wikipedia style. You can reply here if you have comments. Cheers,
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Thanks. But you actually need to go and edit each article in [[:Category:Finite Element Method]] to make it appear in [[:Category:Finite element method]]. After that I can delete [[:Category:Finite Element Method]].
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Nope, unfortunately. Either you fix it, or somebody else will have to do it. I can write a bot to do this particular renaming, but writing and debugging such a program would take more time than doing it by hand.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Hi Jitse. You are an expert on finite differences, so, if you have time, I wonder what you think of the recent changes to [[Finite difference]] and the comment at [[Talk:Finite difference]]. Thanks.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Hi Jitse. I heard you are an expert in reaction-diffusion equations. Our [[Reaction-diffusion]] kind of sucks. Any chance you may add something to it? :)
[Oleg Alexandrov]: so I thought you may know something about those things. :)
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Thanks! I agree that wikignoming is not that much fun. I did write three articles so far this year, however. Writing articles takes time though. It is much simpler to just check your watchlist and talk smartly on talk pages. :)
[Oleg Alexandrov]: [http:\/\/tools.wikimedia.de\/~interiot\/cgi-bin\/Tool1\/wannabe_kate Wannabie Kate].
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Hi Jitse. You may be interested in the discussion I started at [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Mathematics#Template:Numerical algorithms]]. Thanks.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Thank you for your contributions and pictures to [[Curl]]. I have one suggestion however. It would be great if the pictures you put in were of higher resolution, and preferable in png, which is not blurry and which is better suited for line art. I wonder what you think. You can reply here. Thanks.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: It should be possible to export from mathematica to eps I believe, or even to other formats, like png or gif (maybe from the \""File\"" menu). Could you try and see if it works?
[Oleg Alexandrov]: I see. Perhaps you could post the code at each of the pictures (which is a good idea in general anway), then I can try to fix them tomorrow (I don't have mathematica at home, but have at school).
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Cheers,
[Oleg Alexandrov]: So, as follow up of the above, are you reluctant to part with the dearly written mathematica code? :)
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Loodog, you misunderstood me I think. I am very happy with your pictures. :) All I wanted is to recreate them with higher resolution, for that I would need your original code. If that's fine with you. So I won't replace the pictures, except for the resolution.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Cool. I'll get to this after Memorial Day.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Thank you for the nice work at [[Boundedness]]. And I have a small style note. In math notation the variables should be italic, so ''x'' instead of x, etc. I fixed that in there. Cheers,
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Nothing to be frightened of, nowadays Lethe is just a lazy bum, who edits only to delete the signpost from his talk page. :) Oh, you mean the picture on the user page? :)
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Please do not add TOCleft to article, there's got to be a good reason for that. In most articles the default toc looks best. Thanks. You can reply here.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Your tocleft to [[Northern Mariana Islands]] made the article look rather badly. Again, please don't add TOCleft unless you have very good reasons for that and in very special cases.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: I think you may need to go through [[WP:DRV]].
[Oleg Alexandrov]: package. Cheers,
[Oleg Alexandrov]: I added the axes. The new image is [[:Image:Uniform curl.svg]]. I'd argue that the lines look much sharper, and there are no JPG artifacts. If you could give me the EPS version of the other images I could do the same for them (I can't run the 3D code on my Mathematica installation).
[Oleg Alexandrov]: I am just wondering why you [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Bruin&curid=4888&diff=148593749&oldid=144341524 removed] the picture from the Bruin page. While the page is a disambig, I believe the picture is useful. You can reply here. Thanks.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Also, while the primary meaning of \""bruin\"" is indeed in Wiktionary, stating it at the beginning of the [[Bruin]] article is useful for readers I think. I put that back. Again, you can reply here if you have comments.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Right. But the picture illustrates the primary concept, of a \""baby bear, when said poetically\"". While the page is disambig, focusing a bit on the primary concept is good I think.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: But there is no baby bear picture around. Then the UCLA one could be better than nothing I think. (I act on the belief that pictures are good and lighten up the tone of articles, even if when they are not absolutely necessary).
[Oleg Alexandrov]: OK, you convinced me. It is a nice picture though.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Thanks! That was the right place for it indeed.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Hi Jitse. Thank you for removing [[International Journal of Ecology & Development (IJED)]] from the statistics journals category where it did not belong. And a note. I think you run into this journal via the current activity bot. In that case, since the article was not about statistics (so neither about mathematics), I think it is good if the article is also removed from the [[list of mathematics articles]]. (The bot does not do that automatically.) Thanks for looking after the math articles. Cheers,
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Hi Giftlite. I see you a lot on my watchlist doing fixes and reverting bad edits. That is great. Are you aware of the tool linked from the [[List of mathematics articles]] which allows one to see the combined list of recent changes to all math articles? Could be helpful in the great work you're doing. Thanks. You can reply here.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Cool. :) Thank you for your work.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Hi Fropuff. Long time no see. :) I wonder if you can look at my edit at [[exponential map]]. I hope I got it right, but my understanding of these things is rather shaky. By the way, should it be mentioned that the unit circle example is a particular case of the matrix group example below (since the unit circle is a group of rotations), or that is not necessary? Thanks. You can reply here.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: I started a discussion at [[Talk:Gauss-Newton algorithm]] in response to the rewrite of this article. Since you contributed a good part of the original article and are very familiar with the topic, I wonder if you could comment there. Thanks.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Thank you for the new [[:Image:Graph of sliding derivative line.gif]]. I have two requests. First, would it be possible to post the image source code on the image page, it is in the spirit of Wikipedia and may help other people understand how you made the image. Second, your blue curve is kind of wiggling, which it should not. Could you recreate the image so that it does not do that? Thanks a lot. You can reply here.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: I replied on my talk page.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: I replied on my talk. In short, thank you!
[Oleg Alexandrov]: This actually goes back to mathbot, the machine on which it runs is down, and then nothing feeds Jitse's bot. I notified the system people about the machine, hopefully it will get fixed soon and all will come back to normal.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Regarding [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion\/Old&diff=262448841&oldid=262445493 this], I think you're adding a day too early. I believe five full days should elapse before AfD discussions should be closed. No? To check yourself, no day should appear twice at [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion]], so if a day shows up as a current discussion, it should not show up as an old discussion too. Thanks. You can reply here.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: I don't care much. What you are doing is not strictly following the policy, which says the users have full five days (at least) to discuss a deletion, but I don't see much harm practically in closing the discussions a day or half a day earlier. So let's leave things at this.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: By the way, 1600hrs is midnight according to GMT. I think the bot is doing just the right thing, it marks a page for a given day as old exactly six full days after after that page got started.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: I saw your post on this at [[Talk:List of mathematics articles]]. If you really want a discussion on this, the right page is [[WT:WPM]].
[Oleg Alexandrov]: I guess it was added by a user, not by the bot.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Paul, you may be interested in the following discussion, [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Mathematics#Computational complexity theory as part of \""mathematics\""]]. Thanks.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: No problem. I think there are plenty of opinions already.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: I commented on this user's Dutch wiki talk page.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Thanks! The fix works, so I uploaded it to the project page ([http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/perlwikipedia\/source\/browse\/trunk\/lib\/MediaWiki\/Bot.pm revision 211]). I hope the change can be reviewed by the project owner when he's back.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Nah, that's too much work. :)
[Oleg Alexandrov]: I'll take a look soon.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Thank you for acting as mathbot in the meantime, that was a lot of counting to do. :)
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Thanks. I fixed this.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: I commented there.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: I fixed this (hopefully). This is due to the fact that Wikipedia handles special characters inconsistently. It sometimes encodes \""(\"" to \"".28\"", but in other contexts it fails to recognize this as as an encoding of \""(\"". Please let me know if there other problems. Thank you for monitoring the tool.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Will do soon the \""Carryl Varley\"" bug as well (here article name is not the same as AfD subpage name).
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Fixed that one too. [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion\/Old&oldid=418262041 link]
[Oleg Alexandrov]: I guess you can look at the edit history of [[Template:Citation]] to see who added the fields. To award the barnstar, there is no formal procedure, just paste the text\/picture on their page.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: I think a conflict of interest is something worse than that. :) You have nothing to gain personally from linking from one article partially authored by you on Wikipedia to another article partially authored by you on another web site. And the external article is relevant to the Wikipedia article. So I think everything is OK.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Thanks. I'll reverse the colors one of these days.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Try posting this at [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Statistics]]. That way hopefully we'll have a few opinions about whether the article is notable.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: You are right. I am short of time now, but I'll get to it in a couple of days.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: I reversed the colors ([[:Image:Heat eqn.gif]]). Thanks for the suggestion.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: The bot was confused by the fact that [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\/Log\/2011 April 11]] had a section which was not an AfD, see \""Proposed Compromise involving MLB Rivalry page\"" in there. I refined a bit bot's search pattern to distinguish this from a true AfD. Parsing html is inherently error-prone, hopefully there could be a better solution at some point. Thanks for the bug report.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Surprisingly enough, the image is correct. I measured the distances in Inkscape. The equation of an ellipse is <math>x^2\/a^2 + y^2\/b^2 = 1.<\/math> In this picture <math>a = 120,\\ b = 84.<\/math> Then the distance from the center of symmetry of the ellipse to any of the two focii is <math>\\sqrt{a^2-b^2} = 86.<\/math> What I measured was 84 or so. So all it takes is a little squashing of an ellipse for its focii to diverge a lot.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Perhaps you folks could start a discussion at a public place somewhere, such as the [[WT:WPM|math wikiproject]]. I'll be happy to implement whatever consensus solution emerges.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: I'll take a look soon.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: The underlying html format changed again, and that was confusing the bot. I put in a fix. Thanks for the report.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: If you need feedback, try asking at [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Mathematics]] for people's views. I myself have quite little time and the topic is too strange to me to be able to comment.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: I turned off the bot in the meantime so that it does not mess anything.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: I switched mathbot to the new lists. Apparently all is well.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: I have not been involved in this for a while, but try following the instructions at [[Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team\/Using the bot]]. If that does not work, try contacting [[User:CBM|CBM]] who runs the bot.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: I think no admin help is necessary. Thanks for doing the work.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: I think that editor is right. But I am not sure if this is a strong policy. If you feel some links are important enough to be included in \""see also\"" even if they are in the main article anyway then I guess it is OK to add them.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: The bot got this info from the [[Harold Neville Vazeille Temperley]] article, at the bottom it says \""[[:Category:2007 deaths]]\"". I just removed that, and the bot will not consider him dead anymore.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: I am on vacation and traveling. I'll look into it perhaps within 4-5 days.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Why would that be wrong? Those are lists of mathematics articles, they should be in math categories, even if they are in the Wikipedia namespace I would think.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: (Very belately.) The bot was not updating the pages properly since the format of Wikipedia's html changed and that confused it. I put in a fix I think. I have it running now, I'll check later if it works.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: Let me summarize, you want the ndash (&ndash;) and the keyword \""born\"", is that right?
[Oleg Alexandrov]: It works.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: I'll implement these two suggestions, hopefully later today.
[Oleg Alexandrov]: I am done with the \""born\"" part. I'll do the ndash thing soon."

I've done my best to clean up the article and incorporate the sources as cites. I think it may now be in good enough condition for you to withdraw the nomination if you agree. What do you think? --

[RexxS]: Your attempts to improve [[Diving watch]] are appreciated, as the article does need work. However, the addition of so many redlinks to articles that will never be created (such as [[FiftyFathoms.net]], [[WatchReport.com]], [[Citizenwatch.co.jp]], etc.) is a disservice to the article. Nobody will take the time to sort out your useful edits from this sort of damage, so your aim of improving the article will be lost. Before making any further edits of this sort, please consider carefully whether there is a realistic chance that an article with the name you are wiki-linking would ever exist on Wikipedia. Thanks --

[RexxS]: May I request that you undo your move from [[Dive tables]] to [[Dive table]], please? [[WP:SINGULAR]] is clear that articles about classes of objects are a specific exception to the general policy. The class consists of many different dive tables and the singular is rarely used, particularly as even a named set will almost always be made up of multiple tables: US Navy tables, B\xfchlmann tables, etc. The singular would be even rarer than the analogous use of \""Hebrew numeral aleph\"" \u2013 the article is still called [[Hebrew numerals]]. --
[RexxS]: I'm no lawyer either, but I'm pretty sure that the US Copyright Act 1909, section 304 applies to the case of a work published before 1978. I believe that would give a 28 year copyrighted term (after first publication) in the first instance, taking us to no later than 1930. Since the work was not-US (as you say its in French), there is an assumption of automatic renewal, which adds a further 67 years to its term of protection \u2013 giving the end of 1997 as the point of expiry. Unless some unforeseen objection is raised, I'd say go ahead and upload it as Public Domain (Copyright expired). If you're not sure, then WAID gives good advice: check it at [[WP:Media copyright questions]]. When you come to do the uploading, have a look at [[WP:Image copyright tags]] for help. --
[RexxS]: Thank you for carrying out the request. I started a move discussion at [[Talk:Dive tables]] to see if my reasoning was correct, but could I ask for your advice on closing that discussion, please? I have no idea how long it should remain open, nor on the etiquette of who is expected to close it. I'm guessing that if no further comments are posted, then closure after a few more days would make sense. Should I be looking for an uninvolved editor to close it at that point? Thanks in advance for any suggestions you are able to make. --
[RexxS]: Hi Locke, I've added three sources to the article. There are 883 stories from ''Spokesman-Review'' [http:\/\/www.spokesman.com\/search\/?q=Hession&x=6&y=13 containing Hession], so you may find something to expand the article if you're interested. --
[RexxS]: I also prefer unit multipliers in multiples of 10^3, so I agree with your edit. It just jogged my memory as I'd used that page to explain to the previous poster what our preferred units were (and thought then that any preference for hPa was a bit odd). --

You ought to be leaving other than the default edit summary when reverting non-vandal edits. Cheers --
[RexxS]: I agree it's a pain in the ass, trying to find something useful to put in place of the default message for an AGF edit; but it must be very dispiriting for a newcomer ip editor when their good-faith contributions get reverted without any reason they can understand.

You could always add the {{tl|unsigned}} template the next time I forget to sign, I won't be offended, honest :) Cheers --
[RexxS]: There's some useful information on how to change an article title at [[Help:Moving a page]] if you need to do it again in future. Essentially, you can usually move the page yourself to a new title. It leaves a redirect behind at the previous title, but if that redirect is unlikely to be helpful to anybody, you can put a {{tl|db-r3}} template on the redirect and it an admin will delete it later. Hope that helps. --
[RexxS]: Anyway, of course I'm happy to help out any way I can. Just let me know. --
[RexxS]: The source is clearly stated as \""British Library\"" within the image. I've added a template including that information to help the bots who can't read image text. It's a pity that [[WP:BEFORE]] doesn't seem to apply to images. *Sigh* --
[RexxS]: I don't think that it's a smart idea to place the notice on the page of a contributor who sadly has not edited for over a year. Despite the fact that the file actually had a description, I've added some extra information to try to keep the bot happy. --
[RexxS]: Agreed, and please accept my apologies, as I wrote the snotty comments for the bot, before I realised you'd justifiably moved the bot notification from your page here. I admit I find these sort of bot notifications irksome, particularly as the apparent reason for the notice turned out to be inaccurate anyway. Still, a few minutes of googling found some extra information on the image, so it should keep the bot from causing you further nuisance. Thanks for your reversion of the vandalism anyway! --
[RexxS]: As a gesture of collegiality, I've made a possible edit to your userpage,{{diff|User:Sundostund|diff=414645653|oldid=414636787}} and self-reverted it to give you some ideas for handling the problems of insufficient padding and the userboxes overflowing the rounded div. Please feel free to ignore, use, or improve these as you wish. I'm happy to explain in detail or help with any problems about markup. Cheers --
[RexxS]: Thank you for your kind words at my talk page. I have to admit that the only thing I could suggest would be to arrange the userboxes into two columns, as I think your page would be able to accommodate the extra width. Would you like me to do that for you? It would mean replacing the {{tl|userboxtop}} and {{tl|userboxbottom}} with direct markup, but I would try to make it understandable for future maintenance. Cheers --
[RexxS]: I've made a two column layout of userboxes for you. Feel free to revert if you don't like it. It would have been a trivial exercise if all the userboxes were exactly the same dimensions, but of course they are not. Anyway, I've added comments to describe what each bit does, in case you want to experiment with modifying it yourself. You have to balance the two columns manually if you want to move the order of the boxes around, but I've marked where each column starts so it's worth experimenting, e.g. to keep all the history stuff together. Have fun! --
[RexxS]: Many thanks, Raul, for the advice on writing blurbs and your specific edit to improve TFL June 13.

[RexxS]: {{ec}} The other effect in place, Elen, is the social effect that one could label 'conspiracy' for want of a better word, when a group of people discuss others in what is assumed to be private. I mean that people are tempted into saying things about others that they would not say to their face (or virtual face). The solution is to internally ''require'' observance of the principle of integrity \u2013 that Arbs who understand that problem remind other Arbs when they overstep the bounds. I can see that that would not help the group to bond, unless the dominant ethos is truly one of openness and integrity, and nobody reading those email exchanges would come to that conclusion at present. Nevertheless, there are sufficient instances of some Arbs being clearly uncomfortable with the unwarranted disparagement of editors that it gives me some hope. I can do no more than encourage you and the other Arbs who understand to take the moral high-ground and hold their \""private\"" exchanges to the highest standards of decorum when discussing others. --
[RexxS]: That's great, and of course [[WP:There is no deadline|there is no deadline]]. I think I've sorted out the {{tl|Expert}} template for you, and I'm probably the major contributor to [[Decompression sickness]], so if you need a hand with anything, give me a shout. --
[RexxS]: While we wait for His Excellency to provide a definitive answer, I can share a little of what I have gleaned. It was Grade I, II, and III in England and Wales, but Grade III was abolished in 1970 (and was non-statutory anyway), and Grade II was split into Grade II* and Grade II, giving the current system of \""special interest (II)\"", \""more than special interest (II*)\"", and \""exceptional interest (I)\"". Of course non-secular buildings used a different scheme as did all buildings in Northern Ireland and Scotland. You could wade through the article [[Listed building]] for more excruciating detail. As for \""Balbardie\"" vs \""Balbarbie\"", there are several Balbardies in West Lothian (Primary School, Archery Club, Hotel, Golf Club, etc.) but no Balbarbie except for the Wikipedia picture (which I would be tempted to rename but I don't have the filemover permission). The article [[Balbardie House]] needs similar copyedits. --
[RexxS]: Thank you Risker, I doubt it's a function that I'll use more than occasionally, but I'll do my best to live up to your expectations. --
[RexxS]: ... And I've copyedited the article [[Balbardie House]] to rectify the typos there. I'll look over the exploding houses soon. Adminship? - I'm a ''content'' editor (yes, I know 1 FA, 1 FL, and 2 GAs isn't much in this august company, but I try). I couldn't even convince ''myself'' I need the tools, so I'd have no chance of convincing the peanut gallery at RfA! --
[RexxS]: I'm never going to be as valuable a member of the entourage (not sure if I don't prefer \""clique\"") as Frutti, but I've added a few thoughts on accessibility. I'll try to revisit the review later and check over the refs when I have a little more time - they need the date formats to be made consistent at the very least. --
[RexxS]: Well, templates are ''supposed'' to help folks format refs in a consistent way, and admins are ''supposed'' to have some sort of need for the tools \u2013 but that's all too difficult for my old dino-brain to get to grips with. Anyway, I've done a little cleaning at [[Destruction of country houses in 20th-century Britain]]: a couple of typos, a few duplicate refs, and I've tried to make titles italic by using the appropriate templates where needed. You might want to cast your eye over it to spot my mistakes; and have a think about whether the listed building grade scheme belongs best in the section on the 1944 Town and Country Planning Act or in the section on the 1947 Town and Country Planning Act. My own preference would be for the latter, as I believe that was when the details were expounded. I'll have another look tomorrow anyway. --"
Juliancolton,True,"[Juliancolton]: Hi. I noticed you started some [[WP:NTROP]] catagories that I have been trying to start for a while. Now, I can't figure out how do add articles to them. Do I put the category name on the articles's talk page, or do I put the names of the articles on the category page? Thanks.
[Juliancolton]: Oh, ok. Thanks.
[Juliancolton]: Thanks for that, It will really help at the project.
[Juliancolton]: Yes, I agree.
[Juliancolton]: Thanks a ton for the review! Happy editing,
[Juliancolton]: I just noticed that while trudging through my morning watchlist. :) Too bad, I was hoping the article would be renamed!<!--<\/sarcasm>--> Oh well, on to the next article...
[Juliancolton]: Wow, that is a big increase in traffic. The articles are very good already, so I don't know how much more work there is to do to 'em! I assmue you sent that message to all the participants of Mission 4, so I couldn't decide whether I needed (or whether you wanted) to respond...
[Juliancolton]: Sure, I'll be happy to give it a look. I'll be busy for the next day or so, so it may be a little while before I get to it.
[Juliancolton]: Alright, I haven't read the entire article yet, but at first glance, I suggest moving the Cityscape header under Geography to its own section, and puting \""Architecture\"" as an H3 header under Cityscape. Not a big deal, but man-made cityscape and architecture doesn't seem like geogtraphy to me. <p>I'll try take an in-depth look once the weekened is over.
[Juliancolton]: Cheers,
[Juliancolton]: Congratulations on the FA!
[Juliancolton]: Hi Nilfanion. I wanted to thank you for your opinion on my RfA, but more importantly, I wanted to ask if you had any more suggestions and advice for me. I'm always open to improvement, and I would appreciate some examples of things I should improve upon. Thanks in advance, &ndash;
[Juliancolton]: Congratulations! Good luck with the tools. &ndash;
[Juliancolton]: Thanks for the reminder; I'll be over there shortly. &ndash;
[Juliancolton]: The other ones haven't had a reply yet, so I'm still unsure about their reliability. Cheers, &ndash;
[Juliancolton]: Unfortunately, Wikipedia policy overrules personal opinion in this particular instance. As I said before, I know little or nothing about the subject, so you might want to ask [[WP:TV]]. I can tell you, however, that unless the episode becomes notable after its airing date, it is likely to remain deleted. Cheers, &ndash;
[Juliancolton]: I, as well as other editors, have explained this several times. The individual episode has to be notable be itself for an article to be created. &ndash;
[Juliancolton]: I've told you several times; unless the episode has gained notability last night, you should do nothing. Thank you. &ndash;
[Juliancolton]: In relation to the above, [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Scorpion0422&diff=prev&oldid=249911038 this post] demonstrates unacceptable behavior. Please remain civil. Thank you. &ndash;
[Juliancolton]: \""Who will be so selfish and arrogant to list his contributions on his personal page. I let my edits speak for themselves\"" is an uncivil comment, and has no place on Wikipedia. We're trying to build an encyclopedia, not to prove other editors wrong, not to attack other editors, and not to demonstrate why we are better than other editors. &ndash;
[Juliancolton]: You're not criticizing, you're being uncivil. You don't have to regard yourself as wrong, but if you continue what is clearly being uncivil, you will be blocked from editing. &ndash;
[Juliancolton]: Sure, I'll take a look sometime tonight. &ndash;
[Juliancolton]: Sure thing, I'll be right over. &ndash;
[Juliancolton]: Whoops! My apologies. It's usually safe to assume that anybody who edits Wikipedia on a regular basis is a male computer geek like myself! ;-) &ndash;
[Juliancolton]: Hi Mike. I appreciate your participation in [[Tropical Storm Erick (2007)]]'s FAC, and I am interesting in hearing your views on why you believe the article should be merged. Thanks, &ndash;
[Juliancolton]: A merge to [[2007 Pacific hurricane season]] would make the Erick section over twice as long as [[2007 Pacific hurricane season#Hurricane Henriette]], a landfalling and deadly storm. &ndash;
[Juliancolton]: I'll have to side with Dylan on this one. :) &ndash;

[Juliancolton]: Hi OhanaUnited. I just finished working on [[Portal:Winter]], and I was wondering if you could give me some suggestions and advice for a potential FPOC. Thanks in advance, &ndash;
[Juliancolton]: Thank you for the helpful tips. Just so I know, how many selected articles\/pictures would you suggest? &ndash;
[Juliancolton]: Well, there has to be a consensus before a close can be made. Sorry for the inconvenience, but a second relist was necessary. Cheers, &ndash;
[Juliancolton]: I don't use the templates for the bot; I use the templates for other editors who may wish to investigate the situation. &ndash;
[Juliancolton]: True, but I feel it saves people time, knowing that the report is already being dealt with. &ndash;
[Juliancolton]: Just wanted to let you know that the issues with the image you pointed out at [[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates\/New York State Route 311]] have been addressed. Thank you for the comments (and for the tireless work you've been doing at FAC lately). Cheers, &ndash;
[Juliancolton]: Got it. Thanks for letting me know. &ndash;
[Juliancolton]: I have nominated {{lc|2008-09 South Pacific cyclone season}} for renaming to {{lc|2008\u201309 South Pacific cyclone season}}. Your opinions on the matter are welcome; please participate in the discussion by adding your comments at [[Wikipedia:Categories for discussion\/Log\/2009 January 13#Category:2008-09 South Pacific cyclone season|the discussion page]].

Overall, I think that if you were to run RfA right now, it would do a lot better than your last one in July. You have ample experience now, so I don't think that should be an issue. Nonetheless, I do see a few potential issues. The general feeling at your past RfAs seems to be that you had you lacked the maturity, knowledge, and integrity to responsibly manage the bit. I do think you have improved in that regard, but I'm not exactly convinced just yet. Looking through [[User talk:Ktr101\/Archive 3]], I see a couple recent concerns regarding copyright issues, and since admins are expected to understand copyright policies, even if at a basic level, I think that might be brought up at RfA. Hunster's comments above are also a tad worrisome, but it seems like a simple mistake, which I'm willing to look past. Additionally, some of the opposition to your most recent adminship candidacy was based on potentially poor-form canvassing. Again, I'll AGF, but I think this might also be pointed out again. All things considered, to be perfectly honest, I don't think you would pass at the moment. I could be wrong, but knowing RfA, it'll be close either way. Your best bet would be to work in some more heavy-duty areas of the project (dispute resolution, copyright investigations, sockpuppets) so you have evidence of a comprehensive understanding of policy. Hope this helps, &ndash;'''

[Juliancolton]: {{ec}} I understand. I'm not faulting you or anything, since I don't know the article's background history, but I just saw it at the RFPP page and figured I'd offer you a nice cup of tea. :) Let me know if I can help in any way. regards,
[Juliancolton]: Please stop making changes to hurricane disambiguation pages; your edits are currently counter-productive, and may be reverted. I'll be happy to explain further. Thank you,
[Juliancolton]: Brief by-storm descriptions within dab pages are a long-standing [[WP:WPTC]] standard. There was no reason to remove them. You've also deleted important links, which I'm a bit confused about.
[Juliancolton]: [[Tropical cyclone]], for example, which is a term most casual readers do not understand. If the descriptions were lengthy, the solution is to shorten them, not remove them altogether; the latter removes useful navigational information.
[Juliancolton]: Why have you removed the descriptions altogether then?
[Juliancolton]: That may be correct, but many readers' knowledge of a particular storm is that \""It was named John and it hit my area\"", and the year is useless to them. On the other hand some may know year of a storm, but not its name. Tropical cyclones are a slightly unusual subject and difficult to write about, so it's necessary to bend the rules a bit in order to make navigation and research easy for casual users.
[Juliancolton]: That would work for me, and it seems like a good compromise. Re. the linking, I've never encountered that issue, as far as I recall, and while it sounds like it would be irritating, I would argue that the vast majority of readers do not use popups, so the benefits of linking complex terms outweigh the downsides. It's not a huge issue, however, since I think [[tropical cyclone]] is linked to on almost every storm article.
[Juliancolton]: Considering that mine have gotten no more than a few hundred in the past, that is indeed quite good!

[TransporterMan]: Welcome to the [[WP:3O|Third Opinion project]] and thank you very much for jumping in and offering some 3O's. Your service to the community is very much appreciated, both at the project and by those that you help. Best regards,
[TransporterMan]: Rather than being deleted, your article has been moved to the [[WP:INCUBATE|Article Incubator]]; to work on it go to [[Wikipedia:Article_Incubator\/Milia_Gataullina]]. \u2014
[TransporterMan]: This nomination apparently never happened, so I removed the hangon tag the page creator added in anticipation of it. \u2014
[TransporterMan]: I note that you speedily deleted [[Kafani]]. I'm confused and am hoping that you might help. In doing hangon patrolling this morning I came across the A7 nom and declined it because I confirmed that the article subject had a charted single at Billboard, meeting [[WP:BAND]] #2. Since a declined speedy cannot ordinarily be reasserted, I'm surprised to see the A7 deletion. Not being a sysop, I can't look back to see what happened. I'm not asking for undeletion or deletion review, I bow to your judgment on that, I just don't understand what happened and would like to know if and how I messed up in declining the speedy. Best regards,
[TransporterMan]: I noticed that you removed a pending request from the list there and declined it in {{diff2|392688343|this edit}}. We very recently adopted a new guideline at [[Wikipedia:Third_opinion#Declining_requests_for_third_opinions]] which says:<blockquote>Even if a request does not fully comply with the guidelines set out here, requests for third opinions should not ordinarily be removed from the list of active disagreements unless a third opinion will be given or unless the request has been listed for more than seven days. If you believe that there is a compelling reason to remove an item from the list for some other reason, it is usually a good idea to discuss the removal on the Third Opinion talk page before taking any action.<\/blockquote>It's so new (and at the bottom of the page to boot) I'm not surprised that you missed it, but just wanted to let you know. Best regards,
[TransporterMan]: I removed a listing from the 3O list because it was a conduct dispute, not a content dispute, which set off the discussion which resulted in [[User:Athaenara|Athaenara]] removing the content restriction and me adding the non removal guideline which I quoted, above. See [[Wikipedia_talk:Third_opinion#Alleged_restrictions_on_disputes|this discussion]]. Since the time that we adopted the staleness guideline (in the next\u2013to\u2013last paragraph of the [[Wikipedia:Third_opinion#How_to_list_a_dispute|How to list a dispute]] section), there seems to be more support for the idea of just leaving disputes on the list to see if anyone will take them regardless of nonconformity and only removing them if no one wants to do so and they become stale. Watching the list over the past few weeks, I've discovered that as a purely practical matter very, very few listed disputes stay on the list long enough to become stale, someone almost always gives an opinion. The thought is that the real value of the 3O project is as a quick and informal opinion by an editor who is a neutral to the disputants and the dispute and that the opinion is not a tiebreaker, i.e. that it doesn't !count towards consensus. The two\u2013editors\u2013only, civility, content\u2013dispute\u2013only, and other restraints make it more likely that 3O will settle the dispute, but if you think about it for a minute there's little harm done if if does not. Moreover, any Wikipedian is free to issue a neutral opinion in a dispute without reference to the 3O project. Best regards,
[TransporterMan]: '''Re your [[WP:3O|Third Opinion]] request:''' The guidelines at the [[WP:3O|Third Opinion project]] say that requests are subject to being removed from the list if no volunteer chooses to provide an opinion within six days after they are listed there. The request made there in reference to this dispute has been removed for that reason. Please feel free to relist if if you still desire a third opinion, but if no one has taken the request in this length of time it may be unlikely that anyone will do so in the future. If you still need help with your dispute after the RFC, you should consider a [[WP:RFC|request for comments]] or [[WP:MEDCAB|informal]] or [[WP:RFM|formal]] mediation as the next step in the [[WP:DR|dispute resolution]] process. Best regards,
[TransporterMan]: I'm a fellow Third Opinion Wikipedian and noticed that you had removed a dispute from the list at the [[WP:3O]] page for having too many editors and being too complex. You may know it already, but the 3O guidelines have recently been  changed to say, near the bottom of the page, \""'''Declining requests for third opinions'''. Even if a request does not fully comply with the guidelines set out here, requests for third opinions should not ordinarily be removed from the list of active disagreements unless a third opinion will be given or unless the request has been listed for more than seven days. If you believe that there is a compelling reason to remove an item from the list for some other reason, it is usually a good idea to discuss the removal on the Third Opinion talk page before taking any action.\"" The seven-day reference is to another relatively recent change which allows disputes to be removed if they they're on the list without being answered for more than seven days. Removing items is not ''prohibited,'' just discouraged (and your removal looks like a good call to me), so I just wanted you to know about the changes if you didn't already. Best regards and thanks for your help with the project,
[TransporterMan]: I'm considering AFD'ing [[2007 Painesville, Ohio train derailment]] now that you've disputed my PROD, but before I do I'd like your thoughts on the matter. In keeping with [[WP:EVENT]] and [[WP:NOTNEWS]], this derailment was, perhaps, important enough to stay up for a few days to see if it was going to have any ongoing notability, but there's no indication that it has. No one was killed, the lawsuits were inevitable and equally inconsequential, it's not being used as a \""poster child\"" event to illustrate the need for some kind of reform, the only things that make it different from hundreds of other derailments were the fire, risk of explosion (which didn't happen), and the evacuation, none of which seem important enough to make the article \""for the ages\"" encyclopedic. Did you de-PROD because you think it ought to exist or was it merely because you think enough doubt exists that a deletion discussion is in order? Or is there something that I have missed? Best regards,
[TransporterMan]: Thanks for the clarification. If you care to jump in, see [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\/2007 Painesville, Ohio train derailment]]. Best regards,
[TransporterMan]: You G12 speedily deleted; it came right back, unchanged. FYI,
[TransporterMan]: Back again as userbox only. I've G11'ed it in light of what's gone before. Regards,
[TransporterMan]: From the last couple of messages above, I get the impression that you have established, somewhere, that the large number of soft redirects you are creating to Wiktionary are acceptable under policy here. I'm tempted to take them to [[WP:RFD]], but before I make a fool of myself \u2014 I've done so enough times already, thank you very much \u2014 I was hoping that you might enlighten me. I don't doubt that they ought to pass a speedy deletion nomination, but I don't know why they should survive RFD. Can you enlighten me? Regards,
[TransporterMan]: Yes, and I don't find it there, though authority might arguably come from a link on that page to [[Wikipedia:Deletion_policy#Other_projects]]. The criteria for the existence of the soft redirect would appear to be \""''If an article to be deleted is likely to be re-created under the same name, it may be turned into a soft redirect to a more appropriate sister project's article. This is especially true for Wiktionary.''\"" I have some doubt just how likely it would be for articles on \""foozle\"" and \""foofaraw,\"" or even \""expediency,\"" to be recreated if they were to be deleted here at WP. Rather than get into an article by article debate over what would be likely to be recreated and not, I'm hoping, however, that you have some better authority than that which will show my concerns to be clearly misplaced. Do you? Regards,
[TransporterMan]: Not quite sure why you were listed as the creator of that page, but I've withdrawn the nomination since you moved it while I was nominating it and it's been prodded. Regards,
[TransporterMan]: Saw that you're another ''well-seasoned'' editor, like me (you were born in the [[Clement Attlee|Attlee]] adminstration, I believe; I in the [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]]), so looking forward to your reply with no hurry. Regards,
[TransporterMan]: If you think that this notice was placed here in error, contest the deletion by clicking on the button labelled \""Click here to contest this speedy deletion,\"" which appears inside of the speedy deletion (<code><nowiki>{{db-...}}<\/nowiki><\/code>) tag (if no such tag exists, the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate). Doing so will take you to the talk page where you will find a pre-formatted place for you to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. You can also visit the '''[[Talk:Ruth Glass|the page's talk page directly]]''' to give your reasons, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.  <!-- Template:Db-copyvio-notice --> <!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom -->

His reactions, ineptness with tools, tossing around of terms such as \""criminal\"", acknowledgment of but refusal to learn or accept Wikinorms, and statements such as, \""And if you ban, I shall set up another editorship and ther ain't nothing you can do but steal my computer,\"" are disturbing. Whatever you want to do, if anything, is fine, of course, it's your call, but I wanted you to know that the drama is continuing. Best regards,
[TransporterMan]: The ultimate problem, and the one that cause me to ask for Swedish-language help, is that I don't know whether he understands what I've just said and is lashing out because he doesn't like it or whether he doesn't understand it and will accept it (even if he doesn't like it) once he does. Or I could have completely misunderstood everything. Best regards,
[TransporterMan]: Reverted, seeing as you're a regular, but please add reliable sources as soon as possible, taking [[WP:CRYSTAL]] into consideration. Regards,
[TransporterMan]: I cannot say for sure because I did not delete it, I just nominated it for deletion.

[TransporterMan]: Hi, Steven, I'm a [[WP:3O|Third Opinion Wikipedian]]. Let me recommend that [[Wikipedia:Dispute_resolution_noticeboard#Dartmouth_College]] be closed. One of the editors in that dispute {{diff2|441079734|requested}} a Third Opinion (though it was from an IP, it was almost certainly [[User:NBruschi|NBruschi]] based on the edit pattern at the article talk page) while the other, a few minutes later, listed it at DRN. While I don't see the DRN listing as being an attempt at canvassing, in the current [[WP:DR|DR]] hierarchy 3O is a higher form of DR than DRN and DRN says that it shouldn't be used if any other form of discussion is pending. Though no 3O has yet been given, the DRN listing ought to be closed. (I'm not certain that 3O ''should'' be higher, BTW; indeed, I feel pretty strongly that DRN, or CNB if it survives, ought to come after 3O in the hierarchy, but that's not the way it is right now.)

[TransporterMan]: Steven, let me start by applauding you for trying to improve DR.

Now down to suggestions: As I implied in my comment {{diff2|441537104|here}}, I don't think there's currently enough to distinguish DRN from RFC. I'm an old hand at 3O and if I correctly surmise what's implied in your comments just above, I'd guess that the difference that ''you'' see is that DRN is intended to be much earlier and much less formal than RFC, perhaps something akin to [[WP:EA]] with a dispute on the table or 3O with answers from multiple editors rather than just one. Could I suggest that DRN might distinguish itself from the other DR processes by expressly providing that the opinions and resolutions given are ''non-binding?'' 3O has that provision and what it means, at least in my opinion, is that Third Opinions do not \""count\"" towards consensus on the matter in dispute. That turns a 3O into something approaching advice, not consensus-building. By doing so, DRN would come to be something like a 4th Opinion source. Whether or not you think that is a good idea, let me also recommend that you take a look at the neutrality requirements at 30, add something like them to DRN, and require people entering the discussion to identify themselves as either \""involved\"" or \""neutral\"" with neutrality based on those standards.

Though I'm not sure that the process for doing so is entirely clear (for reasons I've stated [[Wikipedia:Village_pump_(policy)\/Archive_82#Practice_vs_philosophy:_Balancing_AGF.2C_IAR.2C_POLICY.2C_and_BITE|here]]), I think that except in a few mostly-legally-related exceptions (negative unsourced BLP information, copyright, child protection, and perhaps one or two others), that it is always possible to make a [[WP:IAR|IAR]] local exception to policy. Do you disagree? Best regards,"
EGMichaels,False,"[EGMichaels]: Hi Peter -- I just responded to a good question you raised on the Nestle-Aland talk page.  I agree that Wikipedia is a mixed bag, and I've had to retreat myself.  You're quite right that there are too many people with too many agendas.  I'm lately looking into two areas that I have a lot of resources on but few people care to add -- textual criticism and story theory.  Just adding sources to document little fought areas might be a good way to take a break and still benefit the Encyclopedia.  While many people have agedas on \""Christianity\"", I've found that not so many have agendas on which text forms map to which manuscripts -- or which story theory agrees with Aristotle and which with Jung!  I think what I'm trying to say is that Wikipedia is a big place.  The least controversial areas are sometimes the best places to take a vacation in.  There's always a book on your shelf that can supply some footnote somewhere!
[EGMichaels]: DJ -- thanks for your note.  After looking it up it appears that I confused the Anchor Bible commentaries with the Anchor Bible.  While the commentaries are well done (and do contain full translations), the Anchor Bible is something incomplete.  I own some of the commentaries but not the \""Anchor Bible\"" that the original editor had in mind.  Good catch.
[EGMichaels]: Just wanted to say, it's a pleasure working with you.  The give and take makes the article (and us) better.  Thanks.
[EGMichaels]: Carlaude, could you take a look at this page?  The old umbrella article \""Creation according to Genesis\"" was turned into a more limited subject matter that, while encyclopedic, shouldn't be the default.  I don't know whether there needs to be a new umbrella or not.  There are currently articles covering Genesis as allegory, framework, fact, and now myth.  I think \""literature\"" is left out, and an umbrella article could point to all of them.  But I could be too close to the article, so I'd like another opinion.  Thanks.
[EGMichaels]: Hi Carlaude -- the ones I have in mind are [[Allegorical interpretations of Genesis]], [[Creationism]], [[Genesis creation myth]], and [[Framework interpretation (Genesis)]].  What's missing is an umbrella article such as [[Genesis Creation Account]] and something like [[Genesis Creation Literary Analysis]] (this last could be based on Alter to begin with).  The umbrella article could link to and summarize all of the views and show how creation in Genesis is interpreted in a literary context, in its relation to or repudiation of ancient Near East myths, a structural analysis, allegorical methods, and the history of those who have taken it most literally.  That's basically a need for one article [[Genesis Creation Literary Analysis]] and a summary umbrella article [[Genesis Creation Account]].  At least, that's my thinking.  Does this make sense to you?  I think what I'm asking for is a sanity check and maybe some help.  You've always seemed to have a level head."

William Avery,False,"[William Avery]: I was looking at COD (2002 I think, don't have it to hand at work). It gave, as I recall, something man made (the sense in which archaeologists use it) and an error that arises from an experimental method (artefacts in a photomicrograph etc). (I hope an article on curry doesn't require usages found only in a larger dictionary.) The real problem is the idea that a loan word need necessarily have the same meaning in the borrowing language that it has in the donor language, and that if it doesn't then some kind of error or 'inaccuracy' has occurred. It is borrowed to fill a linguistic hole, and its meaning will be tuned according to the purposes of the borrowing language to fit that hole. i.e. a generic word was required for the relatively highly spiced Indian dishes which had no name in English and are now called curries; the word borrowed for this purpose may have meant sauce in Tamil, but the mismatch of meanings between the two languages is not an error or inaccuracy in either. This is why I also have a problem with calling it 'inaccurate'. It has a quite reasonably precise, if generic, meaning in English, which can in no way be beholden to its Tamil origin. Election 'candidates' don't have to wear white any more, do they?
[William Avery]: Yes. I just put it into the link to be consistent with the Gutenberg catalog.

[William Avery]: [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Richard_I_of_England&diff=prev&oldid=286456987 Another one] I sometimes use.
[William Avery]: [[Listen to the Mocking Bird]] - [[To Kill a Mockingbird]]. It must have become a single word somewhere in the intervening century. Ho hum...
[William Avery]: I sympathise, but I don't understand much Italian, and the Italian wikipedia is separate from the English Wikipedia.
[William Avery]: All reversions of vandalism. Please provide a diff for the edit on June 8 to which you refer.
[William Avery]: yep. As I realised after reverting. It's the not using an edit summary that's a PITA.
[William Avery]: [[WP:AGF]], [[WP:MASTODON]].
[William Avery]: Replied on article talk.
[William Avery]: I agree. I don't think it worth doing anything formal at this stage - we might hope that somebody will realise they are in a minority of one.
[William Avery]: Gone. But see [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Special:WhatLinksHere\/Template:User_Grammar_nazi other pages using that template]. You could list [[Template:User_Grammar_nazi]] at [[WP:MFD]].
[William Avery]: Yes, my summary was wrong.  It was a 'false scent' I felt between the normal meaning of \""[[species]]\"" and specific term \""[[chemical species]]\"" that I wanted to iron out.
[William Avery]: Please discuss this at [[talk:Bertie Ahern]].
[William Avery]: Not sure why you are asking me - I thought the user was spamming. Only [[:File:Angela Craciun 2009.jpg]] has a valid licence tag. The user seems to be representing http:\/\/www.wdscenter.ro\/
[William Avery]: Most material would be retained by leaving the ones under \""Clapton's guitars\"" and removing the ones that are used in articles about individual bands or songs.
[William Avery]: Seems to have been resolved now.
[William Avery]: As the hatnote says, \""For the fictional character, see [[Ali Baba]].\""
[William Avery]: The level of warning I issued is consistent with what Cluebot or Huggle would deliver, ignoring previous messages over 24 hours old. If the IP was consistently returning to one article I would ignore that and ramp up the level regardless of the time interval. In my experience failure to ignore old vandalism will lead to admins declining requests at [[WP:AIV]] by saying there is not enough recent vandalism, or the warnings given were improper. See [[Wikipedia:WikiProject_user_warnings\/Help:Introduction#Edits_from_IP_addresses]].
[William Avery]: Re your P.S., sorry about that. \""waste of time and effort expended by Wikipedians reverting anonymous vandalism\"": tell me about it!
[William Avery]: The was report was filed automatically by [[WP:HG|Huggle]] when I reverted some vandalism, and that seems to be the way it works. Do you think it's a bug?
[William Avery]: Oops - I just noticed its a different IP address - so definitely a bug.
[William Avery]: No problem. There is a 'move' tab, at the top of the page to the right of 'edit' & 'history'.
[William Avery]: I'm feeling a little dizzy after reading that. I am tempted to suggest pruning it with an axe rather than secateurs, but that's rather facetious.
[William Avery]: Excellent.
[William Avery]: Not quite 'vandalism', more a lack of competence, I'd say. I'd guess the involved IPs have a conflict of interest, but I think their concern over coatracking is justified. I can understand dislike for the characterisation '[[Gay bathhouse|bathhouse]]'. I'm only going to do what's necessary to get rid of an article which I don't think should exist.
[William Avery]: I changed the existing links from [[Henry Doubleday]] to [[Henry Doubleday (1808\u20131875)]]. The other [[Henry Doubleday (1810-1902)]] was a  starch manufacturer and horticulturist who only published works on horticulture. Now that I look a little more closely it is evident that the pre-existing link to  [[Henry Doubleday]] was wrong and it should in fact be be [[Edward Doubleday]].  As in \""Doubleday, E.,1842 : ''Characters of undescribed Lepidoptera''\"". Is this your understanding too? I will try cross checking the [[Henry Doubleday (1808\u20131875)]] attributions with Wikispecies and known publication dates, and bear in mind that it was Edward who travelled to America and worked on the BMNH collection.
[William Avery]: I see, thank you.
[William Avery]: Jon Bernstein, who covered the Victoria Rooms lecture, quotes you (a \""Wikipedian, identified by his username RodW\""). Not available online, only in the print edition.
[William Avery]: The para about you is fine. I haven't read the whole thing yet.
[William Avery]: Sorry, no.
[William Avery]: Thank you. I've added myself to the list.
[William Avery]: ::OK. I'll stop bitchin' about how PowerPoint rots the brain and fire up Office."
Ekerazha,False,"[Ekerazha]: --
[Ekerazha]: I've added a task to the \""To Do List\""."
Sir Rhosis,False,"[Sir Rhosis]: I noticed you removed the word \""penultimate\"" from the article \""All Our Yesterdays.\""  It is indeed the penultimate episode.  Look the word up, then correct your revisions, please.
[Sir Rhosis]: Okay, I will do the work for you.  \""Penultimate\"" means \""the next to last.\"" It does not mean \""the very last.\""  \""All Our Yesterdays\"" comes right before \""Turnabout Intruder.\""  Thus \""All Our Yesterdays\"" is indeed the penultimate episode.  You're welcome.
[Sir Rhosis]: Hi, glad to see another fan of the movies has been creating articles.  I've done quite a few myself recently, including all three of Mike Henry's.  Hey, I was planning to do articles on Buster Crabbe's \""Tarzan the Fearless\"" and Glenn Morris' \""Tarzan's Revenge\"" in the next couple days.  I wanted to get with you and make sure I didn't step on your toes in case you were planning to do them.  Let me know.  Thanks.
[Sir Rhosis]: I went ahead and created the articles.  Again, hope you weren't planning to.
[Sir Rhosis]: Hi, me again.  I'm getting ready to do the article for ''[[Tarzan and the Huntress]]'', so by the time you're up and read this, hopefully that link won't be red.  Wanted to run a couple things by you.  One:  I'm considering writing an article for the cheapie 1999 Sony Wonder animated film called \""Tarzan of the Apes.\""  Yes, it was cheesy and has no voice credits and would be a skimpy article, BUT it was made with ERB Inc.'s permission and is an \""official\"" release, just like the other animated Tarzan films.  Would you consider putting it in your Tarzan film box if I do the article?  Two, have you ever considered doing a film box (I'm talking about that big blue box you made and attached to all the Tarzan film articles, in case my inaccurate language may confuse you) for the various Tarzan TV shows.  There'd be the Ely series, the \""Lord of the Jungle\"" Saturday morning series, the Joe Lara ''[[Tarzan in Manhattan]]'' telefilm, the Tarzan the ecologist series with the tick mark over the second \""a\"", the Joe Lara 1996 \""Epic Adventures\"" series and finally the early 2000s animated series based on the Disney film.  Just thought it might be something you would like to do.  I could give it a go if you don't want to, but I'm fairly slow at these things -- whenever I create a film article, I just copy and paste an old one into the new article's blank box and go through and change the names, dates, casts, plot, etc., by hand.  Anyway, I enjoy your articles.  Your plots synopses are so much better than mine -- I just put enough in there to get by with, meaning to expand them someday.  Best to you.
[Sir Rhosis]: As promised here is my review of the Sony Wonder animated film:  [[Tarzan of the Apes (1999 film)|Tarzan of the Apes]]."
Pascal666,False,"[Pascal666]: I saw a commercial on TV the other day where Donald Trump made a comment along the lines of \""my hair is recognized the world over\"".  I got curious what that meant, the article on him said nothing about his hair.  Finally found on other websites that he had a comb over described with different synonyms for horrendous.  I agree the sentence needs to be changed, but I would like to keep a link to [[comb over]] somewhere on [[Donald Trump]], as that is the information I was looking for and did not find.  I can't comment on the other paragraph.  --
[Pascal666]: Perfect.  Thank you.  --
[Pascal666]: Text was moved to the template. --
[Pascal666]: Yes, sorry, wanted to get all the pages done before anyone complained about the duplicate text.  Didn't occur to me the opposite could be a problem.  Sorry.  --
[Pascal666]: Just fixing it so it would show up in the NPOV category and could eventually be fixed.  I have not even read the article.  --
[Pascal666]: Please read the usage docs on the template itself.  My edit summary is simply a direct quote.  --
[Pascal666]: <nowiki>{{{key}}}<\/nowiki> is not a valid sort key.  I have changed it to reflect the article name however.  --
[Pascal666]: You forgot the \""User:\"" prefix when you created the pages.  Also, you don't actually have to remove the categories, just comment them out with <nowiki>\""<!--\"" and \""-->\""<\/nowiki> before and after.  Thanks!  --
[Pascal666]: Thank you. I hope those tags don't screw up your subst. On an unrelated note, do you know of any way in a template to move the last name before the first? For example, get \""Doe, John P.\"" from an article named \""John P. Doe\""? Thanks! --
[Pascal666]: Please be careful in the future when changing an article to a redirect that you are not creating a [[Wikipedia:Double redirects|double redirect]] like you did at [[Saint Andrew's Cross]].  I have fixed them all for you this time.  --
[Pascal666]: The sentence \""The check digit happens to coincide.\""  If I was the publisher, I would have intentionally found a pair of matching ISBNs, including check digit.  They may indeed just happen to coincide, but Wikipedia requires proof.  Stating the fact that they coincide is one thing, stating they happen to coincide is quite another.  Unless a source is found stating that they just happen to coincide, language along the lines of \""and chooses to use the same item number including the check digit\"" would be more neutral.  --
[Pascal666]: It would be trivial for the publisher two find two ISBNs that match.  If they went to the trouble of finding a three digit match, why not four?  They own all ISBNs that start with 038796 and 354096.  Think how easy it would be to calculate the checksum for every ISBN in those ranges (1000 in each) and find two that match.  Although, I just did it myself, and found something peculiar.  Turns out the check digit for every isbn in those two ranges match.  --
[Pascal666]: [[:Image:Autorecessive.jpg]] is incorrect.  I left a message on the talk page nearly two months ago to this effect.  This was also mentioned at [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Medical Genetics\/Guidelines]] over a year ago.  That is where the SVG was introduced and the only comment made was the circles should be bigger, which was done.  The red\/blue\/purple color scheme was also mentioned there without objection, though it was noted the original color scheme may be even better.  The most common type of color blindness is green\/red.  This is why traffic signals use a blue\/green instead of a pure green.  The SVG uses blue instead of green, and would be perfectly visible to the vast majority of those with color blindness.  I happen to agree with you on the color scheme, but I would rather have a correct image than a good looking one.  [[:File:Autodominant.jpg]] is also incorrect and needs to be replaced, however there does not appear to be an equivalent SVG.  If you have a suggestion for better colors, please leave a message on one of the talk pages.  If you simply like the original colors better than the new, leave a message for the author of the SVG, [[User:Cburnett]].  Perhaps in addition to changing the colors they would also be willing to make a similar version of Autodominant as well.  --
[Pascal666]: [[User:Stepheng3]] placed [[:Category:Pages that use the Sockpuppet category template incorrectly]] in [[:Category:Wikipedia template cleanup]].  When I came across [[:Category:Wikipedia disambig or set index box parameter needs fixing]] I put it in the same place.  You reverted this saying that category was for template pages that need fixing.  I agreed with you.  There was no central category for articles whose template parameters need fixing, so I created one.  If you have a suggestion for a better name, let me know and I will move everything over.  My goal right now is to get all the template parameter sanity checking categories (not the articles inside them) cleaned up, starting with getting them documented and categorized.  --
[Pascal666]: The template automatically detects if the page exists.  Once it is deleted those links go away.  --
[Pascal666]: Thank you.  The only problem with making the templates automatically update like that is that they will always show on the \""what links here\"" page even though they do not display a link to the user.  This is a limitation of the #ifexist [[mw:Help:Extension:ParserFunctions|ParserFunction]].  So if you click on the redlink above and then \""what links here\"" you cannot tell which pages actually have a link to that one and which would only have a link if the page existed without looking at each individual page.  --
[Pascal666]: Was any discussion made of whether submarine articles should be placed in the ship launch categories such as was done [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=SM_UC-106&diff=283509057&oldid=282719173 here]?  --
[Pascal666]: Thank you.  I am not interested in revisiting the issue, I just wanted to make sure that it had in fact been discussed before.  --
[Pascal666]: Please be careful when creating or restoring cleanup categories to make sure they are themselves categorized.  [[:Category:Articles with trivia sections from March 2007]] was linked to from [[:Category:Articles with trivia sections]] until you restored it as a blank page.  Once you did that it was no longer linked to from [[:Category:Articles with trivia sections]] and so could not be easily found by people working to cleanup that category.  I have added {{tl|MonthlyCleanupCat}} to it so it will now show up again.  --
[Pascal666]: No.  I just created the list per your request, and documented it.  I will update it for you when the database dumps are updated (every couple months).  --
[Pascal666]: Already working on it.  For now, it works best if you load each page once, and then open the articles in new tabs.  Thank you for your help.  --
[Pascal666]: Yes, just purge the page and the ones that have been fixed will go away.  I have created pages for the first 10,000 articles on this list so far.  I will create the rest as time permits.  This list is based off of the database dumps.  A new dump comes out every 3-4 months or so.  When the next dump comes out I will re-run the report and update the pages with new articles.  --
[Pascal666]: If you move the comment outside of the category it can get separated from it.  There is nothing wrong with the way they are now.  They work perfectly.  The only reason to note them at all is that someone needs to find a reliable reference for the information and remove the comment after confirming it.  --
[Pascal666]: Why did you delete [[:Category:Wikipedia articles with plot summary needing attention from January 2007]] with 16 articles in it?  --
[Pascal666]: Sorry, my mistake (obviously).  Thought that was rather strange.  --
[Pascal666]: Close, but actually I just created the [[Wikipedia:Subpages|subpage]] using some of the syntax from your page, so it was kind of a group effort.  --
[Pascal666]: As it was intended.  I spent a little time a couple months ago trying to get something similar working and never did.  Thanks for adding those.  --
[Pascal666]: Click on [[:Category:Categories for deletion]], scroll down to \""Subcategories\"", see the categories like \""CfD 2009-04\""?  These are the monthly categories.  Their naming scheme is so far from standard you didn't even recognize them.  --
[Pascal666]: No, I am not an admin.  Thank you for making those changes.  --
[Pascal666]: Per [[Wikipedia:Categorization#Using sort keys]]: \""To ensure that entries differing by letter case appear together, apply the convention that initial letters of words are capitalized in the sort key, but other letters are lower case.\""  The articles to which you refer have a word that starts with a lowercase letter in the title.  All such articles need to have a DEFAULTSORT added to them with the initial letters of each word capitalized.  --
[Pascal666]: All versions of AWB after {{awbsvn|4340}} include this as a general fix.  More information can be found at [[Wikipedia talk:AutoWikiBrowser\/Bugs#DEFAULTSORT capitalization]].  --
[Pascal666]: Yeah, I was not involved in the initial policy discussion or the discussion about adding it to AWB, but the more I think about it the more I think we would be better off having [[MediaWiki]] treat sort keys as case-insensitive.  I just don't have time right now to do anything about it.  --
[Pascal666]: No.  --
[Pascal666]: I assume you are referring to [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Highbury_%26_Islington_station&diff=301145885&oldid=300684246 this] edit in which I changed the category for [[Highbury & Islington station]] from [[:Category:Victoria line stations]] to [[:Category:Victoria Line stations]].  The red link in the edit summary and in the previous sentence indicate that the lower case category does not exist.  The only article in the lowercase category at the time I made the change was the article that I changed, and it is now empty.  The uppercase category exists and has 16 articles in it.  I have no opinion as to which case is correct.  I was simply moving an article from a non-existent category that had only it as a member, to an existent category with 15 other similar members.  I would neither object to nor endorse your creating the lowercase category, moving all 16 articles to it, and nominating the uppercase category for deletion.  --
[Pascal666]: Looks like vandalism to me.  I removed it.  --
[Pascal666]: Your edits were flagged as probable vandalism because you broke a template & the birth category.  After reviewing your edits and seeing you removed her birth year instead of correcting it, did not cite any [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable sources]] for the information you added ([[Wikipedia:Primary Secondary and Tertiary Sources|primary sources]] are not allowed), and removed some information that did have a cited source, I reverted your edits.  --
[Pascal666]: Thank you.  --
[Pascal666]: When using HotCat, please click on the \xb1 next to a red category before removing it from a page.  Had you done this at [[Microsoft Innovation Center]] you would have seen that the correct name for [[:Category:Innovation Organizations]] is [[:Category:Innovation organizations]].  To see how this works, you can goto the old version of this page before you removed the category [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Microsoft_Innovation_Center&oldid=384159186 here] and click on the \xb1 next to the red category.  Thank you.  --
[Pascal666]: I was unable to revert your edit at that page due to intervening edits, but I was able to revert your change at [[Paras TV]] so you can see how this looks [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Paras_TV&action=history here].  --
[Pascal666]: Wasn't me.  I believe you [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=John_Charles_Cutler&diff=388309837&oldid=388306764 meant] [[User:Tripodian]]  --
[Pascal666]: Yes, thank you.  You are correct.  If the date changes from current to old after I added that code, the page will not get categorized into [[:Category:Pufc cleanup old]] until either the page or template are edited again.  For my current purposes this doesn't matter.  Currently the goal of these categories is only to cleanup old transclusions, not to maintain them going forward (thus my edit summary \""add temporary cleanup cats\"").  This template is currently transcluded over 1,200 times.  A sampling of pages it is transcluded in show it to need to be removed about 80% of the time.  Many instances should have been removed over a year ago.  For example, [[Benjamin Becker]] is currently in [[:Category:Pufc cleanup old]] with a date of 3 September 2009 (yes, I confirmed this is the correct date).  This is the type of page I am currently concerning myself with.  I have not yet considered how to maintain this template moving forward.  --
[Pascal666]: --
[Pascal666]: Are you sure [[:Category:Singlechart usages for Billboard Pop Songs]] is used by {{tl|singlechart}}?  Looks to me like it is using [[:Category:Singlechart usages for Billboardpopsongs]].  --
[Pascal666]: Please see [[Template talk:Pufc#Non-existent categories]].  --
[Pascal666]: Thank you for bringing this to my attention.  --
[Pascal666]: --
[Pascal666]: Please read the source code of my suggestion by clicking edit.  Note that I used {{tl|redirect2}} in order to fix the quotes and stop the non-existent pages from tripping [[:Category:Missing redirects]].  --

[SusanLesch]: Hello, Elkman. You seem to be the person most likely to know. Do you have any idea where to find [[Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church (Minneapolis, Minnesota)|Our Lady of Lourdes]] in a Web site that would establish that it is a [[National Historic Landmark]]? The Minnesota Historical Society [http:\/\/nrhp.mnhs.org\/DistrictPropDetails.cfm?DistrictID=5315 lists it], but the federal databases that I checked don't find either First Universalist Church or the newer name. Nor does Wikipedia [[List_of_National_Historic_Landmarks_by_state#Minnesota|list]] show it. Could it be tied to the historic district? -
[SusanLesch]: Thanks a lot, yes I think the Minneapolis Public Library history says the church was a landmark on its own in 1934 (and the Dept. of the Interior survey drawings at the LOC are dated 1934). As it stands the CP designation is enough to justify the NRHP infobox it deserves, thanks very much. Elkman, that is fantastically good news that the Minneapolis History article is in your hands. Yessir I will let you know if I run into any topics for it. Best wishes. -

[SusanLesch]: Your review was enouraging, and thanks for taking time to edit, too. I made one change to the TOC (having only one item with second level headings looked funny so I moved health to a new section with utilites like [[Boston]]) and decided to hold off a bit before FAC. -

[SusanLesch]: MPR does credit photographers, in this case at the end of the slideshow. Pardon the strike to correct that above. It is terribly sad to watch but I can confirm MPR added credits for Elkman above and beyond the call of duty. Very kind of them and nice of you for creating the bridge article and photographs, Elkman. -

[SusanLesch]: Hi, Jeffq. \""ce\"" means \""copyedit\"". It is a shorthand I learned from a member of WikiProject Biography. \""No idea\"" is pretty straightforward.

By the way apologies I accidently posted this to your user page (gone now I hope). -
[SusanLesch]: OK deal. I will edit [[Michael Bloomberg]] again.

[SusanLesch]: Welcome back. Elkman and Appraiser, could you possibly help me with the user who has been escalating and is now prolonging whatever on the talk page of [[Star Tribune]]? -
[SusanLesch]: Easy for you to say. I could have dropped dead of a heart attack. No I am not kidding. -
[SusanLesch]: Yesterday 25 [[pigeon]]s flew over and landed on the [http:\/\/www.pheasantsforever.org\/page\/PheasantFest.jsp National Pheasant Fest] 25th Anniversary billboard on 50th Street and Xerxes Avenue in southwest [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]. An exaggeration and I spilled hot cocoa on my winter coat which will now need to be dry cleaned. So the net cost of this incident is neglible, weighed in the balance of all things you see. Users Angela and SilkTork took care of this, with some help from Users Bobak, SEWilco and Appraiser and a cast of Lord, or Lady, or Whatever one may prefer, knows how many billion people. When I was your age this was called the [[Butterfly effect]], a relative of [[chaos theory]] and [[zero population growth]] which at the time was known as ZPG. But you would have no way to know this, Elkman. Nor that one [[US letter]] [[Canon]] print of [http:\/\/flickr.com\/photos\/edyson\/2048860026\/ this photo] was a prize for one of the recipients of [http:\/\/www.textet.com\/ Best Editor of All Time].

I wonder, would you and whomever and Appraiser and whomever and whomever else I didn't get a chance to speak to at the Minnesota Wikipedia meetup would be interested? I will be in Minneapolis until mid-January. -
[SusanLesch]: Changed my mind. I think the three of us should go, if that is possible (unlikely) and all right with you and Appraiser. They said they opened in the 1930s.

But I don't think they did. If you have a moment could you look at the church's entry on the MNHS [http:\/\/nrhp.mnhs.org\/DistrictProperties.cfm?NPSNum=71000438 85 properties] list? I don't see any update that would change the [[List_of_contributing_properties_in_the_St._Anthony_Falls_Historic_District|List of contributing properties in the St. Anthony Falls Historic District]]. As background, when you discovered that it is not a landmark I checked with MNHS and as I recall they said they would look into updating their list, and take a look at the church in particular. Sorry I have forgotten now if I called them or wrote email. But in any case the \""National Register Contribution\"" for the church remains blank. It doesn't say N or Y. -
[SusanLesch]: Glad you have an AIA book. I wrote to Ms. Roth at MNHS and asked if 1) the blanks are all contributing properties, and 2) if there is another online source. -
[SusanLesch]: Hello, Elkman. If you have photos of the meetup at Pracna on Main could you kindly send them to me by email or upload them? Did you take any or hand off your camera? I thought I asked before but can't recall. Thanks. -
[SusanLesch]: Yes, the church ought to be a \""Y\"". So should the Ard Godfrey house, so this [[List_of_contributing_properties_in_the_St._Anthony_Falls_Historic_District|list]] of 85 is too short, at minimum in these two important cases and likely in others. As of today no update, so no source, yet though maybe \""quarterly\"". Thank you again. -
[SusanLesch]: The steam plant might be another one. Then I would truly be overjoyed. We'll see. -
[SusanLesch]: Woops now Canon QA got that too. -
[SusanLesch]: Out of respect I will try to refrain from posting here again in February 2008 and remove a Canon sign on my commons users page. Hoping for your speedy recovery and maybe an idea of the ship where this happened. -
[SusanLesch]: Inside, outside, any and all photos you have time to upload are wonderful. -
[SusanLesch]: Hello, Tone. Your name was mentioned [[Talk:Main_Page#Errors_in_In_the_news|here]] as a person who might be able to help. Best wishes. -
[SusanLesch]: Greetings from a stranger lucky to hear you today. Beautiful job, you did Wikipedia proud. -
[SusanLesch]: Hi, Bookworm857158367, you know I love this article, always have. Sadly I don't think [[Allegra Byron]] was eligible for DYK because it would have had to be a five-fold expansion. I'll leave a note at DYK or main page. -
[SusanLesch]: We're okay! Somebody at DYK goofed; only one other person noticed afterwards. Good luck to you on your articles. I still remember from WikiProject Biography. -
[SusanLesch]: Hello, Elkman. If I deny these cookies (just for example--I deny everything that can be dispensed with and still have a site function, usually) does that mean my profile is recorded as my IP address? 2o7, advertising, atdmt, att, bridgetrack, collarity, contextweb, doubleclick, google, hitbox, insightexpress, mcclatchyinteractive, questionmarket, realmedia, revsci, specificclick, tacoda, ugamsolutions, zwire. Sorry for the off topic question. Louise Story published [http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2008\/03\/10\/technology\/10privacy.html this] last month and got me thinking again. If you don't know the answer, any idea of where to ask might be interesting. Thank you in advance. -
[SusanLesch]: Well I tried to look this up but am coming up ignorant for lack of experience on a commercial site. RFCs 2616 and 2965 talk about IP addresses in relation to servers and hosts (not clients). I wondered if (just for example), tacoda and whatever site (tacoda's partner, or customer) I am visiting have shared access to my IP address. If they do I might as well accept all cookies. -
[SusanLesch]: While I am writing and on another off-topic topic, for Firefox users, the [https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/addon\/722 NoScript] add-on is the best measure out there according to [[TidBITS]]'s security expert. Regular malware protection on your platform is of course necessary (in Mac OS they'll find &lt;90% but they are still building a Mac product at Symantec and some people like [[Clam AntiVirus|Clam-AV]]. I use [[FRISK Software International|F-Prot]] on the Windows side). NoScript does require that scripts be enabled as needed, on-demand and per-site, and has some effect on appearance in some cases. I'll be sure to add more here as I think of it! Dear cookie monster thank you for keeping me alert. -
[SusanLesch]: Yes, unless one of them buys out the other, 2o7 wouldn't share with casalemedia, but the question is does the partner, for example, 2o7 have the IP addresses in its customers' server log files--do sites and their cookie-requesting partners share IP address data. I'll try the reference desk, thank you very much. If a picture is worth a thousand words, that video would cause a buffer overflow. Congratulations on best of show! -
[SusanLesch]: Or vice president. With a coach like Balloonman there is still time. \u2014
[SusanLesch]: Hi, Appraiser. Pardon a note out of the blue. Saw your note elsewhere about [[User:Appraiser\/Wikipedia Panel ideas|this panel]] and may have some additions if you'd like them, in part from researching an article about Wikipedia recently. If this is for the 2009 conference let me know your focus and if would like suggestions. I sent you some email on another topic. Best wishes. -
[SusanLesch]: Thank you. Done for now. Added history and Stallman, Google's effect, number of users who contribute, and two nice books (and pardon because these are a little more detailed than what was there, ok to edit). Good luck. -
[SusanLesch]: Great place and great pics. This [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Image:Naniboujou_Lodge_DR.jpg one] is up for deletion. Why? -
[SusanLesch]: Greetings Elkman. Sorry to ping but I chose to mention your username ([http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:SusanLesch\/Archive\/11#Friday.2C_26_September_2008 archive]) on my user page. As a courtesy, this note. Thanks and apologies for breaking the news. -
[SusanLesch]: P.S. If you, Appraiser and your friends or anyone you know is interested and missed this note, ''MinnPost'''s first birthday party is tomorrow. I plan to be at [http:\/\/www.trocaderos.com\/ Trocaderos] for the [http:\/\/www.minnpost.com\/about\/debates\/ debate] on Friday, September 26, sometime, probably only a few minutes, between 7:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. In case cost is the only obstacle, which it is for some people including me, I forgot how much but some membership levels are quite inexpensive. -

I hope this note is within Wikipedia guidelines--the mysterious they--born of the necessity of being vendor neutral at W3C for about eight years--will get me for anything and I don't plan to ask Mr. Wales about this one. -
[SusanLesch]: Why would a candidate be consulted? Also, can you please remind me why KDBuffalo(sp?) is somewhere in the directory User talk:Appraiser? Thanks. -
[SusanLesch]: You're welcome, all two of you. I hope they enjoy their evening. I ain't going either, because, ''always'' someone is less fortunate. Cheers. -
[SusanLesch]: Thanks for your reply. There's at least one other instance of the same person's sockpuppet in there (I was mentioned by that person by name on your talk page and they gave me a barnstar). If there's time I will try to look that up tomorrow. The papers all say Republicans joined the fray but all I can relate to is the loss of Washington Mutual (in San Diego near Pacific Beach their office is what I call the \""beautiful bank\"" and JP Morgan Chase can't close on a house on time in my experience, but I'll live). -
[SusanLesch]: Hope you can make it. [[Wikipedia:Meetup\/Minneapolis#Alternate_2008_Meetup|Alternate meetup RSVP]]. -
[SusanLesch]: Too bad this edit of yours [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=List_of_people_from_Minnesota&diff=80136927&oldid=80124447 removed] the founder of Mars, Incorporated two years ago. Minneapolis might have been mentioned in today's PR Newswire burst about the Mars acquisition of Wrigley. I suppose I've made similarly unfortunate goofups. -
[SusanLesch]: Too bad. Beyond the [[List of Minneapolitans]] and follow ups, I had no interest in pursuing this topic in the first place and don't expect to look at it again in the near future. Rather than ask me, you might ask at [[Talk:Franklin Clarence Mars]] where someone posted three years ago. -
[SusanLesch]: Hi, Appraiser. In section \""McCain-Obama\"" above I mentioned I'd look this up. One of the accounts in [[:Category:Wikipedia sockpuppets of Kdbuffalo]] caused an autoblock during your RfA (partial [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User_talk:Appraiser\/Archive4#Unblock_please archive], or see edit history for this page on January 8, 2008). I apologize for any sign of mistrust but I use my real name on Wikipedia and am a female--most trolling and so on is carried out with women users, from what little I know. At least one other account in that category was active about a year ago, as you said during RfA, without any sign of vandalism. We all know that social engineering is a powerful force online. I guess because of some unrelated events I've come to question--if only a bit and only sometimes--all the barnstars and encouragement I received from you when I first joined Wikipedia. So even though it has negative aspects, I thought posting this note might help clear the air. -
[SusanLesch]: I could be, and am probably one of the few Wikipedians who has met you in person, four times I think. I enjoyed very much swinging on your childrens' swingset at your house. Last fall WikiProject Minnesota started to become a liability for me rather than what had seemed to be a hugely successful WikiProject. Sour grapes? Maybe so. Do you mind if I ask a senior sysop to check user? -
[SusanLesch]: Just updating the calendar for your talk page readers. -
[SusanLesch]: FYI [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Raul654&oldid=244150836#Check_user_question here's] what he said. -

Elcobbola wrote, \""Needs a verifiable source. As per above, an explicit assertion of authorship is needed. A hitherto deleted en.wiki page is not sufficient.\"" -

[SusanLesch]: Hello, Lampman. Am I wrong that no notice was given when [[Jeannette Piccard]] was delisted? I don't want to start a reassessment unless it is necessary because that area has a huge backlog. -

[SusanLesch]: Hi again. Yes I am interested in revising it. I replied on the [[Talk:Jeannette_Piccard\/GA1|GA review page]]. -
[SusanLesch]: Elcobbola replied on the delist page. I guess that I could edit the commons page and so I will. -
[SusanLesch]: Mattisse, thank you very much for finding a bad reference in [[Music of Minnesota]]. Two, however, of your taggings are wrong. Please take it easy. Why the sudden interest in this article? -

[SusanLesch]: Greetings, Brmull. Yes there are several reasons, first and not the least of which is professional respect for the first journalist in the United States to publish news of bin Laden's death. Second, the other reference from Reuters is dated the next day and it does't include the right info either (for example where does it say he died from shots to his chest and head?). Third, this was already discussed on the article talk page (Archive 1) and I think other editors should probably defer to that. Thanks for asking. -
