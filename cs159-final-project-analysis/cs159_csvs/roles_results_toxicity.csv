And many of us support and respect the work that the Wikipedia community does to create quality articles. We understand and have studied policies and guidelines, and more than one of us have edited a page or two. I am reaching out to the Wikipedia community to help us develop appropriate guidelines and policies for external_link and our participation. COI guidelines seem to discourage employees from editing on behalf of employers, but we frequently see information that is unclear or sometimes wrong. While we know we can just edit, we want to do so transparently and acceptably. There is concern that we will offend the Wikipedia community and encourage negative attention if we get this wrong. On the other hand, there are great resources in the federal (and state and local) space that would be valuable to Wikipedia users, and we know about them, and can cite them, too. So, what are the best ways for federal employees to contribute to this project? For example, some federal editors will only edit in their official capacity from a government computer with a government IP and from a Wikipedia account. Should that account indicate the name of the agency? Whether it is a communications or a program office? I don't think there would be any controversy on editing dates that are incorrect or improving a reference or correcting an error (like which agency has jurisdiction over an area). Are there things that we ''shouldn't'' edit? For substantive changes, should we be explicit about our roles on talk pages? If we don't get any feedback on proposed changes, how long should we wait until we make the change ourselves? Other ideas/areas/pitfalls? The goal is to create guidelines and best practices for the federal web community. We will publish on external_link.

228468167.5005.5005,"Hello Skyring(Pete). I notice you have reverted edits on the Howard article recently. I thought we had all moved away from that kind of mode of editing. Reverts subvert the wishes of the editing community as a whole. It's better to allow the editing community to decide whether content stays or goes. Content disputes need to go through the dispute resolution process. In regard to the particular sentence about public figures who considered Howard's Iraq policy as contravening international laws against war crimes, I've got no idea if the issue gets put to the community to decide whether it would live or die. It could go either way. But then we just have to accept the community decision. The concept is that by letting the community decide, the audience of Wikipedia readers gets the type of encyclopaedia that they want (or deserve). My opinion is that reverting will only lead to trouble. If edit wars break out, then it will only lead to penalties or sanctions against those who partake.''''''

I see two routes out of the conundrum of wanting an article on ''the'' credit crunch whilst trying to write about ' ''all'' ' credit-crunches (of which I speculate there have been no other events so named): Somebody proves me comprehensively wrong and finds authoritative, academic, or otherwise peer-reviewed sources we can cite in this tertiary source.

Knowing that you have been a significant contributor to the article wiki_link, perhaps you could provide an alternate opinion. Even though it wasn't the first or deadliest school shooting, I still believe it was a very notable event that affected the nation and world in many ways in the year 2008 (gun politics, higher education, mental health, journalism ethics, video game politics, emergency preparedness, etc.). I even backed it up with three international sources (from Australia and the U.K.), which I felt demonstrated the event's global importance. Unfortunately, people disagreed with that. Mind you, the event had been listed in that article all year, and only did it become a problem when I tried to add an image on the article recently. I stopped trying to put the image on there, but then they outright deleted the text entry about the event, which I thought was very uncalled for, and utterly ridiculous, considering it was perhaps one of the biggest media events of the year. Perhaps you could help revert this senseless deletion of a notable entry and provide some input on the wiki_link. Thanks for your help!
Regrettably, I feel that this simply demonstrates how inane it is to have articles on years and decades.  I agree with you that it was a noteworthy event, but such things are infinitely subjective, and (I feel) not worth the effort needed to wage the battle.  I would rather be Don Quixote and take on the ''existence of the article wiki_link''.  I mean, what makes ''this'' year particularly noteworthy?  I think that 1989, 1848, and 1776 are all exceptional years, and more worthy of an article than, say, 1922.  We don't provide every author an article just because he wrote a book, and we don't give every American mayor an article, even if he is re-elected three times.  We are supposed to touch upon the ''noteworthy''.  The NIU shooting is more notable than many events in wiki_link, but wiki_link is not worth the time of day to me (at least, not yet.

513868198.3527.3527,"Hello, I have observed that since this century turned, new cars have had headlamp lenses made out of plastic. Before headlamp lenses were made out of thick glass that reminded me of wiki_link cooking vessels intended for use inside an oven. Is it true that it was in fact heat-resistant borosilicate glass? What is the plastic in use nowadays? I suppose it is wiki_link plastic, but is it regular or somehow treated/coated? I would want answers to these questions in the article. Also, were the transition to plastic lenses possible only after halogen lamps became history? I believe that halogen lamps emitted so much heat that polycarbonate would have melted. So, if the transition was only possible because of technological development in lamps, and a consequence of this (better efficiency, less heat), please point it out in the article. Also, I suppose the use of plastic resulted in weight savings, but is there some drawbacks in plastic? I found some info about high heat polycarbonate.

This  says that US makers started using plastic headlamps in the 1980's to save weight. The polycarbonate plastic is less dense than glass, adn the whole reflector/lens assembly can be made with fewer metal parts, further reducing weight. Google Books says Popular Mechanics was writing about plastic lenss in cars in 1991 (comparing their high replacement cost with the cheap sealed beam bulbs). I don't think old-time glass lenses were anything special but maybe I can find a reference as to the kind of glass used; recall that an old-time ""sealed beam"" used to sell for a coupe of bucks, so I doubt the glass was anything otehr than good old soda-lime ( or maybe with some lead oxide?). So, I don't think it was tied to halogen lamps as much as to the push to save weight in the days of ever-decreasing CAFE standards.

Cheers, I am somewhat shocked at how undeveloped this article is, considering its importance. Compare it to the articles on the Chinese wiki_link and wiki_link—the other principle powers of the day—or even the subsequent wiki_link; it is simply paltry in comparison.
As exclaimed on my talk page, I am currently in semi-retirement from Wiki. However, I would certainly spare some of my time to provide aid to anyone seeking to expand this article. By this I mean doing research into academic sources and providing much-needed citations throughout the article. Is anyone willing to tackle this problem with serious time and effort? If so, drop a note here or on my talk page and I would love to assist.

500740708.19926.19926,"What level of ""Proof"" are various editors looking for? In my case, I knew my long deceased grandfather was on the Dawes Rolls taken of the Cherokee in the early 1900s. However, it took almost 40 years (no exaggeration) to find enough ""proof"" to meet BIA standards to get a Certified Degree of Indian Blood (CDIB) card. After that, getting Cherokee Nation citizenship was easy.
Years ago, I recall the State of California telling me I could not claim to be of Cherokee ancestry on official forms because I was not a citizen at the time. That was extremely frustrating. Five years later when I was a citizen, the state no longer had that section on their forms.
I can see omitting people who have made a claim of ancestry, but documentation shows they are not. I have come across many people who ""feel"" they are American Indian, but have no specific details.
Perhaps the editors who wish to delete some questionable people could contact those people directly to see if they want to be on the list; and if so, could they provide some proof of their claim or the basis of their claim. Then the editors could at least have something to go on.
FYI, while the Cherokee Nation has approximately 300,000 enrolled citizens, over 750,000 people self-claimed Cherokee ancestry during the most recent census. Many people are familiar with the part of Cherokee history called the Trail of Tears which moved the Cherokees to Indian Territory (Oklahoma) in the 1830s. However, many Cherokees left our ancestral lands decades before the removal. Many settled in what now is Arkansas and Missouri. After the ""Trail,"" The US government took numerous rolls of tribal members. If you did not live in the ""official"" Cherokee lands in Indian Territory, you were not included in those rolls. All of those Cherokees in Arkansas and Missouri (just to name a few, others went to Mexico/Texas, etc.) were not included in most rolls. Presently, the Cherokee Nation's primary requirement to become a citizen is being able to trace your blood ancestry back to anyone listed as Cherokee on the Dawes rolls. It does not matter what your blood-quantum is, just verifiable Cherokee blood. So, if your full-blooded Cherokee grandfather and your full-blooded Cherokee grandmother were not on the rolls, you will not be able to become a citizen of the Cherokee Nation, even if you are full-blooded Cherokee.

I just want to inform you that something terrible happened in the Japanese Wikipedia.
They implemented a so-called ""local rule"" for AKB48-related articles that prohibits adding member lists for B-sides into articles about AKB48's singles. It also says to order the remaining list alphabetically and not by teams. IP editors have tried to put the lists back, but they are being reverted. I personally think that the articles are ruined and that the Japanese Wikipedia has became absolutely useless for anyone who wants to browse through AKB48's releases.
The proposal that resulted in the rule had remained practically unnoticed or ignored. I wonder why. There were just 2–3 editors, and they decided everything for everyone. I didn't notice it too.
Actually, it's not like they deleted the info from Wikipedia, they moved it all into the monstrous wiki_link. The list is very long and completely unusable. (I think some people like to make very long lists for everything. This is especially true for the Japanese Wikipedia.)
That's just for your information. I am thinking about proposing to allow the lists back into the articles and to rearrange them as before, exactly as in the CD booklets. But it won't be now. Now I am not going to do anything. It would be nice if someone with a better knowledge of Japanese offers help in composing the proposal.

Dear Kotiwalo thank you for your calm answer,
However,
The official name of the country as per United Nations is ""Former Yugoslavic Republic of Macedonia"".
How can Wikipedia override United Nations' Decisions and Conventions? On which grounds?
This country was recognized as ""Republic of Macedonia"" by GW Bush administration, possibly the worst US President the world has ever known. In my opinion the latter says it all.
Inhabitants of this country don't know what the term ""Macedonia"" means, whereas in Greek,the term Macedons mean either those
who are tall, either those who come from up (the north), this deriving from the root ""mak"" (makrys/macrys meaning long/tall.
Modern inhabitants of FYROM claim being ascendants of Ancient Macedons but they cannot read their scipts whereas we Greeks can.

As a hobby botanist I have a lot of Crocus species in my garden, including several autumn-flowering ones. I have also put several pictures of them on Commons, including one of the rare Crocus matthewii.

I find the changes made by  premature since they are based on recent (March 2009) phylogenic work, which have to be confirmed by ""further studies"" to consider a new hierachical system of classification. Futhermore the changes made by  are not user-friendly (strikethrough words, paragraph in parentheses) and are even source of confusion, because not in full accordance with the text he has added.

Splitting the track listing is unnecessary, especially if the article has never had the bonus tracks split in the first place (that's generally how things are done on Wikipedia: if there is more than one way of doing things, stick with how it was done first, like using one date format vs. another (wiki_link)).
Additionally, avoid using the collapse parameter unless it's necessary: ""Include this parameter with the value yes (|collapsed=yes) to have the track listing table start out collapsed. Useful for very long lists or pages with several lists. This parameter only takes effect in JavaScript-enabled browsers."" (emphasis mine). Two lists is hardly ""several lists"".
Here's an example of when it's good to split off track lists and collapse them: wiki_link. One long list and several different sets of bonus tracks. But an album with only two editions can just have the bonus tracks kept in the same listing and use the note parameter to denote bonus tracks.
Thanks! (moved per the header clearly visible on my talk page) Why do you revert my edits all the time just for the sake of reverting them? Plus in wiki_link there is nothing at all that states what you are getting at. I'd advise you to look at wiki_link because you seem to have a big problem with someone editing the page after you. •
::I'm not reverting simply for the sake of reverting them. I gave you good reasons for why I reverted your changes: a format had already been set up on the page, the format that was originally there is supported by wiki_link (as I copied/pasted above (if you didn't understand what I was getting at, please tell me what you didn't understand and I can try to explain it more clearly)), and you gave no good reason for making that change.

::Generally your edits are fine; you've been editing a long time and know what you're doing. The problem arises when you either make pointless edits like this that go against Template usage, or poor grammar edits that need to be corrected (like that edit you made on wiki_link that turned a grammatically-correct sentence into one that was grammatically incorrect), or when you make broad genre changes on articles (like trying to distill a band's genres to something as useless as ""rock"" when they're a metal band) without any discussion whatsoever. If I revert an edit you make, instead of just un-reverting it and leaving unrelated edit summaries (""Per overlinking""? What overlinking was done there?), start a discussion on the talk page. Maybe there's a good reason to change it that I haven't seen, or maybe your edit just wasn't a good idea. Either way, it can be hashed out and a decision made, instead of us reverting each other's edits.

342231636.4813.4813,"[]  I am seriously concerned about your editing behavior on Climatic Research Unit hacking incident. If it continues in the vein I have seen, I will likley seek to have you barred from further participation on the article. Here are some notes on things you could do to improve your editing.
1. You need to seek consensus for changes that may be controvercial, as opposed to merely making those changes and hoping that they are either missed or that they are protected by the 1rr probation the article is under. There are a number of ways you could do this - you could propose your changes on the talk page and then wait for many comments, specifically looking for comments from people that have problems with your edits, correcting the problems they have, and then resoliciting their opinion. Another option is to make the changes you would like to the article, but expressly state that any editor may revert them, or that you would revert them on demand.
2. Blogs are never acceptable sources. If the only source you can find for something is a blog, it should never be included in an article. If you are sure something is true - it's not. You need a source for all information you intend to put in the article.
3. You should ""write for the enemy"" - when you are making an edit, be sure you know what the response from people who are traditionally on the other side of the debate from you would think of it, and make specific consessions to what problems you would expect them to have with it.
4. Edit summaries should be accurate. If you are reverting, note that. If you are making multiple changes, don't just mention one change and hope the rest go under the radar.
If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

205710474.27731.27731,"In the first chapter of Communion and Otherness, Zizioulas surveys 20th century Western thinking on personhood in Husserl, Heidegger, and Sartre, and then discusses how two Jewish thinkers – Buber and Levinas – make significant philosophical advances over them. However, he then goes on to show how both Buber and Levinas fall short of patristic thinking on personhood. He clearly sees Levinas as coming closest to the patristic understanding, but he points out how, e.g., Dionysius the Areopagite and St Maximus Confessor are superior to Levinas. The same is true of Macmurray, whom Zizioulas credits as having made an insightful critique of other Western views on personhood; he does not, however, base his own thinking of that of Macmurray. Interacting with non-Orthodox philosophers, and acknowledging what is worthwhile and what is deficient in their thinking when compared to the Church Fathers, is not a reason to criticize Zizioulas. The same criticisms have been made of Lossky. In neither case do they hit the mark.
