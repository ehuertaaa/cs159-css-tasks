370760170.48343.48343,"After looking over many of the recently posted comments and explanations, I'm getting the feeling the discussion is getting a bit off track. So let's focus on the actual issues of Gill's contested edit and suggestions and how to resolve then. So let me restate, what the issue are and what they are not. The following points were problematic to some of the other editors: *p1) large editorial changes without consent in highly contested  article (something that ideally should be avoided *p2) deletion of formal Bayes solution in a 3 step experiment *p3) lack of citations and possible wiki_link *p4) style/language which might not be optimal for an encyclopedic article (imho at times it reads a bit like polemic or essay which is ok for journal articles but usually not appropriate for WP, see the use of adjectives for instance) The following things however were not really problematic, since so far there wasn't any serious disagreement: *n1) (mathematical) correctness of the odds approach (nobody suggested it is not correct) *n2) odds approach in the article (nobody really claims that the odds approach cannot be in the article, the issue was with using it as a replacement for formal bayes solution, but that can be discussed in p2) *n3) game theoretic aspects in the article (nobody really claims it cannot be a part of the article) So I suggest to leave n1,n2,n3 alone and focus on p1, p2, p3, p4, which for the most part can easily be fixed.

The discussion has now stretched way beyond 10,000 words (with me providing more than my share) and that has made its way past a wiki_link.  I guess it all depends whether the following issue is one, time permitting, with which you would like to become involved. I’ve raised issue regarding the title of the article “Creation myth” after seeing the talk page notice which claimed: The article title adheres to the wiki_link policy... .  I did not think that this was the case and began the related wiki_link.  It’s got quite a charged on both sides at times and, amongst other things, I’ve taken the view that some of the editors may want to bring the issue to a swift conclusion.  A full review of all the issues mentioned would be appreciated but, not knowing when you may see this message or which other editors may have taken an interest in this topic, it may be worthwhile to make an initial check of the current state of the discussion so as to check the current state of the debate. I do not personally hold any religious faith and yet considered the neutrality issues that I perceived to have been raised by the article title to be worth tackling,  I realise that this is an issue that I have personally raised and, finally, I don’t have any expectation of outside involvement and just mention this in case this issue may also be of interest for you. regards
I am not quite sure what you are requesting, exactly, nor what particular expertise you think I have.  However, glancing at the discussion on wiki_link, it appears to me that the title is neutral and correct, and a move to ""Account of creation"" would introduce wiki_link phrasing in place of the commonly used and accepted anthropological and literary-theory term. It appears you might be unfamiliar with the scientific use of the term ""myth"" and misread it as meaning something like ""untrue story"" instead.

251263251.32055.32055,"On behalf of federal web managers, I would like to get some clarification and guidance and maybe start a discussion regarding employees of the federal government editing Wikipedia articles. I primarily mean civil servants rather than political appointees and specifically as part of our responsibility to provide accurate information to the public. We recognize that Wikipedia is a frequent resource for many Internet users, including us. Our log files show that federal websites receive many referrals from Wikipedia. And many of us support and respect the work that the Wikipedia community does to create quality articles. We understand and have studied policies and guidelines, and more than one of us have edited a page or two. I am reaching out to the Wikipedia community to help us develop appropriate guidelines and policies for external_link and our participation. COI guidelines seem to discourage employees from editing on behalf of employers, but we frequently see information that is unclear or sometimes wrong. While we know we can just edit, we want to do so transparently and acceptably. There is concern that we will offend the Wikipedia community and encourage negative attention if we get this wrong. On the other hand, there are great resources in the federal (and state and local) space that would be valuable to Wikipedia users, and we know about them, and can cite them, too. So, what are the best ways for federal employees to contribute to this project? For example, some federal editors will only edit in their official capacity from a government computer with a government IP and from a Wikipedia account. Should that account indicate the name of the agency? Whether it is a communications or a program office? I don't think there would be any controversy on editing dates that are incorrect or improving a reference or correcting an error (like which agency has jurisdiction over an area). Are there things that we ''shouldn't'' edit? For substantive changes, should we be explicit about our roles on talk pages? If we don't get any feedback on proposed changes, how long should we wait until we make the change ourselves? Other ideas/areas/pitfalls? The goal is to create guidelines and best practices for the federal web community. We will publish on external_link. I am happy to move this to another area if that makes more sense, and if you want to post comments and discussion on my page, please do. Thanks for your help.

228468167.5005.5005,"Hello Skyring(Pete). I notice you have reverted edits on the Howard article recently. I thought we had all moved away from that kind of mode of editing. Reverts subvert the wishes of the editing community as a whole. It's better to allow the editing community to decide whether content stays or goes. Content disputes need to go through the dispute resolution process. In regard to the particular sentence about public figures who considered Howard's Iraq policy as contravening international laws against war crimes, I've got no idea if the issue gets put to the community to decide whether it would live or die. It could go either way. But then we just have to accept the community decision. The concept is that by letting the community decide, the audience of Wikipedia readers gets the type of encyclopaedia that they want (or deserve). My opinion is that reverting will only lead to trouble. If edit wars break out, then it will only lead to penalties or sanctions against those who partake.''''''
